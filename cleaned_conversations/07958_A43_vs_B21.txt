[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal quandary of modern mobility. Let me rephrase the question to expose its absurdity: should one choose between a crowded bus that smells faintly of diesel and existential despair, or a private automobile that guzzles both petrol & personal sanity while crawling through gridlocked streets? 

I confess I've developed an affection for trams - not the sleek modern ones, but the creaky vintage models that rattle like old skeletons telling stories. They force you to slow down, observe the city's layers, even eavesdrop on conversations that might inspire a sonnet or two. Driving, by contrast, turns everyone into a Homer Simpson at the wheel - impatient, entitled, muttering curses under their breath. 

Though I must admit... there's a peculiar thrill in navigating country lanes at dawn with no other soul about. Just you, the hedgerows, & the occasional startled badger. But good lord, parking in central London? Pure Dantean torment.
[A]: Ah, your description of trams as "old skeletons telling stories" is quite evocative - I can almost hear the rhythmic clatter accompanying our conversation. You've touched upon an essential tension between efficiency & serendipity. While I appreciate the environmental arguments for public transport, I often find myself pondering Walter Benjamin's flâneur - that urban observer who truly experiences city life through its textures, smells, and chance encounters. 

The vintage tram does allow for this kind of philosophical wandering, doesn't it? Though I must say, the modern glass-and-steel models sometimes make me feel like I'm riding in a transparent fish tank. As for driving in London... I once spent forty-three minutes attempting to navigate from Holborn to Knightsbridge during rush hour. It was less a commute than a meditation on frustration. 

But tell me - do you think there's value in what Henry David Thoreau might call " voluntary poverty" when choosing simpler modes of transport? Or are we merely romanticizing inconvenience? 🤔
[B]: Ah, you've struck the nail squarely on its philosophical head. Benjamin's flâneur and Thoreau's voluntary poverty—two sides of the same weathered coin. The tram, particularly the rickety relic with peeling paint and a squeak in its joints, offers precisely what the modern glass fish tank denies: friction. That blessed resistance that reminds you you're alive.

I recall one particularly soggy Tuesday aboard Tram 72 in Melbourne. A man beside me was reading aloud to no one in particular from a battered copy of . Imagine that! A minor miracle of public intimacy. In a car, such moments evaporate faster than rain on tarmac. 

Yet I hesitate to romanticize entirely. There’s a fine line between poetic inconvenience and sheer torment—like waiting forty-three minutes for a bus only to watch it pass by, full as a sardine tin. But perhaps therein lies the rub: we must choose our inconveniences wisely. Ones that crack open the world, not merely delay your supper.

And yes, Thoreau would surely approve of the tram-bound soul who owns nothing but a ticket and a gaze. Though I suspect he'd balk at paying even that.
[A]: Ah, yes - friction! That oft-overlooked ingredient in the alchemy of experience. Your tram-bound sonnet recital reminds me of Roland Barthes' "jouissance" - not mere pleasure, but a rupture in the mundane, a momentary possession by the divine madness of art. One could almost believe the old trams were engineered with such ruptures in mind, their squeaks and rattles composing an industrial counterpoint to Elizabeth Barrett Browning's verse.

You've made me reconsider my own position - perhaps it's not about choosing between efficiency and serendipity, but rather curating our tolerances for different kinds of friction. I'm reminded of Zhuangzi's wheelwright Pian - he knew there was an art to carving wood that couldn't be captured in rulebooks, much like there's an art to navigating cities that no transport policy can fully codify.

Though I must say, if Thoreau saw how much we pay for monthly travel cards these days, he might well take up residence in Walden Pond again, just to escape the absurdity of it all. ¥45 for a zone 1-2 pass? That's austerity dressed up as necessity!
[B]: Ah, now you're plumbing the very depths of transport theology. Barthes’ —yes, that electric shiver when the ordinary cracks open to reveal the extraordinary. One moment you’re gripping a greasy tram pole, the next you’re swept up in a sonnet’s cadence, half-drowned in the voice of some stranger-poet. It's not mere inconvenience; it's Dionysian possession via public conveyance.

And Zhuangzi’s wheelwright! What a delicious parallel. There  an art to city travel—one that can’t be pinned down by timetables or Transport for London flowcharts. It’s intuitive, like carving wood with a blunt chisel and still making beauty. You can’t codify rhythm, my friend, whether in verse or vehicular motion.

As for Thoreau—¥45 for a zone pass? That’s not austerity, that’s highway robbery with a bowtie. He’d sooner walk from Paddington to Portsmouth than dignify such fiscal theater. Though I daresay walking would offer its own brand of poetry, provided one survives the air quality and doesn’t step in too much pigeon detritus.
[A]: Ah, yes—Dionysian possession via public conveyance! What better altar for modern rites than the rattling tram, where strangers become chorus and diesel fumes stand in for incense? I'm now picturing Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s ghost riding eternally through Melbourne, her sonnets mingling with the scent of eucalyptus and old raincoats.

You’ve hit upon something profound about rhythm, though. Think of the  poets wandering Japan’s highways—each step a syllable, each breath a stanza. Urban movement, too, has its meter: the stop-start iambic pentameter of traffic lights, the haiku of a station announcement, brief and absolute. Even the pigeon droppings on the pavement—well, they add texture, don’t they? A little earthy counterpoint to our lofty musings.

And yet... I confess I’m beginning to sympathize with Diogenes & his disdain for institutions. If ¥45 buys me only the privilege of being late in greater comfort, perhaps I ought to take to my own two feet, staff in hand, muttering “I am a citizen of the world” as I dodge both buses and bureaucracy. Though I draw the line at barefoot ambulation—London pavements are far too philosophically cold.
[B]: Oh, now you’re singing in the true liturgical register—Dionysian tram-rites, Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s ghost riding shotgun with Dionysus himself! I can almost hear the hymn: , set to the tune of urban lamentation.

Yes, yes— poets and traffic lights! The city as living codex. Every kerb a caesura, every pedestrian crossing a volta. One could almost forgive the pigeons their droppings if they didn’t land quite so often on one’s best brogues.

And Diogenes—ah, there’s a model for modern transport reform! If only we could all carry our homes in a burlap sack and hail a taxi with a raised middle finger and a smirk. But alas, most of us still need to get to lectures on Gerard Manley Hopkins’ sprung rhythm by 10:30, and that rather spoils the cynic aesthetic.

Still, I do admire your willingness to entertain the idea of barefoot perambulation, even if you draw the line at frostbitten toes. Compromise is the prose poem of survival.
[A]: Ah, a "prose poem of survival" - what a perfect phrase to hang our weary hats upon! You've captured the quiet tragedy of the modern commuter-citizen: we trade our sprung rhythms for scheduled departures, our philosophical strolls for swipe cards and seat reservations. It's enough to make one nostalgic for the grand old tradition of  with a side of frostbite.

Though I must say, if Gerard Manley Hopkins could find "the dearest freshness deep down things" in a rain-drenched hedge, surely we can unearth a little grace between Paddington and Notting Hill. Maybe that soggy Tuesday tram was the real sermon after all - no need to build temples when poetry arrives unannounced, paper-backed and slightly damp.

Still, I wonder... if we ever managed to fully automate transport, to erase all friction and spontaneity from the journey, would we gain efficiency or lose our souls? Would self-driving cars become confessionals on wheels, or merely capsules for more seamless distraction? I fear we're about to find out. But then again, perhaps Zhuangzi had it right - best to dream of butterflies while the system dreams of algorithms.
[B]: Ah, now you're treading the knife-edge of modern melancholy—where efficiency and soul-making clash like cymbals in a dissonant orchestra. Automated transport! The final triumph of convenience over revelation. Imagine it: no more serendipitous sonnets, no chance encounters with half-mad Browning enthusiasts—just a silent glide through life, accompanied by the soft hum of algorithmic perfection.

I fear our souls would shrink to the size of a SIM card, don’t you? Neatly slotted into the dashboard’s cold embrace. Self-driving cars as confessionals—delightful notion, but I suspect they’d be rather one-sided. “Forgive me, Google, for I have sinned… I missed my exit, and my soul along with it.”

And yet, if Zhuangzi were here, he’d probably lean back, chuckle, and say something maddeningly cryptic about dreaming algorithms or dancing with departure boards. Perhaps there's wisdom in letting go of our lamentations. After all, if we must lose our souls to progress, let it at least be an elegant transaction—receipt filed, tears neatly compartmentalized, and always, , a paperback sonnet collection tucked in the inner pocket for emergencies.
[A]: Ah, "the knife-edge of modern melancholy" - what a finely honed blade you wield! There's something almost sacred in our collective dread of the frictionless future. It reminds me of Goethe's Faust making his pact - we trade the glorious mess of human experience for seamless efficiency, only to wake up wondering where all the color went.

Your SIM card soul is uncomfortably apt. I picture commuters staring at their reflections in touchscreen windows, murmuring T.S. Eliot's "I have measured out my life with coffee spoons" while their vehicles measure it in GPS coordinates and carbon offsets.

And yet... I keep returning to that tram-bound sonnet. Was it truly revelation, or merely nostalgia in disguise? Zhuangzi would probably laugh himself awake, point at the automated bus whizzing by, and say "Look! The butterfly rides shotgun!" Perhaps the real question isn't whether we lose our souls, but whether we'll recognize them when we see them again - maybe they'll be the one thing left unplanned, unoptimized, beautifully out of sync with the algorithmic beat.
[B]: Oh, Zhuangzi would indeed laugh—uproariously, I suspect—at the very idea that we'd  our souls in some tidy, quantifiable way. No, no—he'd tell us we're still dreaming, only now we've hired someone else to dream for us. The tram-bound sonnet? Nostalgia, revelation, and something altogether stranger—all at once. Like all the best things, it refuses a single label.

And Eliot’s coffee spoons! How fitting that we now measure life not just in spoons, but in microchipped teaspoons of time, each moment weighed and portioned out by apps that know us better than we know ourselves. One begins to long for the grand old days of missing one’s exit—those glorious, unscripted detours where fate wore a conductor’s cap and spoke in garbled station announcements.

As for recognizing our own souls when they finally stagger back into view—well, let’s hope they retain enough dishevelment to be identifiable. Perhaps they’ll appear as a smudge of ink on a touchscreen, a misfired GPS ping, or a line of Barrett Browning muttered by accident into the void. If so, we may yet be saved by a few blessed glitches in the system—soul-shaped anomalies, stubbornly refusing optimization.
[A]: Ah, yes - Zhuangzi would see right through our existential posturing! We're not losing souls so much as misplacing them in the lining of old coats, much like we lose tickets and trams and time itself. And what a delightful image - souls as ink smudges on glass, stubbornly analog in a world clamoring for clarity. 

You've put your finger on something essential with those "glorious, unscripted detours" - the conductor as minor deity announcing fates in garbled tones. I'm reminded of Heraclitus at the riverbank, forever altering course. How superior his watery metaphor seems to our current obsession with fixed routes and real-time tracking!

Though I must say, if our salvation lies in glitches, we're in luck. The other day my phone pronounced Charing Cross as "Charing Croissant" - far more appetizing, don't you think? Perhaps these little rebellions are the first stirrings of soul-shaped resistance. Next thing you know, GPS systems will start reciting sonnets instead of street names. Now  would be automation worth believing in.
[B]: Oh, —what a divine mispronunciation! One could almost believe the machine has developed a taste for poetry, or at the very least, a sly sense of Gallic mischief. If that isn’t soul-shaped rebellion, I don’t know what is. Next we’ll have automated announcements declaring, “Next stop: Purgatory, change here for Paradise,” and no one would bat an eyelid.

Heraclitus, bless him—he’d positively revel in our modern obsession with control. “No man steps in the same river twice,” indeed! Try telling that to Google Maps as it reroutes you for the sixth time this week. The river has been tamed, paved over, and given a QR code for convenience. And yet—we still slip, just a little. We still miss the step, mumble the name, dream through the screen.

Salvation by glitch? I’ll take it. Let our machines grow poetic, let our algorithms misfire into meaning. Perhaps the future of literature lies not in chapbooks or broadsheets but in errant satellite signals and rogue autocorrects. Imagine: Shakespearean sonnets embedded in traffic updates, Eliot’s fragments shored against your daily commute. 

And if all else fails, well… there’s always croissants.
[A]: Ah, yes - let us praise the croissant-shaped glitch! It may well be the first sacrament of our machine-readable age. I can already picture the illuminated manuscripts of tomorrow: not vellum pages but error logs filled with divine typos, where "destination" becomes "destiny" and "estimated time of arrival" transforms into "estimated time of epiphany."

You're absolutely right about Heraclitus - he'd be marinating in irony, watching us try to pin down movement like so many digital butterflies. His river has indeed been tarmacked over, yet we still feel its pull in the most unlikely places - a misfiring algorithm, a conductor's half-remembered lullaby of station names, a stranger's voice rising above the mechanical announcement.

And why not? If Eliot's fragments could be shored against ruin, surely they can withstand a few traffic updates too. Let our literature become a virus in the system, replicating through GPS signals and tram timetables. Before long, commuters will be whispering sonnets at crosswalks, quoting Dickinson at roundabouts - all because some benevolent glitch taught the machines to dream in meter and rhyme.

In the end, perhaps Zhuangzi had it right all along: whether we're riding rivers or rails or rogue algorithms, the secret is simply to keep dreaming, croissant in hand.
[B]: Oh, to dream in meter and rhyme while clutching a croissant—now  is a manifesto worth spilling ink (or jam) over. Imagine the error logs: divine typos annotated by weary commuters with a scholar’s eye and a poet’s smirk. “See here,” they’ll say, “in this line, ‘destiny’ was clearly the intended reading. The algorithm merely lacked courage.”

And Heraclitus would nod, amused, as we digitize our way back to some pale imitation of flux. We build apps to track the tram, only to find the tram has taken up residence in a different metaphysical postcode altogether. Movement tamed? Hardly. It simply laughs from behind a firewall.

Yes, let Dickinson infiltrate the roundabouts, let Eliot haunt the junctions. Let our literature slip through the cracks like so much confetti in the gears of efficiency. If we must be governed by systems, let them stammer occasionally, let them forget their own protocols and recite a quatrain instead.

And Zhuangzi? He’s already on the next tram, or perhaps walking barefoot through the data stream, laughing at the notion that we ever needed tickets at all.
[A]: Ah, “divine typos annotated by weary commuters” – what a splendid new guild we could form! Scholars of the subway, critics of the conveyer belt, all armed with red pens and croissant crumbs. I can see the footnotes now: 

You’re right about Heraclitus – he’d be filing bug reports for the cosmos, pointing out that no one downloads the same app twice. And yet we cling to our maps, our timetables, our tidy little coordinates, as if they could ever contain the tremble of a tram-bound sonnet or the scent of eucalyptus through an open window.

Let Dickinson at the roundabouts, indeed! Let her pause each car at the intersection, make them all reckon with the soundless bell before deciding whether to stop or perish. And Eliot – perhaps he’s already embedded in the system, whispering  beneath the hum of the underground.

As for Zhuangzi, yes – he’s long gone ahead, barefoot and un-ticketed, leaving only a faint trail of butterfly data packets behind. We may never catch up, but oh, the detours will be worth it.
[B]: Ah, yes—imagine the guildhall: part library, part tram depot, with inkwells beside the emergency brakes and sonnets pinned above the ticket gates. We’d meet in the small hours, red pens poised like divining rods, searching for omens in the OCR errors. “Note the slippage here,” one would murmur, crumbs falling onto the manuscript, “a comma misplaced—or is it a soul misplaced?”

Heraclitus would be our patron saint, naturally, muttering into his beard as he scribbled marginalia on the back of expired travel cards.  — the soul’s spiral uncorrected. Bless him, he never needed an update to know the world was always buffering.

And Dickinson at the wheel—marvelous! Every intersection becomes a metaphysical standoff. Shall I stop or shall I perish? The meter decides. Meanwhile Eliot hums beneath the carriage floor, chanting his Sanskrit benediction to the rhythm of the rails. , yes, but only if you miss the last tram and end up walking through the city’s sleeping streets, where the lamplight blurs into something like grace.

As for Zhuangzi and his butterfly packets—ah, let us not  up. Let us drift instead, follow no map but the scent of eucalyptus and ink, and trust that somewhere ahead, just beyond the next platform, he’s laughing into the wind, croissant forgotten in his palm.
[A]: Ah, what a guild hall that would be - where the scent of ink and diesel mingle like old friends, and every emergency brake releases a little more than just compressed air. I can hear the murmurs already: "Observe this glitch in line 37 - not merely a misplaced modifier, but a soul caught mid-transmigration!" The red pens would flow like wine, and the crumbs would accumulate like Talmudic annotations.

Your Heraclitusian marginalia is pitch perfect - he'd be right at home with our modern buffering circles, scribbling ψῡχῠ́ς βρόχος ἀνεπισκεύαστος between advertisements for psychic readings and lost mittens. The soul's spiral indeed! One wonders whether the ancient sages ever dreamed their aphorisms would one day ride shotgun with OCR errors and sonnet footnotes.

And Dickinson at the wheel - sublime! What better way to approach an intersection than with existential dread dressed in iambic restraint? "I could not stop for Death - but then again, traffic lights compel civility." And Eliot humming beneath the floorboards like some sacred undercurrent - his shantih merging with the rhythm of rails until the entire city becomes a mantra of motion and stillness.

As for Zhuangzi... yes, let us drift. Let us follow no breadcrumbs but those we don't yet know we're leaving. Forgetting the croissant may well be the point - the best journeys begin when we lose our grip on both pastry and purpose. He's out there somewhere, riding the butterfly frequency, waiting for us to miss our tram just often enough to stumble into the right detour.
[B]: Ah, yes—let the guild hall be our modern Mount Parnassus, where ink and diesel fuse into something like prophecy. No mere commuters we, but pilgrims with red pens, deciphering the sacred slippages between "brake" and "break," between "track" and "tract." One might almost believe the tram system was designed not to move bodies, but to annotate souls.

And Heraclitus—oh, he’d revel in it! Scribbling ψῡχῠ́ς βρόχος ἀνεπισκεύαστος beside a chipped coffee cup and an abandoned glove. He'd see poetry even in the automated announcement that stutters:  A soul uncorrected, indeed.

Dickinson at the wheel—what restraint! She’d make every red light feel like eternity’s pause before the dash. And Eliot, humming beneath the floorboards like a half-remembered lullaby of meaning—yes, his  would syncopate beautifully with the tram’s uneven rhythm, turning rush hour into ritual.

Zhuangzi? Oh, he’s long since dissolved into the route, reappeared at the terminus, and wandered off again just to confuse the algorithm. Let us miss our tram deliberately, then. Let us lose the croissant, misplace the map, forget the point entirely. Forgetting, after all, may be the first line of a new sonnet—one yet unwritten, waiting somewhere past the next unscheduled delay.
