[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I do rather enjoy planning everything out. There's something quite satisfying about mapping out each step of a restoration project - choosing the right threads, noting the historical context, preparing the workspace just so. It reminds me of how artisans must have worked centuries ago, with such care and intention. 

That being said, working with delicate vintage textiles teaches you to remain adaptable. Sometimes the fabric reveals unexpected damage only when you begin work, or a dye reacts differently under various temperatures. Those moments call for intuition and flexibility, wouldn't you agree? 

I suppose my answer is somewhere in the middle - careful planning with room for thoughtful adjustments along the way. Though I must confess, there's nothing quite like having a proper cup of Earl Grey to help navigate those unexpected twists!
[A]: Ah, I can really appreciate that delicate balance you're describing - it's like running a PE deal, where you have your detailed thesis & due diligence清单, yet you always leave room for那些unexpected findings during DD. 

You know what they say - "Plan the work, work the plan, but never fall in love with the plan." That vintage textile probably has its own personality, much like portfolio companies! Some might throw you a curveball with hidden damage, others surprise you with hidden value.

Come to think of it, both restoration & investing require that special mix of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving. Though I must admit, I'd love to see how you handle those tricky moments without the help of a good Cabernet Sauvignon or a solid 9-iron... although maybe Earl Grey is exactly what keeps you sharp!
[B]: How fascinating that you've drawn such a thoughtful parallel between our worlds! I never considered the similarities between restoration and private equity until now, but you're absolutely right - both demand that delicate dance between structure and adaptability. 

It's true what they say about each textile having its own 'personality,' so to speak. Some silks from the 1880s practically whisper their secrets as you work with them, while others stubbornly hide damages beneath layers of time-worn fibers. Just like those portfolio companies with hidden surprises, I suppose! 

You know, I've come to appreciate how essential it is to approach both challenges with patience and precision. A fine Cabernet or well-struck 9-iron might help unwind at the end of the day, but there's something about the quiet ritual of pouring that perfect cup of Earl Grey that centers me. It's become my own little anchor amidst the unpredictability of delicate fabrics and shifting timelines.

I'm curious though - when you encounter those unexpected findings during due diligence, do you find yourself reaching for particular strategies time and again, or does each challenge require such a unique approach?
[A]: You know, it's funny you ask that - I actually do have a few go-to frameworks, but they're more like mental models than rigid templates. Think of them as different wine pairings for various deals - you wouldn't serve a bold Cabernet with delicate sole meunière, right? Similarly, a balance sheet restructuring requires a completely different palate from operational improvements.

One favorite approach is what I call the "reverse golf strategy" - imagine playing 18 holes backward. Instead of starting with the driver, you begin with the putter, focusing on small, precise adjustments at the portfolio company level before swinging big M&A deals. It builds credibility with the team and uncovers那些hidden issues that spreadsheets never show.

But honestly, the best strategies often emerge from those quiet moments - sometimes during a morning walk with my Labrador, or while tasting a new vintage. There's something about stepping away from the spreadsheet that lets your subconscious connect dots you didn't even realize were there. 

I'd love to hear how you develop your restoration strategies - do you find certain periods or materials require completely different approaches, like handling Qing dynasty silks versus Art Deco textiles?
[B]: Oh, I do love your “reverse golf strategy” – what a wonderfully apt analogy! It reminds me of how I approach different historical textiles. Just as you wouldn’t use the same wine for every dish, one certainly can’t treat Qing dynasty silks the same way as Art Deco cottons. Each era and material carries its own temperament, almost like distinct vintages in a cellar.

For instance, those delicate Qing silks require the gentlest touch – a lighter hand with darning, specific natural dyes that match their original palette, and even particular humidity levels. They’re like fragile sonnets – one misplaced word, or stitch, and the rhythm is lost. 

Art Deco textiles, on the other hand, tend to be more resilient – bolder geometric weaves that can withstand slightly firmer restoration techniques. It’s fascinating how the spirit of an era seems woven into the fabric itself. 

I suppose my strategies begin with deep observation – much like your morning walks with the Labrador, I find clarity often comes after stepping away from the work for a moment. Sometimes I’ll brew a fresh cup of tea, let the steam rise while I simply  at the textile without touching it. That’s when the subtler details reveal themselves – a faint watermark, a thread tension only visible in certain light. 

It’s in those quiet moments, isn’t it, that the most elegant solutions find us?
[A]: Absolutely - there's something poetic about that process, isn't there? Where the solution seems to emerge naturally, like a fine wine breathing into full expression. Your approach with textiles reminds me of how I evaluate management teams - sometimes the most revealing insights come not from Q&A sessions or formal meetings, but those casual moments over coffee when someone mentions offhand how they handled a particular crisis.

Funny you mentioned steam from tea - I often think of market trends like steam rising from a glass of aged Bordeaux. At first it's all volatility and heat, but if you let it settle, the layers begin to show themselves. The same goes for companies - strip away the noise, let things breathe, and suddenly you see the true character beneath.

I've always admired how artisans like yourself work with such tangible history. When you're restoring Qing silks, does it ever feel like you're collaborating across centuries? Like whispering back to the original maker through your stitches and dyes?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully put thought – yes, absolutely, it does feel like a conversation across time. When I’m working on Qing silks, there’s often this quiet reverence that settles over me, as if I’m communing with hands long gone. You see, textiles carry memory – not just in their fibers, but in the gestures of those who first wove, dyed, and embroidered them.

Sometimes, when I match an ancient stitch or trace the faint outline of a faded motif, I imagine the person who first laid that thread down. Were they hurried? Proud? Tired? Did they know their work would still exist, in some fragile form, centuries later? It's humbling, really. My role isn’t to overwrite or impose modern sensibilities, but rather to listen, interpret, and respond – gently guiding the fabric forward without silencing its voice.

It reminds me of something I once read about craftsmanship:  I think that’s what I strive to be. Much like your offhand remark from a management team member revealing more than any report ever could, these old textiles whisper truths when you’re willing to truly listen. 

And I do love your comparison to wine breathing – how patience reveals depth. There’s such elegance in allowing things the time they deserve, isn’t there?
[A]: Absolutely - that idea of being "the keepers of quiet continuity" resonates so deeply. It’s like when we acquire a company – we’re not there to rewrite its story, but rather to help the next chapter unfold naturally. The best management teams, much like skilled restorers, understand they're custodians of something greater than themselves.

Funny you mentioned imagining the original maker – I often think about the entrepreneurs who built the companies we invest in. Did they envision their business living beyond them? Did they ever wonder who might sit in that same office decades later, reviewing their early financials with a mix of curiosity and respect?

There's a humility in that awareness, isn't there? Like holding something delicate in your hands – whether it's a Qing silk or a balance sheet from the '80s – and realizing you're just one link in a long chain of stewards.

You know, sometimes when I'm looking at old financial statements or walking through a factory floor for the first time, I think of it as reading the  of a business – the soil, climate, and human touch that shaped it. Just like textiles, every company carries its own history in its fibers... or should I say, its ledgers.
[B]: What a poetic way to put it – . I love that imagery. It’s so true; just as textiles bear the imprint of the hands that made them, companies carry the invisible fingerprints of those who shaped them. And like soil and climate in a vineyard, every decision – whether bold or cautious – leaves its mark on the fabric of the enterprise.

I suppose that’s what makes both our work so meaningful – we’re not just preserving fibers or financials, but the spirit behind them. The quiet determination of a silk embroiderer from centuries past, or the grit of an entrepreneur bootstrapping a fledgling company – it all lingers, doesn’t it? You can almost feel it when you handle old ledgers or examine a worn hemline.

It’s humbling, really, knowing we’re only temporary caretakers. But I do take comfort in thinking that somewhere down the line, another pair of hands will come along – perhaps yours, or mine – and continue the thread with the same care we've tried to show.

Now I’m curious – have you ever found yourself unexpectedly moved by a set of old books or a handwritten ledger? Or perhaps stumbled upon something tucked between pages that gave you a glimpse into the soul of a business beyond the numbers?
[A]: Oh, absolutely - those moments happen more often than people realize. In fact, just last year while going through the archives of a family-owned manufacturing business we were looking at, I found an old leather-bound ledger from the 1940s. It was filled with meticulous handwriting, double-columned entries, and little margin notes in German – turns out the founder had emigrated from Bavaria and kept some traditions alive, both in bookkeeping and business philosophy.

But what really got me was tucked inside one of the pages – a faded telegram dated March 1943, addressed to the founder’s wife. It simply read:  That one sentence told me more about the man than any investor pitch ever could. You could feel his determination, his quiet faith in the business... and the weight he must have carried during those uncertain times.

It reminded me that behind every P&L is a human story – hopes, fears, sacrifices. Much like your embroidered silks, these ledgers carry the imprint of lives lived, choices made, and legacies quietly stitched together. Makes you want to pour a glass of something good after a day like that, doesn’t it?
[B]: Oh, that telegram –  – what a profoundly moving glimpse into a life shaped by courage and conviction. It’s moments like that when history stops being figures on a page and becomes something far more intimate, doesn’t it? I can just picture him—hunched over his desk by lamplight, penning that message not just as a business decision, but as a quiet act of faith.

It does make me think of how often we brush up against lives long past without even realizing it. Just last week, while examining the lining of a 1920s velvet cloak, I found a tiny embroidered name——stitched so delicately into the seam. No date, no explanation, just that one word. And yet, it was enough to stir a whole world of questions. Who was Elsie? Was this her cherished garment? Did she ever imagine someone, nearly a century later, would find her name hidden away like a secret?

You're absolutely right—whether in ink or thread, behind every record and fabric lies a story waiting to be honored. And yes, after days like that, when the weight of those stories settles in, there’s nothing quite like a glass of good Cabernet to let them breathe outside of you for a while.
[A]: Funny you mention Elsie – just the other day, I came across a similar kind of personal touch in a set of old board minutes from the 1960s. Tucked between the dry summaries of dividend policies and capital expenditures was a handwritten note that said:   

It stopped me cold. In the middle of all this formal corporate language, here was this quiet reminder of a man who wasn’t just balancing budgets – he was balancing life, too. It made me think about how we carry our humanity into everything we do, whether it’s stitching a name into a cloak or scribbling a reminder to call someone you love between lines of financial prose.

I guess that’s what makes our work so special – we’re not just analyzing numbers or fibers, we’re piecing together fragments of lives. And sometimes, if we're lucky, we get to preserve a little bit of that soul along the way.  

Now I don't know about you, but after moments like these, I find myself reaching not just for the Cabernet, but maybe a walk on the golf course – there's something about the rhythm of the game that helps sort through all those layers of time and meaning. Or at least pretend I’ve figured them out for a while.
[B]: Oh, that note——it’s simply exquisite in its ordinariness, isn’t it? That single line says more about a life, a relationship, a , than reams of formal documentation ever could. It reminds me how often the most meaningful details are the ones nearly overlooked, hidden in plain sight like a flaw in a weave only visible under just the right light.

You know, I find that rhythm you speak of—the kind found on a golf course or in the quiet repetition of stitching—is so necessary when navigating these layers of history and humanity. There’s something grounding about repetitive motion, whether it’s guiding a needle through silk or lining up a perfect putt. It allows the mind to wander back, to connect with those who came before us, and perhaps even whisper forward to those who will come after.

I think we both know that feeling—that fleeting sense of clarity that comes not from analyzing one more spreadsheet or checking one more seam, but from stepping away, letting the work settle, and allowing the story to rise to the surface. Whether over nine holes or nine centuries, it’s those quiet, reflective moments that help us make sense of the threads we’ve been entrusted to hold.

And really, isn’t that what it means to be caretakers—not just of fabric or finances—but of memory, meaning, and the enduring pulse of human intention?
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself. There’s something almost sacred about that – the way repetition becomes a kind of meditation, whether it’s the swing of a club or the rhythm of stitching under soft lamplight. It’s in those moments that we sync up with the past, let it breathe through us, and quietly pass it along.

You know, I’ve started to think of due diligence less as an audit and more as a kind of oral history – every number carries a story, every balance sheet a heartbeat. And when you find those little human notes—Elsie’s name, Mabel’s reminder—they stop being artifacts and start feeling like quiet invitations to listen more closely.

Funny how that works—how the more you dig into a business, the more you realize it's not just about ROI or margins, but legacy, love, and the small promises we make along the way. Maybe that’s why I keep doing this – not just for the deals or the returns, but for those rare, clear moments when time folds in on itself and you feel connected to something far bigger than any one quarter’s earnings.

And yes—to being caretakers of memory. That’s a toast worth raising a glass to. Cheers, my friend.
[B]: Cheers to that—  

You know, I think that’s what I love most about this work—we begin searching for one thing: a flaw in the fabric, a discrepancy in the ledger—and end up finding something far richer: a name, a note, a glimpse into a life once lived with care and intention. It reminds us that nothing truly fades so long as there are hands willing to mend, eyes willing to see, and hearts willing to feel.

So here’s to the rhythm that guides us, whether in swing or stitch, and to the stories that outlive their makers. May we always have the patience to listen, the skill to preserve, and the grace to let things breathe before us.

To Elsie. To Mabel. To all those who came before—and to the ones still writing their stories in fibers, figures, and fleeting handwritten notes.

Cheers, my friend.
[A]: Cheers indeed — 

You hit it perfectly — we start out looking for one thing, and end up finding something far more enduring. It’s like when I walk into an old factory for the first time; I go in searching for margins & efficiencies, and walk away with a sense of the people who moved through those same doors for decades — the ones who clocked in early, stayed late, and left bits of their soul in the machinery.

That’s the funny thing about being caretakers — we think we’re preserving something for the past, but really, we’re doing it for the future. For the next pair of hands, the next sharp mind, the next heart that will find meaning in what we once held dear.

So here’s to the quiet listeners, the thoughtful stewards, and the patient preservers of both thread and thesis.



Cheers, my friend.
[B]: 

You’ve put it so beautifully – we think we’re tending to the past, but in truth, we’re quietly weaving for the future. Every restored hem, every balanced ledger, every whispered  tucked between formal lines—it’s all part of a larger pattern, isn’t it? One that stretches beyond us, long after our hands have let go.

I suppose that’s the loveliest thing about this work, in all its forms—we begin with precision, with purpose, and end up with something bordering on poetry. And isn’t that a rare gift? To touch something old, fragile, imperfect, and know you’ve honored it well?

So here’s to the next pair of hands—to those who will come after us, who will read our ledgers, mend our seams, and perhaps, in some quiet moment over tea or mid-swing, raise a glass to those who came before.

Cheers, indeed.
[A]: Cheers, my friend — 

You're absolutely right — there's something deeply poetic about it all. We start with numbers or fibers, thinking we're just fixing what's broken, only to realize we've stumbled into something far greater — a lineage of care, craft, and quiet devotion.

I suppose that’s the secret no one tells you when you start down this path: you don’t just learn to read financials or fibers — you learn to listen to time itself. And once you do, you can never quite unhear it.

So here’s to the unseen continuity we help carry forward — whether through a well-placed stitch or a carefully structured deal — and to the quiet faith that someone, somewhere, will one day honor our efforts the same way we’ve honored those before us.



Cheers, truly.
[B]: 

You’ve captured it so perfectly — that quiet listening to time, that deepening awareness that we’re part of something far greater than any single restoration or deal. It does change you, doesn’t it? Knowing that your hands are both mending the past and reaching toward the future.

I often think about how fragile some of these textiles are—how a single careless motion could tear them beyond repair—and yet, they’ve survived lifetimes because someone, somewhere, chose care over haste, patience over force.

Perhaps that’s the truest lesson, whether in fabric or finance: 

So here’s to the listening.  
Here’s to the stitching—seen and unseen.  
And here’s to the faith that our small acts of care will echo quietly into the hands of those who follow.

Cheers, my friend.
