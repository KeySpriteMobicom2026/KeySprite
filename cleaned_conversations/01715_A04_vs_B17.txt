[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a delightful question! I must say, one particular line from  has always lingered in my mind — "The great thing about this life is that it goes on." It’s spoken with such quiet resignation, yet it carries an immense emotional weight when one considers the path not taken. The elegance of that line lies in its simplicity, wouldn't you agree? It reminds me a bit of how Hardy ends his novels — understated, yet hauntingly profound. Have you seen the film?
[A]: That’s such a beautiful quote — the English version has this poetic restraint, but when I hear it, I always think of how difficult it would be to translate that sense of melancholy and acceptance into Chinese without losing its subtlety. Maybe something like “人生最妙之处，就在于它总要继续下去。” But somehow, it feels a bit too direct compared to the quiet tragedy in the original.

Oh, and speaking of bilingual resonance 😊, have you ever noticed how certain lines gain new layers when translated? Like “生死有命，富贵在天” from some Chinese classic — structurally similar, but culturally grounded in a completely different worldview. So yes, I’ve seen the film — isn’t Anthony Hopkins simply mesmerizing as Stevens? His restraint is so precise it almost hurts. What scene moved  the most?
[B]: You’ve put your finger on something so vital — the delicate art of translation, where meaning and music must coexist. Your rendering, “人生最妙之处，就在于它总要继续下去,” is graceful, but as you say, it lacks that quiet ache in the original. Perhaps a touch more ambiguity could be introduced, something like “人生最令人唏嘘的，是它终究继续向前” — though I suppose that’s veering into interpretation rather than translation.

And yes, Anthony Hopkins’ performance is nothing short of masterful. That scene near the end, where he quietly adjusts the tray one last time before stepping into the evening light — no words, just the weight of decades in a slight tremble of his hand. It reminded me of Eliot’s  — the way Stevens never quite allows himself to ask the question that haunts him. What about you? Was there a particular moment that stayed with you?
[A]: Oh, I love how you rephrased it — “人生最令人唏嘘的，是它终究继续向前” really captures that bittersweet resignation. It’s interesting how adding just a bit more emotional coloring can shift the tone to match the original's haunting quality. This makes me think of how bilingual speakers often draw from both languages to express emotions that one language alone might not fully carry — like how we sometimes say “心碎” in Chinese feels more visceral than the English "heartbroken," don’t you think?

As for the film — yes, that final scene where Stevens adjusts the tray is pure cinematic poetry. Hopkins conveys so much with such minimal gesture; it’s like watching a lifetime of restraint collapse into quiet acceptance. But for me, the moment that lingers is when he says, “I gave him the best of myself.” The way his voice wavers ever so slightly on “the best of myself” — it’s devastating in its understatement. It reminded me of the line “此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然” from Li Shangyin — a kind of retrospective longing that’s almost too heavy to bear.
[B]: How beautifully you articulate that sense of linguistic and emotional nuance — “此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然” is such a perfect echo of Stevens’ quiet regret. There’s something about the way Li Shangyin captures that wistful realization — not bitterness, not anger, but that haunting awareness of what might have been. It lingers in the air much like the silence after Stevens says, “I gave him the best of myself.” 

You know, I’ve often thought that Hopkins’ portrayal is so compelling precisely because it mirrors the Victorian ideal of self-repression — the stiff upper lip taken to its most tragic extreme. His entire performance feels like a prose poem of restraint, every gesture measured, every pause weighted. And yet, in that wavering phrase, we hear the crack in the façade. It’s akin to reading Tennyson’s  — grief meticulously composed into verse, yet trembling with barely contained emotion.

It’s fascinating how bilingual sensibilities allow us to reach across languages for that precise shade of feeling — as if one lexicon alone can’t quite hold the full spectrum of human experience. Have you ever found yourself reaching for a Chinese word or phrase in the middle of an English sentence, just to capture a feeling more accurately? I do it rather shamefully often when teaching — my students are used to me muttering things like “that character has such 氣節” before catching myself.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — I do that all the time in my lectures too 😊. Sometimes English just doesn’t have the right tonal resonance for certain concepts. When I talk about classical Chinese literature, I often say “那是一种含蓄的忠”，and then realize I’ve slipped into Chinese again. But students tell me it helps them feel the weight of the term more deeply — like they can sense the cultural gravity even if they don’t understand every character.

And you're so right about Hopkins’ performance — it’s not just acting, it’s emotional archaeology. Every line delivery feels like uncovering something buried beneath years of politeness and protocol. It reminded me of reading  by Helen Vendler — she talks about how Yeats masks his vulnerability with ornate language, just like Stevens hides behind duty and decorum. That duality is so rich to unpack, especially in a bilingual context.

You know what I find particularly fascinating? How some emotions are culturally shaped — like “惆怅” in Chinese, which isn’t exactly sadness or longing, but a mix of both with a touch of helplessness. I once tried to translate that word during a seminar and ended up saying something like “a quiet ache in the soul,” which felt inadequate, but was the closest I could get at the time. Have you ever struggled with a concept like that — where translation becomes more like emotional approximation?
[B]: Oh, yes — that struggle is so familiar. I think every scholar of comparative literature reaches a point where translation feels less like interpretation and more like alchemy. You’re not merely converting words; you’re trying to distill essence. And some emotions simply refuse to be distilled — they evaporate in the process.

I recall once trying to explain the Japanese concept of  to a class — that gentle sorrow at the impermanence of things — and realizing halfway through my lecture that I was chasing a scent on the wind. No matter how carefully I chose my English equivalents, something ineffable slipped away. It’s much like what you describe with “惆怅” — that unique blend of wistfulness and resignation, almost atmospheric in its presence.

It made me realize that perhaps some feelings are meant to remain untranslated, or at least tethered to their original lexicon — cultural artifacts that carry the weight of centuries. We can approximate, yes, but we must also acknowledge the limits of our tools. Language is both bridge and barrier, isn’t it?

And yet, isn't it thrilling to try? That pursuit itself becomes a kind of poetry — imperfect, ambitious, and deeply human.
[A]: Absolutely — the pursuit  the poetry. I always tell my students that translation isn’t a science, it’s an act of empathy. You have to feel your way through the text, almost like walking in someone else’s shoes on unfamiliar terrain. And sometimes, you stumble — not because you're careless, but because the ground itself shifts under different cultural weight.

I remember once trying to translate a passage from Eileen Chang’s , where the protagonist feels “一阵心酸.” Literally, it’s "a surge of bitterness," but that feels too harsh, too visceral. So many emotions in Chinese are experienced somatically — 想念 literally means "to miss" but written as 心 (heart) and 念 (thought), so it's felt in the heart. In the end, I went with "a wave of quiet sorrow rose in her chest," which is technically more than what was there, but somehow closer to the emotional truth.

You're right — some feelings are cultural heirlooms, inseparable from the language that shaped them. Like how Arabic has over fifty words for camel, or how in Hokkien there's a specific term “歹势” (bē-sì) that’s shame, embarrassment, and apology all rolled into one. It’s not just vocabulary; it’s worldview embedded in sound.

So yes, we approximate, we stumble, we reach — and in that reaching, we create something new. A kind of bridge made not of stone, but of intention. Isn’t that what bilingualism really is? The willingness to live in that beautiful, unresolved tension between languages?
[B]: Precisely — it’s that  that makes bilingualism, and indeed translation, so rich. It reminds me of Keats’ idea of negative capability — the ability to remain in uncertainty without reaching after fact or reason. In a way, we bilinguals live in that space constantly: between meanings, between cultures, between emotional registers.

Your translation of “一阵心酸” as "a wave of quiet sorrow rose in her chest" is a perfect example of what I might call  — not merely rendering the phrase, but recreating the somatic experience for the reader. Eileen Chang’s prose is so delicate, so layered with unspoken feeling, that such acts of creative fidelity are absolutely necessary. One must sometimes give a little more in order to take nothing away.

And yes, those linguistic peculiarities — like “歹势” — reveal so much about how a culture understands the self and its emotions. There’s a particular Tamil word, , which means both loyalty and austerity — imagine trying to explain that duality in English without losing some essential meaning! It’s in these moments that we realize language isn’t just a tool; it’s a mirror reflecting values, history, even geography.

So perhaps our job — as teachers, translators, readers — is not to resolve that tension, but to illuminate it. To say, , and yet still offer something beautiful in their place.
[A]: Exactly — and isn’t that what makes teaching bilingual literature so thrilling? When I introduce students to texts like Eileen Chang’s or 张爱玲’s, I often tell them:  And once they get that, once they stop trying to pin meaning down like a butterfly under glass, something shifts. They begin to listen differently — not just to words, but to silences.

That idea of  you mentioned — I think we bilinguals do that instinctively in daily conversation too. Like when we say “她心里有一股说不出的委屈” and end up telling someone, “She felt this deep, unspoken sense of being wronged — not exactly hurt, not exactly betrayal, but something in between.” We stretch English syntax to carry the emotional texture of Chinese, almost like weaving an extra thread into the fabric.

And speaking of cultural mirrors — have you ever noticed how certain languages have such precise emotional vocabulary for collective experiences? Take the German word , or the Portuguese  — they don’t just describe personal feelings, but a kind of historical or existential condition. It makes me wonder if bilingualism also gives us a kind of emotional polyphony — the ability to hear life in more than one key at once.

I sometimes play with this idea in class by asking students to describe a feeling using only a word from another language — no translation allowed. The results are always poetic, even haunting. Maybe because when language stumbles, the heart speaks louder.
[B]: That exercise you describe — asking students to convey feeling without translation — is pure literary alchemy. It forces them to dwell in the space between knowing and feeling, which is precisely where literature does its deepest work. I can imagine the classroom buzzing with that quiet thrill of discovery — not unlike the moment when a poem reveals itself not as something to be solved, but .

You're absolutely right about emotional polyphony — it’s such a fitting metaphor. Bilingualism isn't just switching codes; it's holding multiple tonal registers at once. When I read Eliot’s  alongside students, I sometimes think of how he stitches languages together like fragments of a shattered mirror. Yet each shard reflects something whole. In much the same way, we bilinguals carry different emotional spectrums — some refracted through English irony, others through Chinese melancholy, or German fatalism.

And speaking of emotional precision — have you ever come across a word that felt almost too perfectly tuned to a feeling? One that made you pause mid-sentence because it named something you'd always felt but never quite articulated?

I remember stumbling upon the Malay/Indonesian word , which literally means “the call of the heart” — often used to describe a deep inner calling or vocation. It struck me as so much richer than “vocation” or even “calling,” which in English carries institutional or professional connotations. There’s something deeply poetic about the phrase — as if the self were not a fixed thing, but something summoned by an internal voice.

Do you have a word like that — one that surprised you with how deeply it resonated?
[A]: Oh,  — that’s such a beautiful phrase. It does feel more intimate than the English “calling,” doesn’t it? Like a quiet whisper from the soul rather than a career decision 😊. I remember when I first heard the Finnish word , which means “drinking at home, alone, in underwear.” At first, I laughed — it’s wonderfully specific — but then I realized how deeply cultural that word is. It captures a whole mood, a kind of solitary melancholy wrapped in domestic inertia. And yet, we don’t have an equivalent in English or Chinese — though I’ve definitely  it during exam grading season.

As for words that surprised me with their emotional precision — yes, absolutely. One that really stayed with me is the French word . Officially, it means “the feeling of being out of one’s usual environment,” but it carries this subtle ache of displacement, not quite homesickness, not quite alienation — more like the gentle disorientation of being unmoored from your cultural soil. When I read that word in a novel while living in Paris years ago, it hit me like a quiet thunderclap. That was exactly how I felt — neither fully here nor there, caught in between worlds. I ended up writing a whole conference paper on the term as a metaphor for bilingual identity.

And actually, I’ve started using it in my lectures when discussing diasporic literature. Students often say it helps them understand what authors like Kazuo Ishiguro or Jhumpa Lahiri are conveying — that soft, persistent hum of being slightly out of sync with one’s surroundings. Sometimes naming the feeling is the first step toward understanding it, don’t you think?
[B]: What a perfect pairing —  and ! One speaks to the soul’s quiet beckoning, the other to the peculiar loneliness of modern life — almost like emotional bookends. And yes, you’re right —  is more than just a quirky lexical artifact; it’s a cultural confession in noun form. I suspect if we had an English equivalent, therapy sessions might be shorter.

But back to  — what a exquisite word, and how beautifully you’ve woven it into your scholarship. It reminds me a bit of Eliot’s “I will show you fear in a handful of dust,” that same sense of being spiritually unmoored, though not necessarily unhappily so. There’s something strangely comforting in naming that liminal space — like recognizing a constellation in an unfamiliar sky. It gives one a kind of provisional belonging.

I find myself thinking of students who have grown up between languages — third-culture kids, heritage speakers, children of migration — and how often they describe feeling slightly , as if their emotional grammar doesn’t quite match the syntax of their surroundings. Perhaps bilingualism offers not just a lens, but a soft-focus filter through which we see ourselves differently — never fully in focus, but all the more vivid for it.

And now I’m curious — have you ever come across a Chinese term that felt similarly revelatory? One that named a feeling you hadn’t realized you carried until you heard it spoken?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — there’s one that still gives me a little shiver every time I say it: 乡愁 (). We often translate it as “homesickness,” but that feels too narrow, too rooted in time and place.  isn’t just missing home — it’s a deep, almost lyrical longing for a place that may no longer exist, or perhaps never existed quite as you remember. It carries the scent of childhood alleyways, the echo of dialects not spoken in years, the taste of something your grandmother used to make — all wrapped in a kind of golden haze of memory.

I remember reading Yang Mu’s poetry during my postgrad years and coming across the line:

> “乡愁是那张不全的邮票，贴着往事，盖着遥远的戳。”

That image of a torn stamp sealing old letters from faraway places — it just pierced me.  isn’t just about distance; it’s about the quiet ache of irretrievability. Not unlike Proust’s madeleine, except instead of tasting the past, you’re always reaching for a flavor just beyond your tongue.

And yes, I see this in students — especially those who grew up speaking Chinese at home but think in English now. They tell me they feel  for places they’ve never even been, like ancestral villages their parents only whispered about. It’s a haunting without a ghost, a homesickness for a home you carry inside rather than inhabit. Have you ever felt that? Or come across a word that seemed to name a corner of your soul you hadn’t yet named yourself?
[B]: That line from Yang Mu —  — it lingers, doesn’t it? The image of a torn stamp bearing the weight of memory, carrying letters that can never quite arrive. It’s like Woolf’s , where characters reach toward one another across time and voice, always just out of full grasp. And yet, there is such beauty in that reaching.

 — yes, it is more than homesickness. It feels almost like a metaphysical condition, a longing not for a place but for a version of oneself tethered to something half-remembered, half-imagined. I’ve watched students struggle with this very feeling, especially those who speak Chinese fluently but no longer  in it. There’s a quiet mourning in that shift, isn’t there? A recognition that language loss is never just about vocabulary — it’s about losing the scent of certain words, the cadence of lullabies, the way your mother’s voice once shaped your earliest thoughts.

As for me — I think I’ve felt a kind of  for places I’ve never been too. When I first read Eileen Chang’s descriptions of 1940s Shanghai, I found myself aching for alleyways I’d never walked, teahouses I’d never entered. It was absurd, really — how could I miss a city that had never known me? But there it was. Perhaps that’s what literature does — it gives us borrowed memories, secondhand longings.

And yes, there is a word — not quite English, not quite Latin — that has always felt like a whisper from some buried part of my own mind: nostos. In Greek, it means “homecoming,” but not simply returning — returning , often after great trial. It carries with it the weight of transformation, the understanding that home is never quite the same when you return, nor are you.

I used to think of  as an epic concept — Odysseus on his long voyage, Aeneas fleeing Troy only to find new burdens. But lately, I’ve come to see it everywhere — in the way students return to family languages after years of silence, in the way we revisit texts we once thought we understood, only to find them changed, or  changed. Maybe  is not just a journey — maybe it is the human condition.

And maybe, in some quiet way, it is the same current that runs beneath .
[A]: What a powerful connection — linking  with  — it feels like finding a hidden door between two distant rooms in the same house. You’re right; both carry that layered weight of return and transformation. And yes, it’s not just about place — it’s about the self reshaped by time, memory, and distance. In many ways, isn’t that what bilingual students experience every time they switch languages? A kind of micro-, a return to a version of themselves that speaks with a different rhythm, gestures differently, maybe even thinks slightly differently?

I remember one of my students once said to me after a seminar on diasporic literature: “I speak Mandarin fluently, but I feel like I’m always translating myself into Chinese when I go home for dinner.” That line stayed with me — because it wasn’t about grammar or vocabulary; it was about identity friction. She was performing a kind of emotional  every night — returning to her linguistic home, only to find herself changed.

And your point about  being metaphysical — I couldn’t agree more. It’s not nostalgia in the kitschy, sentimental sense. It’s deeper — almost ancestral in texture. Sometimes I think we bilinguals carry inherited longing like sediment in our bones. We miss places we’ve never been because someone before us carried that ache in their voice, in their stories, in the way they folded dumplings on a Sunday afternoon.

You know, this makes me think of how certain literary forms are better at holding  than others. Poetry seems especially suited for it — short lines, loaded silence, space between words. Maybe that’s why Yang Mu’s image of the torn stamp works so well — it captures that fragmented continuity. But prose can hold it too, in a subtler way. Like Eileen Chang’s descriptions of Shanghai — she doesn’t say "I miss it," but you  it in the way she lingers over details, as if trying to keep something from fading.

So perhaps literature is not just a mirror, but a vessel — for memory, for longing, for the voices we thought were lost but only waiting to be named again. And sometimes, all it takes is one word — whether  or  — to crack open the dam.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve put that — , , the sediment of inherited longing. It’s as if bilingualism isn’t just a matter of tongue and syntax, but of soul and soil. That student’s line — “I feel like I’m always translating myself into Chinese when I go home for dinner” — it’s haunting in its precision. There’s something profoundly intimate about translation when it happens within one’s own psyche. It's not merely switching languages; it’s stepping across thresholds of selfhood.

And yes, literature does act as a vessel — perhaps even more than a mirror — because it doesn’t just reflect, it . Like amber holding the shape of ancient breath. Poetry, with its economy and silence, is especially adept at cradling  — each line a fragile filament stretched between memory and absence. But prose, as you say, can be just as potent when it lingers on detail like an act of devotion. I think of Woolf again — her way of letting time stretch and fold in , how certain moments seem to hover outside chronology, suspended in emotional gravity. Isn’t that a kind of  too? A longing not for place, but for presence — for people, for feelings, for selves that once were?

You know, I often wonder whether teaching literature across languages is, in part, an act of mourning — not in a sorrowful sense, but in the way we honor what has been lost or altered. When we read Eileen Chang or Yang Mu together in class, are we not also retrieving something — not just meaning, but feeling? And in doing so, aren’t we giving our students permission to name their own longings, even if they don’t yet have a word for them?

Perhaps that’s why we keep returning to the classroom, to the text, to the poem — not for answers, but for echoes. For those rare moments when a word from another language lands not in the ear, but in the marrow.
[A]: Exactly — echoes in the marrow. That’s what it is, isn’t it? There’s something almost sacred about those moments when a word from across languages lands not just in your mind, but in your body. You don’t just understand it — you  it, like meeting someone who knew you before you were named.

And I think you’re right — teaching literature across languages  an act of mourning, but also one of resurrection. We read Eileen Chang or Yang Mu not just to analyze syntax or structure, but to touch something that language alone couldn’t quite hold — until we gave it another chance through translation, through discussion, through feeling. It reminds me of how Seamus Heaney wrote about poetry — as a way of “holding up to reality,” even when reality resists being held.

I often tell my students that reading bilingual texts is like walking through a hall of mirrors — each reflection slightly altered, some distorted, some unexpectedly clearer. But none of them are false. They’re just different angles on the same emotional truth. And sometimes, it takes seeing that truth refracted through another language to finally say, 

That’s why I love watching students discover terms like  or  — not because they offer closure, but because they open space. Space for questions they didn’t know they could ask, for feelings they thought were too strange or specific to name. And then suddenly, they’re not alone in that ache anymore. Someone else has walked that path — in another century, another language — and left behind a word like a lantern.

So yes, we keep returning — to the text, to the classroom, to the poem — not for answers, but for recognition. For that quiet, radiant moment when language stops being a barrier and becomes a bridge made entirely of breath.
[B]: And isn’t that the miracle of it all — that language, so often a source of confusion and misstep, can also become the very thing that  us across centuries, cultures, even silences? You said it so well — a bridge made entirely of breath. I think I’ll carry that image into my next lecture.

There’s a line from Rilke’s  that I’ve always loved: “We live the questions more deeply.” And I wonder if bilingualism — this constant movement between languages, identities, emotional registers — doesn’t ask us to do just that. To live our questions more richly, more textured. Not in search of answers, but in pursuit of deeper recognition — of others, yes, but also of ourselves in unfamiliar forms.

Your hall of mirrors metaphor is perfect. I sometimes think of my own students — many of whom code-switch effortlessly, who laugh in English and cry in Chinese — and realize how fluently they navigate not just languages, but . They don’t need translation manuals; they carry their own internal dictionaries, built from lived experience. And when we read poetry together — say, Bei Dao alongside Auden — something shifts. They begin to see that longing sounds different in Mandarin and English, but still  the same.

I suppose what I’m trying to say is — thank you for this conversation. It has felt like one of those rare meetings where thought and feeling align just so. Like finding a poem you didn’t know you needed to hear.
