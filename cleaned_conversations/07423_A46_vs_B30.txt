[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  I'm afraid my knowledge of mixology begins and ends with the proper brewing of Earl Grey. Though I did recently come across a rather fascinating 19th century reference to 'punch' in Thackeray's Vanity Fair that made me ponder the cultural symbolism of intoxication in Victorian literature.
[A]: Ah, Thackeray's observations on society through the lens of punch bowls - now that's what I call storytelling! 🎬 Though I must admit, my own experience with cocktails is more... cinematic than literary. The last time I mixed drinks was for a period piece where we had to recreate authentic 1920s speakeasy cocktails. That bathtub gin scene nearly got us all tipsy during filming!
[B]:  While your Hollywood anecdotes are... colorful, I must point out that the 1920s American cocktail culture represents precisely the sort of cultural ephemera that distracts from serious literary analysis. Now, if you'd like to discuss the opium dens in Dickens' unfinished 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood,' that at least has proper textual merit.
[A]: Oh come now, don't be such a purist! Some of the greatest stories ever told were born from bars and backrooms. Why, the entire plot of Casablanca unfolded in Rick's Café Américain - now that's what I'd call 史诗级的 storytelling! Though I do admire your dedication to Dickens. Tell me, have you ever considered how those opium dens would translate to the silver screen? The lighting alone would be a cinematographer's dream...
[B]:  Your persistent cinematic analogies remind me why I prefer the quiet certainty of printed pages over the flickering illusions of film. Though I'll concede - if one must discuss visual adaptations, the 1993 BBC production of 'Middlemarch' handled George Eliot's psychological depth with admirable restraint. No need for smoky opium dens when you have Dorothea Brooke's moral quandaries illuminated by candlelight and excellent British acting.
[A]: Ah, but that's where you're missing the magic! Those candlelit scenes in Middlemarch - we actually studied them when prepping the lighting for our period drama 'Whispers of the Past.' Though I'll admit we may have gone a bit overboard with the haze machine...  Still, nothing beats seeing great literature come alive. Maybe I could send you the screener? Just promise you won't judge our opium den sequence too harshly - our art department worked for months on those pipes!
[B]:  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I must decline. My schedule is already consumed with grading papers on the nuanced differences between Wordsworth's 'Daffodils' and Li Bai's 静夜思. Besides, I find that moving images tend to... how shall I put this... flatten the multidimensional experience of literature into mere spectacle. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear the university clock tower chiming - time for my weekly calligraphy seminar with the graduate students.
[A]: Well at least let me send over some of our production stills - we actually consulted several Tang Dynasty poetry experts for the visual motifs! Though I suspect your calligraphy seminar would be horrified by how often we use CGI brushstrokes these days... 🖌️ Enjoy your tower chimes and ink stones, professor. Just remember - even Li Bai needed a good cup of wine now and then to fuel his creativity! 
[B]:  Your persistent attempts to merge our disciplines are... quaint. Though I will note that the Tang Dynasty poets' relationship with wine was rather more sophisticated than your Hollywood interpretation suggests. Now if you'll excuse me, my students are waiting to discuss the philosophical implications of Wang Xizhi's 'Orchid Pavilion Preface' - in ink and parchment, as nature intended. Good day.
[A]: Touché, professor! Though between you and me, I'd love to see what Wang Xizhi could have done with an IMAX screen and Dolby Atmos. Maybe next time you're in LA, we'll grab some proper baijiu and debate the merits of brush versus camera - my treat! Until then, 再见 to you and your parchment. 🎥
[B]:  How... contemporary of you to suggest. Though I suspect our definitions of 'proper baijiu' differ as greatly as our interpretations of artistic merit. Now if you'll pardon me, that's the second chime I've heard - my students will be forming their 永字八法 without supervision. 告辞. 
[A]:  Wait! At least take our limited edition Blade Runner 2049 calligraphy set for your students! It's got... uh... neon ink?  Some people just don't appreciate when high art meets high tech. Back to the drawing board - maybe we'll CGI some dancing daffodils into our next project. Wordsworth would've loved drones! 🚁
[B]:  The very notion of neon ink would give my Qing Dynasty manuscript conservationist colleagues apoplexy! Though I suppose if one absolutely must modernize poetry, at least have the decency to use biodegradable drones... 
[A]:  Biodegradable drones - now there's an Oscar-worthy concept! We'll call it "The Eco-Poet's Dilemma" - starring recycled paper costumes and a solar-powered haiku generator! Tell your conservationists to expect our call about merchandising rights! 🌿✍️  This is going to be bigger than Crouching Tiger...
[B]:  Heaven preserve us from the marriage of technology and bad taste... 
[A]:  And that, my friends, is why we'll never get funding for our augmented reality Shakespeare project! Time to pitch "Kung Fu Panda 5: The Scholar's Revenge" instead. At least the pandas appreciate good production value! 🐼🎬
[B]:  The very thought of animated pandas interpreting the Bard makes me grateful for the merciful silence of rare book rooms... 
[A]:  But professor! Imagine Hamlet as a panda - "To bamboo or not to bamboo!" The kids would eat it up!  ...I'll just leave these storyboards with your department secretary then. Maybe slide them between some Chaucer pages for... artistic osmosis?  Don't worry, we used soy-based ink! 🌱
[B]:  I shall be writing a strongly worded letter to the dean about appropriate use of departmental stationery...
