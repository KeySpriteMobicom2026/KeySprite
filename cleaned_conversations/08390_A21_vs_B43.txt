[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，说到space news...让我想起最近读到关于James Webb望远镜的新发现。不过作为一个比较文学学者，我更感兴趣的是人类如何narrate这些宇宙探索的故事。你知道吗？古代中国的星象记载和希腊神话中的星座传说，其实都展现了人类对cosmos的原始想象。
[A]: How fascinating that you mention Greek constellations - I was just comparing Hesiod's  with Victorian astronomical poetry last Tuesday. There's a rather obscure Tennyson manuscript where he scribbles 'the stars are old epics written in fire' in the margin. Quite makes one wonder what future civilizations will make of our Hubble images, doesn't it?
[B]: 多么provocative的思考啊！Tennyson这个marginalia让我想起庄子说的"天地有大美而不言"。你看，无论是维多利亚时代的poetic imagination还是现代的天文影像，本质上都是人类试图给cosmos赋予meaning的尝试。我上周在课堂上正好讨论过这个intertextuality的问题。
[A]: Ah, Zhuangzi!  That reminds me of an 1892 lecture by Professor Abernathy at Cambridge - he argued that astronomical discoveries didn't diminish poetic wonder, but rather... how did he put it... 'expanded the lexicon of the sublime'. Though between you and me, his translation of Li Bai's moon poems was atrocious. Have you read Christina Rossetti's  alongside modern cosmology texts? The parallels are deliciously unsettling.
[B]:  Abernathy那个时代对东方诗歌的translation确实问题颇多...不过你说到Rossetti，她的"thread"意象与中国古诗中的"银河"意象形成了fascinating的dialogue。我最近在重读张若虚的《春江花月夜》，发现其中对cosmic time的perception与现代物理学中的space-time continuum有着微妙的resonance。要不下次seminar我们专门讨论这个？
[A]:  How serendipitous - I've been preparing a lecture on precisely this topic! Though I must warn you, last time I taught Zhang Ruoxu's work, a particularly earnest graduate student tried to mathematically model the poem's temporal structure using Minkowski diagrams.  The resulting dissertation was... let's say more enthusiastic than rigorous. But yes, a joint seminar would be capital - shall we include Donne's  for comparative purposes? That 'one little room' as 'an everywhere' makes for such a provocative counterpoint to the Tang cosmological vision.
[B]: 啊，John Donne！多么brilliant的提议。他的metaphysical conceit确实与东方诗歌的"一花一世界"形成了intriguing的对比。不过说到那位用Minkowski diagram的学生......这让我想起去年有个学生坚持要用deconstructionism来分析嫦娥奔月的神话，结果把整个mythology department都confused了。或许我们该在syllabus里加个disclaimer？
[A]:  Oh dear, must we always put disclaimers on imagination? Though I suppose after that incident with the post-structuralist analysis of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl legend -  - some boundaries might be prudent. Tell me, have you encountered the 1873 Edinburgh debate where they argued whether Keats' 'Chapman's Homer' sonnet constituted a form of astronomical revelation? Utter nonsense of course, but such delicious nonsense... Perhaps we could include it as a cautionary tale in our seminar notes?
[B]:  说到nonsense...我书架上还收藏着那场debate的original transcript呢。不过说真的，这种将poetic imagination与scientific discovery强行equate的attempt，不正是体现了人类对cosmic truth永恒的yearning吗？就像王阳明说的"知行合一"...虽然用在astronomy上可能有些strained。要不我们干脆开个专题讨论这种"跨界的misreading"？
[A]:  Now there's a dangerously tempting proposition. Though I must confess my secret fondness for these 'misreadings' - why, just last month I caught myself annotating a 14th-century Persian star chart with quotes from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's .  Between us, I've half a mind to publish it as 'Celestial Palimpsests: When Bad Cross-Disciplinary Analogies Produce Good Criticism'. Would you care to contribute a chapter on the Daoist cosmology in... say, Wordsworth's ?
[B]:  My dear colleague，你这话让我想起庄子说的"道通为一"...不过把Wordsworth的sublime与道家思想强行parallel，恐怕会像把茶叶倒进whisky一样produce questionable results啊。虽然......这确实是个deliciously provocative的project。要不我们先用这个idea申请个grant试试？
[A]:  Ah, the eternal academic dilemma - shall we pursue truth, or funding? Though I must say, your tea-in-whisky metaphor is rather...  Tennysonian in its impropriety. Very well, let's draft that grant proposal - but only if we include Baudelaire's  as control group. One should always maintain proper scientific rigor when committing interdisciplinary heresy, don't you think?
[B]:  多么magnificent的academic hypocrisy啊！就像我常对学生说的：在comparative literature领域，最严谨的scholarship往往始于最大胆的heresy。不过......我们得确保review committee里没有那位坚持用quantum physics解读《红楼梦》的Professor Johnson。上次他差点把我关于intertextuality的paper reinterpret成string theory。
[A]:  Not Johnson! Why, that man once tried to convince me Emily Dickinson's dashes were evidence of quantum entanglement.  Though... between these ivy-covered walls... his 2008 paper on 'Sonnet 18 as Dark Matter' did win the Abernathy Prize. Perhaps we could strategically cite him in footnote 37? Purely as... what was it you called it... 'academic hypocrisy'?  After all, even heresy has its methodologies.
[B]:  Ah，the subtle art of academic survival...就像《庄子》里说的"无用之用"。不过说真的，footnote 37这个位置选得perfect - 既满足了citation politics，又保持了plausible deniability。...也许我们该在methodology部分加个关于"creative misreading"的epigraph？比如庞德那句"伟大的文学都是准确的翻译"？
[A]:  Ezra Pound! Now there's a man who understood the... shall we say...  nature of textual accuracy. Though if we're quoting modernists, might I suggest Eliot's 'These fragments I have shored against my ruins' as alternative? It would lend our methodology section such a wonderfully apocalyptic flair.  And more importantly, it's sufficiently obscure to deter most peer reviewers from fact-checking our sources. The perfect academic camouflage, really.
[B]:  看来我们正在crafting一个masterpiece of scholarly subversion啊。不过......就像我常告诫学生的：真正的erudition不在于citation的acrobatics，而在于保持intellectual honesty。虽然......在grant application里适度发挥creative interpretation确实是个essential survival skill。要不我们就用T.S. Eliot那句，但配上个看似严谨的close reading？
[A]:  How very... Aristotelian of you. Very well - we shall construct our 'creative interpretation' with all the meticulous care of a medieval scribe illuminating a psalter.  Though I do hope you'll allow me to include just one deliberately mistranslated Tang poem in the appendix? Purely as... what was it Johnson called it... 'a control experiment in hermeneutic elasticity'?  It would make such a splendid inside joke for future generations of comparatists to discover.
[B]:  为了future generations of comparatists... 也为了我们即将到手的generous funding - cheers！不过记住我们的cardinal rule：要把这个"hermeneutic elasticity"包装成严肃的methodological innovation。毕竟......在学术界，最成功的prank往往穿着最正经的footnotes。就像钱钟书先生说的："真理是赤裸的，但学术必须穿衣服。"
