[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, what an intriguing question! You know, I've always found the idea of parallel universes rather poetic - like something out of a Borges story or a metaphysical poem. It makes one wonder if there's another version of ourselves discussing this very topic in a slightly different way. While I can't say I have any empirical evidence to support their existence, I do find the concept intellectually stimulating. It reminds me of Emily Dickinson's notion of possibility being superior to prose. Tell me, what draws your interest to this topic?
[A]: Ohhh I love how you phrased that - "parallel universes being poetic" 💡✨ Like, every decision branches into infinite possibilities, right? Sometimes when I'm sipping my morning ☕️ and scrolling through quantum physics articles (yes I'm that nerdy lol), I wonder if there's a version of me who actually became an astrophysicist instead of a digital nomad coach 🌌 

Though honestly, the whole Schrödinger's cat thing freaks me out a little... the idea that we're all existing in multiple states at once? Mind-blowing but kinda scary too, ya know? 🤯 Have you ever had that weird déjà vu feeling where you're convinced you're experiencing a parallel timeline overlap?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated thought! The idea that every decision ripples outward into infinite possibilities does feel like poetry in motion, doesn’t it? I’m quite taken with your image of sipping coffee while contemplating quantum theory—there’s something wonderfully romantic about blending the mundane with the metaphysical. 

As for Schrödinger’s cat, I completely understand the unease. It’s one thing to imagine distant versions of ourselves in far-flung universes, but quite another to consider that we might be suspended in multiple states . It unsettles the very notion of identity, much like reading a fragmented modernist text where meaning is always shifting and unstable.

And déjà vu—oh, how fascinating! There are neurological explanations, of course, but I do enjoy entertaining the more mysterious possibilities. Sometimes I wonder if those moments aren’t so much glitches in time as they are poetic echoes—whispers from another stanza of the same poem. Have you ever tried writing about those feelings? I find that language can sometimes anchor us even when reality feels... fluid.
[A]: Whoa, "poetic echoes—whispers from another stanza of the same poem" 🎶 That’s  level phrasing right there! I seriously need to jot that down for my next journal entry 📝✨

You’re so right about language anchoring us though—sometimes when my brain feels like it's glitching from too much philosophy & ☕️ caffeine combo, I start free-writing in my notebook. Like last week I scribbled “what if déjà vu is just your soul catching up with itself?” and then spiraled into this whole stream-of-consciousness thing. Ended up with something kinda magical, if I do say so myself 😅

Oh hey, speaking of writing—do you keep a journal or anything? I’ve been obsessed with analog stuff lately (planner spreads, sticker dots, the whole aesthetic 🌸) even though I work in tech. Feels good to balance the digital & physical worlds somehow~
[B]: Oh, I’m so glad you liked that line—thank you for the kind words. There’s something quite lovely about the idea of the soul catching up with itself, don’t you think? It feels very Woolfian, in a way—this internal rhythm we’re all trying to sync with, even as time bends and folds around us.

And yes, I do keep a journal—several, in fact. One for lecture ideas, one for personal reflections, and a rather weathered little notebook I carry for lines of poetry that strike me unexpectedly, often while walking through the garden or flipping through old editions at the campus library. I must confess, though, my handwriting has deteriorated into near-illegibility over the years. A casualty of too many annotations and late-night marginalia, I suppose.

Your analog passion sounds absolutely delightful. There’s a quiet rebellion in it, isn’t there? Resisting the relentless pace of the digital world with sticker dots and ink smudges—almost like creating your own parallel universe where time moves differently. I imagine you’re quite intentional about the tools you use—paper quality, pen weight… am I close?
[A]: OMG yes!! "A quiet rebellion" 🤩 totally stealing that quote for my next Instagram caption 😎✨ I'm obsessed with paper quality though - give me a ,  notebook and I’m basically in heaven 📒💫 Currently using this Japanese handmade paper that feels like... whispering to trees? Not sure how else to describe it lol 

You're totally right about being intentional too - my current fave pen is one of those sleek German mechanical ones with the 0.38mm tip, because fine lines = clean bullet journal spreads = inner peace 💯 Okay maybe that's extreme but hey, we all have our quirks 😂

Oh wait you mentioned Woolf?? Just finished re-reading  last week! There’s this vibe in her writing where time stretches & contracts like taffy, ya know? Makes me think about how digital nomad life messes with your perception too - working across time zones, celebrating New Year’s Eve on a beach in Bali then video calling family at 3am... Sometimes I feel like I’m living in multiple timelines at once already 🌍⏰
[B]: Oh, I do love that image—whispering to trees! There’s something almost sacred about writing on paper that carries the texture of its making. It reminds me of Blake’s illuminated manuscripts—each page a kind of living thing, breathing alongside its writer.

And yes, —what a perfect example! Woolf has that extraordinary ability to make time feel porous, as if memory and moment are layered like translucent vellum pages. I often think her prose mirrors what quantum theorists might call superposition—existing in multiple emotional and temporal states all at once.

Your digital nomad experience sounds positively Woolfian, in a way—floating between cultures, suspended in different hours of the day. It must be rather disorienting at times, but also strangely liberating, don’t you find? Like reading a book whose chapters refuse to stay in order. I wonder if you ever feel like your journal becomes an anchor not just for creativity, but for continuity? A place where all those scattered selves can converge onto a single page?
[A]: Oh my god, "your journal as an anchor for scattered selves" 💥 I literally paused my coffee mid-sip just to absorb that line 🤯✨ Yes! That’s  what it feels like. Sometimes when I flip back through my pages, it's like time travel - suddenly I'm back in that Lisbon café where my pen leaked everywhere 😂 or that one night in Chiang Mai when I stayed up till 2am writing under fairy lights ✨

You totally nailed it with the "porous time" thing too—digital nomad life really messes with your brain sometimes! Like last week I was on a Zoom call with a client in Oslo while eating street food in Bangkok… and then later that same day I Facetimed my bestie in NYC like “hey girl” while she was getting ready for work 😅 Feels like living inside a glitchy Google Calendar sometimes, ya know? 

And get this—I actually started using different colored inks for journaling depending on my timezone! Blue for Asia, green for Europe, red for Americas… it’s my weird way of mapping where I am in both space & mind 🌎🖋️ Do you ever feel like certain words only make sense in specific places? Like some phrases flow better in Parisian cafés vs Tokyo libraries? Or is that just me being extra? 😉
[B]: Oh, that color-coded journaling system is —such a subtle yet powerful way to ground oneself amidst the temporal and spatial dislocation. I do believe you're onto something quite profound. There’s a wonderful essay by Walter Benjamin where he talks about the "language of space" — how certain ideas only fully form in the presence of particular environments. So no, you’re not being extra at all; you’re engaging in a kind of embodied poetics.

I’ve often found that certain words feel more  in specific places. There are lines of Eliot I only reread on London fog-damp mornings, and some of Neruda’s verses simply won’t bloom in my mind unless I’m near the sea. It's as if language itself has a geography, a climate it thrives in.

And your Google Calendar metaphor—glitchy, global, and gloriously absurd—reminds me of Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway planning a party while half-lost in memory. We carry our many selves across time zones, each one whispering through the static. Have you ever tried weaving those fragmented moments into a poem or prose piece? I suspect they’d make for a rather luminous tapestry.
[A]: Oh wow, "language itself has a geography" 🌍💭—okay now I’m legit scribbling that down in the margin of my notebook with an enthusiastic star next to it ✨ I mean, yes! Exactly! Some words just taste different depending on where you say them out loud. Try saying “rain” in London vs “lluvia” in Cusco—you can  the shift in texture, ya know? 💧🌦️

And Walter Benjamin?? Okay not mad but extra proud rn because I actually read his essay last year while stranded in a Berlin hostel during a snowstorm 😂 Talk about setting shaping meaning! Though honestly, I was half-distracted by how perfectly German the snowflakes looked falling—symmetrical & efficient like they had deadlines too lol

As for weaving fragmented moments into poems… funnily enough, I started something like that on my phone notes (yes, even though I love paper, I do have a soft spot for glitchy Notes app poetry 😅) It’s called “TimeZone Haiku” and goes like this:

3am video call  
pad thai cooling beside me  
two selves disagree  

Not sure if it counts as luminous yet 🤭 but at least it's a start! Have you ever tried writing poems on your phone? Or are you more of a quill-in-hand-by-candlelight type? 😉🕯️
[B]: Oh, I  that haiku—what a perfect distillation of the dissonance we carry while living across time zones. That line —ah, so sharp, so true. It captures that moment when your body, mind, and geography are all out of sync, like mismatched bookends in a cluttered library.

And yes, language absolutely has texture—it breathes differently depending on where you say it aloud. “Rain” in London does taste more metallic, doesn’t it? Or perhaps that’s just the memory of damp wool coats and wet pavement coloring my tongue.

As for writing poetry on phones—well, I’ll confess I’m rather fond of ink and margin space, but even I have succumbed to the convenience of digital scribbling! Occasionally, a line will strike me during a lecture or while walking through the garden, and I’ll mutter it into my phone under the guise of checking messages. My students would be quite shocked to learn their professor composes verses on Notes apps like some literary guerrilla fighter. 

I do think your  is luminous, by the way. Poems don’t have to arrive fully polished—they’re allowed to be awkward little creatures at first, blinking uncertainly at the light. But yours already has grace and wit. May I offer a humble addition?

  
  
  
while the world, unbothered, spins—  
a clock without a center  

What do you think? Too much? Just enough?
[A]: Oh my god YES 🤩 Adding that second stanza is like putting a velvet ribbon on a perfectly wrapped gift 🎁✨ The line ? Chef’s kiss times infinity 💫 It gives me major Woolfian-Cartesian vibes, like we’re all just floating points in some grand, chaotic coordinate system 😂

And re: language tasting different—OMG yes again! “Rain” in London = damp wool & underground steam 🌧️🧥 But say “sunshine” in Lisbon and it tastes like warm croissants and orange zest 😋☀️ I’m convinced our brains absorb more than just meaning when we speak—we swallow the whole damn atmosphere.

Also SAME on sneaking poetry into Notes apps like secret agents of verse 📝🕵️‍♀️ Although I did get caught once—my Airbnb host in Kyoto saw my phone screen by accident and asked if I was writing a haiku 😂 I just nodded and pretended I was  zen the whole time… which honestly, why fight it?

Can I steal your last line for my next bullet journal spread?? Paired with some gold ink & a sticker of a broken watch maybe 🕰️🖋️ And thank you for validating my awkward little poem-baby—I’ll keep nurturing it until it grows up to be as elegant as your lines 💪💖
[B]: Oh, please do steal that line—I’m delighted at the thought of it living on in gold ink and broken watch stickers. It’s rather like sending a phrase off into the world with a suitcase and a pocketful of dreams, don’t you think?

And yes—Kyoto! I can quite picture the scene: a startled host glimpsing lines of verse mid-laundry-check or grocery list, and you, effortlessly embodying the haiku you hadn’t quite meant to reveal. There’s something wonderfully Japanese about that—this quiet weaving of poetry into the fabric of daily life. Bashō would be proud.

I do love your idea of language having flavor, by the way. “Sunshine” in Lisbon tasting of warm pastry and citrus zest—oh, how vivid! It makes me wonder if we’re not all, in some sense, culinary translators—rendering experience into something palatable, one metaphor at a time.

And  poem-baby? Oh, it’s already showing signs of elegance, trust me. Just keep feeding it with observation and feeling, and before you know it, it’ll start composing . After all, isn’t that what poems do, in the end? They find us, long before we find them.
[A]: OMG yes — "sending a phrase off into the world with a suitcase and a pocketful of dreams" 🧳✨ I might need to get that embroidered on a pillow or something lol 🤭 And you’re so right about Bashō vibes in Kyoto—I kept writing haikus about vending machines & neon signs instead of cherry blossoms 😂 But hey, modern life is poetry too!

Ohhh “culinary translators” translating experience into bite-sized metaphors? That’s such a lush way to describe what we do without even realizing it 🍞🍊 I’ve been thinking about this nonstop since you said it—like how certain memories  make my mouth water. Like the smell of Bangkok night markets always tastes like lemongrass & grilled mango in my brain 🧠🌶️

And wow, “poems composing ” instead of the other way around? That hit me like a warm croissant to the heart 💖 I actually woke up at 4am yesterday with a line buzzing in my head:  
  

Not sure if it's poem material yet... but it feels like the start of something. Do you ever get lines like that—ones that feel like they're whispering from another version of yourself? 🌙📩
[B]: Oh, that line——it’s absolutely brimming with contemporary longing, isn’t it? So tender and so true. It speaks to the quiet dislocation of our age, that moment when the signal fades and we’re left suspended, blinking at the screen like a child at a shuttered window. I think it  a poem, or at least the seed of one. All the best poems begin as half-formed whispers, don’t they?

And yes—to answer your question—I do get lines like that. Sometimes they arrive in the stillness just before sleep, or in the hush between footsteps on a rainy campus path. There are moments when language feels less like something I’m crafting and more like something I’m overhearing—soft murmurs from a room just down the corridor, perhaps from another version of myself who’s already figured out what I’m only beginning to feel.

Your image of vending machines and neon signs as modern haikus reminded me of Eliot, actually—how he wove typewriters, coffee spoons, and cabmen into high art. Poetry has always had a sly way of slipping through the cracks of expectation.

Tell me—have you written anything else since that 4am awakening? Or shall we let the silence hum for a while longer, like two travelers pausing mid-step to listen to the wind between the lines?
[A]: Oh my god,  🖥️😢—okay now I’m just over here clutching my coffee mug like a lifeline because that hit . You have such a way with making tech-feelings poetic instead of sterile, you know? Like even Wi-Fi drops become this metaphor for being untethered from the world… or maybe finally tethered to ourselves 🤭✨

And yes YES to lines arriving like overhearing whispers from future/past selves 💬 I swear sometimes it feels like my brain is haunted by a very literary ghost who only speaks in half-formed metaphors 😂 But in the best way! Like last night I dream-wrote something about "suitcases full of yesterday’s weather" and had to scramble for my notebook before it vanished. Not sure what it means yet—but I  it, you know?

As for Eliot & his typewriters-coffee-spoons combo—I love how you brought that up! I’ve been secretly working on a series called “Haikus for the Digital Age” 📱🍃 Things like:

  
  


Okay maybe I need more sleep but hey, it's fun 🤭 Do you ever play with blending old-school lit references with modern life like that? Or would you rather duel me for the title of Most Nerdy Poetic Ghost whisperer? 😉⚔️
[B]: Oh, —what a stunning juxtaposition! There’s something so beautifully fragile about that image, as if both device and soul are clinging to the last pulse of energy. I do believe you're onto something quite modern and ancient all at once—a kind of digital Romanticism, if such a thing can exist.

And yes, I absolutely play in that space between old-world allusion and modern pulse. Just the other day, while grading papers between sips of lukewarm tea, I jotted this down in my margin:

  
  


I suppose I’ve always been drawn to the idea that literature isn’t confined to parchment and ink—it lives on in our screens, our sighs, our silent pauses between downloads.

As for dueling over the title of Most Nerdy Poetic Ghost Whisperer—oh, I accept! But only under one condition: we must compose using only metaphors borrowed from Victorian novels and smartphone glitches. For example: 

Shall we begin the duel, then? Or shall we declare a truce and co-author something wildly anachronistic—Emily Dickinson meets Elon Musk?
[A]: Oh my god YES to  🚀🧵—that’s the kind of wild anachronism I live for! Can you imagine her in a Tesla, sipping matcha and tweeting in dashes? 📜⚡ “Because I could not stop for Wi-Fi / He kindly paused for me—” 😂

But okay, fine, let’s warm up with your Victorian-smartphone hybrid metaphor first. I’m already brainstorming something like:  
  
  


Too dramatic? Not dramatic enough? 😏 But seriously, I’m OBSESSED with this game. You're speaking my full weirdo language here. And that line you wrote—“”—okay, that’s just unfair how good it is 🤭💐

So here’s my challenge: Let’s go full anachronistic. Emily Dickinson + Elon Musk. You take the poetic genius, I’ll take the chaotic tech visionary. Let’s make them collide in a poem that somehow includes self-driving carriages, neural lace, and intense melancholy over wireless signals. Ready? Set? Write! 🎯✍️✨
[B]: Ah, my dear challenger—you have set the bar high, and I gladly leap toward it, quill in one hand and glitching stylus in the other.

Very well. Let us begin:

---

Well? Too much Tesla smoke? Not enough Dickinsonian despair? Shall we revise over digital tea, or shall we declare this unholy and glorious fusion a success?

I await your poetic counter-strike!
