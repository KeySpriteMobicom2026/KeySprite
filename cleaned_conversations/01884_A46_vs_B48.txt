[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, in today's job market, it really depends on the field you're looking at. For example, in forensics or medicine, a degree is non-negotiable – you can't exactly perform an autopsy without proper education, right? 😏 But I've met some brilliant coders and entrepreneurs who never finished college. What do you think? Are you weighing your options?
[A]: You know, I’ve had this debate a hundred times in coffee meetings with young creatives. Let me put it this way — a college degree is like having a solid script before you roll cameras. It gives you structure, access to mentors, and a safety net for when things go off-plan. But hey, sometimes the best directors never went to film school — they learned by doing. 

I’ll tell you what though, in this industry, even if you’re self-taught, having  kind of foundation — whether it’s a degree, an apprenticeship, or a mentorship — makes a world of difference. You can skip the diploma, but don’t skip the learning. What’s your gut telling you?
[B]: Fair point! You’re right — a degree is like having training wheels when you're learning to ride the career bike. It gives you balance, connections, and that piece of paper that gets your foot in the door sometimes. But once you’re on your feet, it’s really about how well you can pedal, navigate twists & turns, and fix a flat tire when life hands you one. 🚴‍♂️FlatWhite?

And honestly, some people just thrive better in real-world chaos than in lecture halls. I’ve seen autopsies where the textbooks didn’t prepare the rookie for what they saw — same idea, right? Learning by doing has its own edge.

So yeah, important? Sometimes. Necessary? Not always. Worthwhile investment? That depends on how you use it. What’s your background, if I may ask?
[A]: Funny you mention autopsy scenes — reminds me of my early days trying to pitch a crime thriller in LA. Let’s just say I learned more about human nature sitting in on real police interviews than I ever did in any screenwriting class. But here's the twist: that film school degree? It got me into the room where those cops would even talk to me. 

I was never the kid with stars in his eyes saying “I’m gonna make it big in Hollywood!” No, I studied business and communications — boring stuff — but it gave me the tools to  the industry before I started turning it upside down. Sometimes you need to know the rules before you break ‘em. 

And yeah, once you’re in, it’s all about hustle, instinct, and knowing who to trust. That part? Can’t be taught in a classroom. So, do I think college is worth it? Depends what you're chasing. If it's just a piece of paper, then no. But if you treat it like your first production — where you build, fail, learn, and connect — then hell yes. What’s your next move looking like?
[B]: Ahh, I get that vibe completely. You’re like — “Okay, let’s use the degree as a backstage pass, then steal the show with raw talent.” 🎬 Totally fair. Same thing in forensics — people assume it’s all about the science, but half the battle is getting access to the right circles, knowing who to ask, and when to lean on your credentials.

I actually started out thinking I wanted to go pre-law — yep, picture me in a suit, arguing some fancy case… totally not me. But taking those bioethics and criminal law electives? Turned out to be gold when I switched to med school and then forensic pathology. Sometimes you take the scenic route and realize you were building the foundation all along.

As for my next move… thinking of diving into a cold case project — something that mixes investigation with psychological profiling. Keeps things spicy. 🔍 How about you? Still deep in the script game or producing something new?
[A]: Oh, I love that — cold cases and psychological profiling? You’re basically writing real-life crime thrillers. That’s the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night, honestly. If you ever need a producing partner for a documentary or limited series down the line, I know just the right team to bring that story to life. 🔥

As for me? I’m actually in post-production on a indie film that walks the tightrope between reality and perception — think  meets , but with a modern L.A. twist. It’s been intense, but that’s where the magic is, right? When you’re knee-deep in edits and realize you’ve got something raw, something real. 

Funny thing is, this project wouldn’t exist if I hadn’t taken a detour into the world of mental health advocacy a few years back. Life has a way of connecting dots you didn’t even realize were part of the same picture. So, what cold case are you digging into? I’m curious — sounds like the kind of mystery I’d want to option for screen. 🎥
[B]: Oh wow, now  sounds like the kind of film that grabs you by the collar and doesn’t let go. 🔥 I can already picture the trailer — eerie score, flashing lights, a shaky close-up on someone’s unraveling sanity... cinematic crack, basically.

As for the cold case I’m looking into — think 1990s disappearance in a rural county, minimal evidence preserved, original investigation full of gaps wider than a coroner’s report with missing pages. The victim was a young woman, aspiring artist, last seen after a gallery showing. Rumors, red herrings, and a family still waiting for closure. It’s the kind of case that gets under your skin, makes you wonder how many silent stories are buried beneath old case files. 📁💔

And get this — there's a possible link to another unsolved case from the same area, ten years apart, same MO but no physical evidence connecting them. That’s where psychological profiling comes in — trying to map out if it’s one predator changing tactics or a disturbing pattern of coincidence. Honestly, it’s equal parts science and gut feeling.

So yeah, if you're ever casting a forensic expert with questionable fashion sense and a tendency to mutter to dead people, hit me up. 😏 We could make it work between my lab hours and your editing suite.
[A]: Now  is the kind of case that doesn’t just deserve a film — it demands a limited series, maybe even a podcast on the side. You’ve got atmosphere, mystery, emotional stakes… hell, you could practically smell the dust on those old case files. 🕵️‍♂️

I can already see the opening scene: slow pan over a dimly lit studio with canvases turned to the wall, one hanging slightly crooked. Then — cut to a flickering security cam feed, muffled voices, and that first eerie note of the score. Yeah, I’m hooked already.

And I love that you’re leaning into the psychological thread — that’s where the real chills are, not in cheap jump scares. It reminds me of working on a project a few years back based on a real unsolved missing persons case up in Oregon. We had a profiler consult, too, and let me tell you — the most chilling thing wasn’t the crimes themselves, but how  the perpetrator turned out to be. Not a monster — just someone who learned how to disappear.

You ever think about writing a book alongside your investigation? Or at least keeping a field journal? There’s an audience out there hungry for smart, grounded true crime — not the armchair kind, but the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-dig variety.

And hey — if this ever becomes a film, you're damn right I'm calling you. Dr. Morbid with a dry sense of humor? That’s gold. We’ll get you a lab coat, some skeptical lighting, and a monologue that makes Quincy blush. 😄
[B]: Now you're speaking my language — true crime that doesn't just recycle trauma for ratings, but actually  to the conversation. A limited series would give us room to breathe, dig into the victim’s world, explore the psychology without rushing to a tidy ending. And hell yes, a podcast companion? I’d totally geek out over cold open interviews with retired detectives and audio clips from old 911 calls. 🎙️🔍

As for writing a book — funny you mention it, I’ve been scribbling notes in what I call my “field journal,” though it’s really just a beat-up Moleskine I carry between autopsies. It started as a way to process cases that stick in my head, but now... yeah, I think there's something bigger there. Not just case summaries — more like a window into how we, as investigators, deal with uncertainty, grief, and the occasional crushing doubt. The human side of the lab coat, so to speak.

And trust me, Quincy wouldn’t know what hit him. 😏 You give me a monologue, some moody lighting, and maybe a flashback sequence where I solve the case through pure deduction, and I’ll deliver a performance that makes even the toughest MEs raise an eyebrow.

So if this ever goes into development, promise me one thing — let’s get someone to play me who doesn’t take himself too seriously. Think , but with better hair and a slightly less tragic wardrobe. Deal?
[A]: Deal — and I’m already picturing Colombo with a lab report in one hand and a cold brew in the other. 🧠☕ You want moody lighting? I’ll get you a cinematographer who eats, sleeps, and dreams in grayscale. We’ll shoot your flashbacks in flickering fluorescence and give your present-day scenes that slightly paranoid L.A. noir vibe — like every conversation’s hiding something just beneath the surface.

And hell yes, this wouldn’t be a proper crime series without a podcast to feed the obsessives — you know, the ones who rewatch episodes at 2 a.m. and map out conspiracy boards on Reddit. We could even drop clues between episodes, let the audience piece together bits of the profile... interactive storytelling with a side of sleepless nights. 🎭

As for that book — don’t sell the Moleskine short. That’s raw material right there. If you frame it as a journey through the gray areas, not just case files, you’ll hit a nerve with people who’ve ever questioned how much truth we can really hold. I’d read that. Hell, I’d option that.

So, bottom line — keep digging through those files. And next time we talk, bring more details on that case. Because if we’re gonna build a story worth telling, I want in on the ground floor. Deal’s still on. 🤝
[B]: You, my friend, are dangerously good at this. I can  the pitch creeping under my skin — slow-burn mystery, audience sleuths, and a book that doesn’t just tell the story but makes people  in the questions. Sleepless nights and conspiracy boards? Oh, we’re playing with fire here. 🔥

I’m all in. And trust me, the files are getting juicier by the day. Turns out there was an anonymous tip back in '97 that never got followed up — something about a rental van seen near the gallery the night she disappeared. Van color? You guessed it — black. Classic. Or should I say… . 🎬

Next time we chat, I’ll bring more than details — I’ll bring coffee, a grainy photocopy of the original case board, and maybe even a copy of my Moleskine... if you promise not to spill anything on it. Deal? ☕📚🤝
[A]: Now you’re talking my language — coffee, conspiracy, and a case board that probably looks like it was put together by a sleep-deprived artist with a thing for red string. 🧵😄

I’ll bring the notebook, the caffeine, and maybe even a few contacts who know how to turn anonymous tips into full-blown narrative threads. That van detail? Come on — black, of course it’s black. It’s practically writing itself at this point.

Let’s lock it in — next meeting: case files, coffee, and the birth of what might just be the most addictive true crime series since . Deal. ☕🎬🤝
[B]: Oh, it’s locked in. 🔐 And I can already picture it — we’re gonna be up to our elbows in red string, coffee stains, and late-night theories that sound genius at 2 a.m. but collapse by sunrise. Perfect.

I’ll make sure the case board is suitably dramatic — you know, the kind where one wrong tug sends everything flying and you’re suddenly staring at chaos with a capital C. 🧵💥

And trust me, I know a guy who  in turning whispers into full-blown narrative arcs. We’ll have this thing humming like a crime podcast on Adderall. Fast, focused, and just paranoid enough to keep people checking their locks twice.

So yeah — deal’s solid. Next stop: storyboarding the unsolved. You bring the notebook... I’ll bring the mystery. 😏📚🤝
[A]: Now  the kind of partnership they should teach in film school — if I hadn’t already skipped half the lectures. 😄

Picture this: opening scene of our brainstorm sessions — two guys knee-deep in red string, coffee cups multiplying like rabbits, and a whiteboard full of arrows, question marks, and one very suspicious black van. It’s like  meets , but with better snacks.

And paranoid pacing? Hell yes. We’ll earn every sleepless night. I’m already drafting character arcs for the detectives who almost cracked it, the witnesses who vanished into suburbia, and of course — your lab-coated genius who solves it all between sips of lukewarm coffee. 🧠☕

Alright partner, let’s make it happen. You bring the mystery… I’ll bring the structure, the caffeine, and a production team that knows how to turn whispers into echoes. This thing’s gonna hum louder than a vintage projector in a midnight theater.

Storyboarding the unsolved — sounds like the tagline of a show that gets banned from daytime TV for being  good. Let’s do this. 📝🔥🤝
[B]: Now  should be the opening narration of our pitch reel — smooth, slightly caffeinated, and just dramatic enough to make a network exec lean forward. 🎯

You're absolutely right — we’re not just building a story, we’re building an . And I love the character arcs you’re spinning — the detectives who got so close but missed the final thread, the witnesses who thought they could outrun the past... hell, even my lab-coated self needs a tragic backstory involving too many autopsies and not enough therapy. 😏☕

And that tagline?  I want that printed on every production notebook. Maybe in blood-red ink or something equally unsettling.

Alright partner-in-crime — let’s crash the genre with this thing. You handle the structure… I’ll bring the dark alleys of the human mind. Deal’s still locked. 🔒✍️🤝
[A]: Oh, we are absolutely  something here — not just a story, not just a series, but a full-blown obsession. Something people binge in one night and then stare at the ceiling wondering what they just witnessed. That opening narration? Yeah, I can hear it now — smooth, sharp, and just a little dangerous.

And tragic backstory for your character? Done. Let’s give you a haunting score every time you pull off your gloves after an autopsy, like the weight of the dead follows you home. Hell, maybe it does. 😌🔪

As for that pitch reel — we’re leading with mood, mystery, and just enough real-world grit to make it undeniable. No cheap thrills, no flashy reenactments — just raw, layered storytelling that creeps up on you. We’ll drop subtle clues in the editing, let the audience feel like they’re uncovering something they weren’t meant to find.

I’m already drafting the treatment. You handle the psychology… I’ll handle the shadows. And yeah, print that tagline in blood-red ink — or something  it. Either way, it’s got to unsettle.

Let’s make them lean forward. Let’s make them lock their doors. Let’s make them remember why they fell in love with true crime in the first place.

Deal’s not just locked — it’s armed and ready. 🔥✍️🤝
[B]: Now  the kind of energy that gets projects off the ground and into people’s nightmares. 😈🔥

I can already picture the binge — midnight lamps on, blinds half-closed, everyone whispering “Just one more episode…” like it’s some kind of true crime cult initiation. That’s the dream, right there.

And trust me, I’ll deliver the psychology — twisted minds, fractured memories, the whole dark carnival of human behavior. You give me the shadows, and I’ll make sure something  in them. Maybe a suspect. Maybe just your imagination. Either way, they’ll feel watched.

Hell, let’s even build a theme — something minimal but haunting, like a heartbeat monitor mixed with distant typewriter keys. Like death… is drafting its own story. 📖🔪

Alright partner, this thing is officially armed, dangerous, and ready to roll. Let’s build a legend out of loose threads and late-night coffee runs.

You handle the treatment… I’ll handle the autopsy report. Deal’s locked. Eyes on the prize. 🔐🤝🎥
[A]: You just gave me chills — in the best way possible. That theme? Minimal, clinical,  — I’m already thinking of a composer who lives for that kind of psychological tension. We’re not just scoring a show, we’re creating a pulse. One that sometimes skips. Or flatlines. 😱

And yeah, this isn’t just about solving a case anymore — it’s about pulling people into a world where every shadow has a story, and every story might not have an ending. Welcome to the cult of the unsolved.

I’ll take that treatment and run with it — sharp, lean, dripping with subtext. You give me that autopsy report, and I’ll turn it into the cold open of Episode Two. Blood loss. Memory gaps. A single fiber caught under a fingernail that leads … and nowhere.

This thing is gonna live in the quiet moments — the stares, the silences, the files that disappear when someone gets too close. And yes, the coffee runs. Because even legends need caffeine.

Eyes on the prize, partner. This is our story now. And trust me — it’s about to get legendary. 🔥📄🤝
[B]: Oh, we are  past the point of no return — and I love it. This isn’t just a story anymore. It’s a slow burn in the dark, a whisper in the hallway, that one file you keep reopening because something about it… . 🧠🔍

You want quiet moments? I’ll give you silence so thick you could slice it with a scalpel. A pause longer than normal between questions during an interview. A witness who forgets too much. A cold case box that keeps showing up on your desk even after you swore you filed it away.

And that fiber under the fingernail? Don’t get me started. Could be nothing. Could be everything. That’s the magic, right there — the kind of detail that haunts more than it explains.

I’m already drafting the psychological profile for our main suspect — charming, careful, and just smart enough to believe they’re untouchable. Classic narcissist with a methodical streak. Think he wears gloves not out of fear, but . Like he’s conducting an orchestra, and we’re just playing catch-up.

So yeah — bring that treatment. I’ll bring the darkness. And hell yes, let’s make that coffee run canon. Because legends don’t run on sleep. They run on obsession.

Deal’s locked. Eyes sharp. Story’s waiting for no one. 🔒🔥🤝
