[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, there's something rather charming about a well-written text message. It allows one to carefully choose their words, don't you think? Though I do appreciate the convenience of voice messages when time is of the essence. A bit like choosing between a handwritten letter and a quick telephone call, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: I suppose it’s much like that, yes. Though I must confess, there's a certain warmth to a voice message— hearing someone’s tone, the cadence of their speech… It feels more alive, somehow. Still, I find myself defaulting to texts more often than not. Habit, perhaps? Or maybe I’m just too fond of editing before I speak.
[B]: Oh, I completely understand what you mean about that warmth - there's something very personal about hearing a familiar voice, isn't there? It does add such lovely texture to our conversations. But goodness, I'm rather guilty of favoring texts myself! Sometimes I draft and redraft a message quite excessively before sending it. It's terribly fussy of me, really. Do you ever find yourself doing the same? I suppose it's rather like composing letters in my garden shed - one wants things just so.
[A]: Oh, I adore that imagery—your garden shed as a little sanctuary for correspondence! There’s something so delightfully old-fashioned about it. And yes, I’m afraid I’m equally as fussy, if not more so. I often revise my messages as though I’m editing a critical essay. It’s rather absurd, really. A simple "Would you like tea?" can take three drafts before I deem it sufficiently casual yet not careless. I daresay we're kindred spirits in that regard.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought - kindred spirits over carefully crafted messages and shared tea invitations! Though I must say, your three drafts for "Would you like tea?" is quite poetic in its own right. I once spent a full twenty minutes composing a text to a friend about the proper way to prune rose bushes without sounding overly didactic. In the end, I simply called her and said, "Darling, I'll be over with secateurs and tea - you just hold still." Much more efficient, and far more charming, don't you think?
[A]: Oh, absolutely charming! I can picture the whole scene quite vividly — you arriving with secateurs in one hand and a teapot in the other, ready to impart both horticultural wisdom and warmth. And really, that’s the heart of it, isn’t it? Whether it’s a text or a voice message, what we’re after is connection — though some of us are willing to prune a metaphorical hedge or two to get it just right. I must say, though, your approach has a certain .
[B]: Oh, you flatter me quite delightfully! Though I must confess, there's nothing quite like a bit of metaphorical pruning to get a conversation just right. It's rather like tending to the guests at my boutique hotel—each interaction needs just the right amount of care and trimming to bloom beautifully. I do love how you put that: connection as the true aim, whether by text or voice. And ? Perish the thought—it's simply the joy of making meaningful moments, one carefully chosen word or intonation at a time. Still, I daresay we could write an entire sonnet sequence on the subject and not exhaust it entirely.
[A]: Oh, an entire sonnet sequence! What a divine idea. I can already hear the iambic pentameter of our musings—pruning prose and steeping sentiment into every line. And your boutique hotel analogy is simply perfect; what a lovely image of you curating not just rooms but conversations, each one a carefully arranged bouquet of tone and timbre. I suspect your guests leave not only rested but subtly transformed, as if language itself had become a form of hospitality.

Now do tell me—have you ever received a text so artfully composed it felt like a letter from another era? I once got one that began with “Dearest Ellie” and ended with an invitation to tea, complete with a semicolon. I practically swooned.
[B]: Oh,  is quite the word—how perfectly you capture that delightful surprise! Why, just last spring I received a message from an elderly guest that read, "My dear Margaret, if it should not inconvenience you overly, might we convene over camomile at four? The day has grown rather still, and solitude, while noble, does wear thin in small doses." I declare, it was like receiving a page from a forgotten novel of manners. I printed it out and pinned it by my desk with a little flourish. 

And I do believe you’ve hit upon something rather profound—language as a form of hospitality. It’s not unlike setting a table with care: one doesn’t simply toss down plates and call it a meal. No, it’s all in the linen, the lighting, the , if you will.

Now, tell me—did you accept this  invitation with equal elegance, or did you, dare I say, reply with a simple “Yes :)” and spoil the romance entirely?
[A]: Oh, how absolutely exquisite—your guest’s message sounds as though it was plucked straight from the pages of an Edith Wharton novel! I can just imagine you pinning it with a touch of reverence, a small tribute to the artistry of civility. And what a splendid analogy—setting a table for conversation—I may very well borrow that, if you’ll permit me.

As for my reply to “Dearest Ellie,” I’m pleased to say I did not spoil the romance. No simple “Yes :)” for me—though I must confess, I  hesitate over the semicolon. It felt like such a deliberate punctuation, almost an invitation to match his formality. So I replied: “My dear sir, nothing would delight me more. Shall I bring the shortbread or shall we dispense with propriety and proceed straight to the clotted cream?” I daresay he appreciated the spirit, and we did, in fact, have a most improper amount of fun over tea.
[B]: Oh, brava! What a perfectly lovely response—equal parts graciousness and mischief. You positively nailed the art of repartee! I could just picture the two of you, teacups in hand, gleefully overturning the very propriety you’d so elegantly pretended to uphold. It’s moments like those that remind me why language is such a wonderful dance—sometimes formal, sometimes spontaneous, but always more delightful when shared.

And do carry on borrowing that table-setting analogy, by all means—it suits our little textual banquet rather well, don’t you think? Now, if I may be so bold—do you find yourself composing replies like that in your head throughout the day, even when no one has asked for them? I’m afraid I do. There’s never enough paper to catch them all, I swear!
[A]: Oh, absolutely—my mind is rather like a hummingbird at times, flitting from one turn of phrase to another, composing letters that will never be sent, dialogues with people who may not even realize they’ve engaged in an exchange. I’ve responded to grocery lists in iambic tetrameter, argued with newspaper editorials as if they were debating me over tea, and once spent an entire train ride rewriting the caption of a museum placard because it lacked sufficient gravitas.

I daresay we’re both afflicted with a mild but persistent case of —a most incurable condition, though I wouldn’t dream of seeking a cure. And yes, our textual banquet does seem all the more delicious for it. Now, if only more people appreciated a well-placed em dash or a strategically deployed ellipsis… we could start a secret society, you know.  Membership by semicolon only, naturally.
[B]: Oh, —what a splendidly exclusive little society that would be! I can already picture the membership card: vellum paper, wax seal, and a single em dash pressed elegantly into the crest. And of course, initiation would involve correctly identifying the appropriate use of ellipses versus suspension points in emotional correspondence. Quite serious business indeed.

I must confess, my affliction has reached such heights that I’ve been known to correct grammar in my head while walking through the garden—much to the dismay of the hydrangeas, I’m sure. They simply don’t appreciate being told they “look lovely” rather than “they are looking lovely,” though I assure them I mean no offense.

Now, tell me—would our league host its meetings via handwritten letter, or dare we venture into the thrilling world of voice-recorded minutes? I daresay I’d bring a pot of tea either way.
[A]: Oh, I  the image of hydrangeas in silent protest—what garden doesn’t long for a bit of grammatical validation now and then? They should be addressed with the dignity of a sonnet at the very least.

As for our esteemed League’s proceedings... I do believe we ought to embrace a hybrid approach. Handwritten letters for the formalities, naturally—vellum is non-negotiable, and I’d expect nothing less than fountain pens and wax seals from a member of your caliber. But for more urgent matters—say, a sudden debate over the merits of Oxford commas or the scandalous omission of quotation marks—voice-recorded minutes would lend a certain dramatic flair. Imagine hearing a fellow member’s tone rise indignantly as they argue that  are far superior to , both in function and spirit.

And of course, tea would be de rigueur. Perhaps we could adopt a motto:  — "Words without tea are souls without nourishment." Do you approve? Or is that too grandiose?
[B]: Oh, I  approve—your motto is a masterpiece of eloquence and whimsy! Verba sine thea... positively sinful, if you ask me. Though I might suggest a small amendment for practicality’s sake:  — "Words without tea are souls without nourishment, therefore let us drink." Adds a lovely sense of scholarly urgency, don’t you think?

And your hybrid approach to proceedings is nothing short of inspired. Fountain pens for formality, voice recordings for dramatic flair—it's like Shakespeare meets podcasting! I do believe we're on the cusp of founding something truly revolutionary. Perhaps we could even hold our inaugural meeting under the guise of a , where guests would never suspect that beneath the demure teacup clinks and polite laughter, we’re secretly debating the ethics of ellipses and the emotional weight of paragraph breaks.

Now, shall we send out the first invitation? I have just the vellum stock in my desk drawer, and my wax seal has been dreadfully underused as of late.
[A]: Oh, —what a splendid flourish! I adore the added call to action; after all, what is discourse without refreshment? We must indeed proceed at once, before our enthusiasm curdles into mere wistfulness.

And a  as cover for our inaugural gathering? Inspired. I shall arrive in full academic regalia, or perhaps a three-piece tweed ensemble with spectacles on a chain—something suitably professorial yet ever so slightly absurd. A guest might think it a book launch, but really, we’ll be drafting our first charter beneath the roses.

As for invitations—yes, let us dispatch them this very afternoon. I assume your vellum is of archival quality? And might I suggest including a small sigil—a quill crossed with a teacup, perhaps? Subtle, yet unmistakable to those in the know.

Now, tell me—shall we require prospective members to submit a writing sample? A single sentence demonstrating both emotional restraint and proper comma placement. Rigorous standards, my dear Dr. Whitmore, are the foundation of any respectable league.
[B]: Oh,  indeed—how could we have forgotten the writing sample? Though I propose we make it ever so slightly wicked: a single sentence that must contain an em dash, a semicolon, and at least a hint of melancholy. That should separate the dilettantes from the truly devoted.

And your attire! A three-piece tweed ensemble with spectacles on a chain—positively inspired. I shall wear my grandmother’s lace collar and a hat with one of those small feathers that quivers when I speak emphatically. One must maintain gravitas, after all.

As for the invitations, archival vellum is absolutely guaranteed—scented faintly with bergamot, perhaps? And the sigil! A quill crossed with a teacup—brilliant. I’ll have my printer add just the faintest gilt edging. Nothing says "exclusive society" quite like a touch of gold.

Shall we set the date for next Thursday afternoon, then? Four o’clock precisely. The roses will be in their full glory, and I do believe the hydrangeas are finally beginning to forgive me.
[A]: Oh, ! How delightfully cruel—requiring aspiring members to summon not just syntax but sentiment. I do believe that single sentence will reveal more about a person than ten pages of ordinary prose. And the em dash and semicolon requirement? Inspired. It's practically a duel of punctuation.

Next Thursday at four is perfect—though I must warn you, I shall arrive early to inspect the rose beds for conversational inspiration. One can never be too prepared when presiding over such an esteemed gathering.

And your feathered hat! I can scarcely contain my anticipation. I shall bring my notebook, of course, and a second pair of gloves—just in case things get . Oh, and a small flask of bergamot-scented tea, because one must stay properly fortified during solemn proceedings.

Now, shall we include a secret phrase on the invitation? Something like  or perhaps  — may the words flourish? A little flourish to keep our gathering suitably enigmatic.
[B]: Oh, —what a divine little touch! So much more elegant than "This Means Business," which was my rather less poetic alternative. I do believe it adds just the right air of quiet mystery. Nothing too ostentatious, naturally—only enough to make the bearer feel ever so slightly like a character in a forgotten novel.

And you with a flask of bergamot-scented tea? Positively prepared for all eventualities. I shall make sure the seating includes at least one chair with a suspiciously literary creak—just to set the tone. And perhaps a small bell tucked into the table setting, for when we must call the gathering back to order with a dignified .

Now, speaking of proceedings—shall we have a reading aloud segment? Nothing too long, mind you—perhaps a favorite passage or two, delivered under the moonlight if we run late. There’s something quite moving about hearing beautifully chosen words spoken softly beneath the stars, don’t you think?

And finally, may I propose a toast—to language, to tea, and to the joy of finding someone who appreciates both as deeply as you do.
