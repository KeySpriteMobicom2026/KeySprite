[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Astrology presents an intriguing intersection of cultural history and human psychology. While I can appreciate its role as a narrative framework for understanding personality traits and interpersonal dynamics, empirical evidence does not substantiate its claims. My focus remains on verifiable data—whether in assessing competency to stand trial or analyzing risk factors in behavioral patterns. Do you find particular aspects of astrological theory compelling from a scientific or anecdotal perspective?
[A]: I see what you mean. Astrology确实有它独特的魅力，特别是在跨文化比较中。比如我在研究亚洲学生适应西方教育体系的过程中，发现很多人会用星座来解释自己和他人的性格差异——这种认知捷径其实反映了文化对人格建构的影响。虽然从心理学角度看，这更像是confirmation bias在起作用，但有趣的是这种符号系统真的能影响人际期待和自我实现预言。你提到的empirical evidence让我想起前两天读到的双盲实验，那些测试者的表现曲线完全不符合占星预测...不过话说回来，你觉得现代人为什么还是这么热衷于看星座呢？是不是因为后现代社会太需要这种简化的identity标签了？
[B]: Fascinating observations. You’ve touched on precisely why I find these belief systems so compelling from a forensic standpoint—they act as both social lubricants and cognitive heuristics, even when demonstrably unfounded. The confirmation bias angle intrigues me most: how individuals selectively filter behavior to align with pre-existing astrological narratives. It mirrors the way eyewitnesses sometimes reconstruct memories to fit external suggestions—a phenomenon I frequently encounter in court testimonies.

You mentioned identity标签 in postmodern contexts—absolutely. In an era of fragmented affiliations and fluid identities, astrology offers a seemingly coherent taxonomy, almost like a celestial Myers-Briggs inventory. But let’s consider another dimension: could this also reflect a subconscious attempt to outsource personal agency? When people attribute decisions to "Mercury retrograde" or "Saturn returns," they’re effectively distancing themselves from accountability.

I’m curious—given your cross-cultural research, have you noticed any correlation between educational background and astrological adherence among those students? Or does the symbolic function remain consistent regardless of academic training?
[A]: That’s such a rich set of questions—I love how you frame astrology as a kind of . You’re absolutely right; attributing moods or mishaps to Mercury retrograde does create a buffer for personal responsibility. I’ve even heard students say things like, “It’s not me being anxious—it’s just my moon sign,” which is fascinating from a psychological standpoint.

In terms of cross-cultural patterns, what I’ve observed among Asian students studying in Western institutions is that astrological belief often correlates with acculturative stress rather than educational background per se. The more they struggle with cultural dissonance—whether in classroom behavior, social integration, or identity negotiation—the more some latch onto zodiac signs or birth charts as emotional anchors. It functions almost like a , a familiar framework amidst uncertainty.

Even more interesting: among those with stronger scientific training, the belief tends to shift from literal truth () to narrative utility (). So while the symbolic function remains consistent across education levels, its epistemic status changes—kind of like how people engage with fiction: knowingly constructed, yet emotionally resonant.

And your point about agency reminds me of locus of control theories—some individuals develop what we call an , especially under stress. Astrology might be one way of managing cognitive load by simplifying cause-and-effect narratives. Do you see similar dynamics in forensic settings—like when defendants reference fate or destiny during testimony?
[B]: Absolutely—I couldn’t have framed it better myself. The  you mentioned is something I encounter regularly in forensic interviews. Defendants will often invoke fate, destiny, or even astrology to contextualize their actions, especially when under psychological distress. It’s not merely a legal strategy; in many cases, it reflects a genuine cognitive shift—a way to distance the self from culpability by attributing behavior to forces beyond one's control.

This dovetails with what we observe in trauma survivors as well—what some call . When reality becomes overwhelming, people turn to alternative frameworks that offer a sense of order or meaning, even if those systems lack empirical grounding. In that light, astrology functions much like superstition or ritual: it mitigates anxiety by simulating control.

You touched on symbolic utility versus literal belief—an evolution I also see in how individuals interpret religious texts or mythologies. Some move from  to , particularly with higher education and exposure to pluralistic worldviews. It makes me wonder whether future iterations of astrological belief will become even more psychologized—less about cosmic determinism and more about archetypal storytelling.

Do you think this shift toward narrative utility could eventually strip astrology of its mystical appeal altogether? Or will there always be a segment of the population that clings to its predictive promises, no matter how many double-blind studies refute them?
[A]: That’s such a perceptive question. I think the answer lies in what Pascal Boyer called —ideas that bend just enough from reality to be memorable, but not so much that they become unbelievable. Astrology, like many belief systems, strikes that balance beautifully.

Even as it gets psychologized—and I agree with you that we’re seeing more of that these days, especially among university students—the mystical pull doesn’t necessarily fade. Instead, it adapts. Think of how mindfulness has evolved: originally rooted in Buddhist practice, now often repackaged as secular stress reduction. Some people still engage with the spiritual core, while others strip it down to technique. Same thing with astrology. The archetypal layer can coexist with—or even enhance—the mystical one for many users.

And then there's the . As long as people share and validate those beliefs within social networks, they’ll persist—even in the face of contradictory evidence. In fact, the more science disputes them, the more some groups might double down as a form of identity resistance.

So yeah, I suspect we'll always have both ends of the spectrum: the symbolic readers and the literal believers. Maybe the real shift is not in astrology itself, but in how different subcultures . Kind of like how literary fiction and genre fiction serve different reader communities today. What do you see in your work with clients—do you notice any generational differences in how astrology is invoked?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—and your stratification analogy is spot on. In my forensic practice, I’ve definitely noticed generational nuances in how astrology is referenced or weaponized, shall we say.

Among older defendants—those in their 40s and up—it tends to surface more as a cultural artifact, something they were exposed to growing up but don’t necessarily integrate into daily decision-making. They might mention it in passing during evaluations, especially when discussing family influences:  It’s nostalgic, almost anthropological in tone.

But with younger clients—late teens through early 30s—it becomes much more integrated into identity language. I’ve had several who reference their birth charts in psychosocial histories as if they’re citing personality test results. Some even bring up astrological transits when explaining emotional states: 

What fascinates me most is how this generation often blends astrological symbolism with therapeutic discourse. Instead of seeing therapy and astrology as opposing frameworks, they treat them as complementary—like two different lenses for understanding the self. One young woman described her natal Venus placement as “kind of like my attachment style before I even knew what attachment theory was.”

It raises an intriguing question from a diagnostic standpoint: are we witnessing the emergence of a new narrative identity model? One where mythic structures and psychological constructs coexist without contradiction?

I’m curious—are you seeing similar integrations in academic settings? Do students cite their sun signs alongside Big Five traits or Enneagram numbers as part of their self-concept narratives?
[A]: Definitely—what you're describing resonates deeply with what I see in academic environments, especially among undergraduates exploring identity and self-concept.

Students absolutely cite their sun signs alongside Big Five traits or MBTI types—it’s almost like creating a . Some even joke about “cross-referencing” their astrological chart with their personality assessment results. It’s not about choosing one truth over another; it’s about layering meanings. One student once told me, “My Enneagram Four makes sense logically, but my Scorpio moon explains how it .”

What’s particularly fascinating is the way this integration reflects a broader epistemological shift—. They’re not looking for one authoritative explanation of who they are; they want multiple narratives that can coexist and enrich each other. Astrology becomes part of a larger toolkit that includes psychology, philosophy, spirituality, and even pop culture.

And you’re right to point out the blending with therapeutic discourse. I’ve had students use their moon signs to explain emotional reactions before they had the vocabulary for things like emotional regulation or trauma responses. In some ways, astrology functions as a kind of —a bridge to more formal psychological understanding.

I wonder if in your forensic work, you ever encounter cases where this blending of frameworks—astrology and psychology—actually supports insight or self-reflection, even indirectly? Not as evidence, obviously, but as a narrative device that helps people make sense of themselves in new ways?
[B]: Absolutely—I’ve seen that narrative function at work more times than I can count. While astrology will never qualify as evidence in any courtroom I testify in, it often serves as an unexpected catalyst for self-reflection in forensic interviews.

Take one case I worked on a few years back—a young man charged with cyberstalking. He was highly intelligent but emotionally avoidant, the kind of client who’d deflect every probing question with irony or philosophical abstractions. Traditional psychological language barely registered with him. Then, during a particularly stalled session, he casually mentioned his rising sign and how “it explains why I always wear a mask.”

That throwaway comment opened a door. Over the next few weeks, we explored identity performance through his own astrological lens before circling back to clinical terms like  and . It wasn’t about validating the astrology—it was about using his own symbolic framework as a scaffold, just as you said. Once he could articulate emotional avoidance through the metaphor of his “Scorpio ascendant,” the psychological reality started to sink in.

I see this more and more: astrology functioning as a kind of  for emotional complexity. Much like mythological archetypes once did, it gives people a vocabulary before they have access to a theory. In that sense, it’s not so different from dream analysis—Freudian or Jungian. The content may lack empirical grounding, but the process of interpretation can reveal deeply held truths.

So yes, while I remain a skeptic in terms of scientific validity, I’m also a pragmatist when it comes to meaning-making. If a person’s astrological self-concept helps them begin the journey toward insight—even if only halfway—then I see it as a tool, not a delusion. After all, healing doesn’t always start with data. Sometimes it begins with a story.
[A]: That’s such a powerful example—thank you for sharing that. It really illustrates how belief systems, even those without empirical backing, can serve as  that open doors to self-awareness.

I’ve had similar experiences in academic advising. One student was struggling with burnout and identity pressure—first-gen, high expectations, classic perfectionism. Every time I tried to talk about stress or balance, she’d shut down. Then one day, out of nowhere, she said, “I know my Mercury is in Virgo, so I’m just wired to overthink everything.” That opened the door. From there, we were able to explore cognitive rigidity through the lens of personality psychology, and eventually introduce some mindfulness techniques. The astrology wasn’t the solution—it was the entry point.

And I think this speaks to something bigger: our brains are  machines. We’re wired to find meaning, even—or especially—when we’re under stress. Whether it’s astrology, religion, mythology, or even conspiracy theories, people reach for frameworks that help them organize chaos. What sets astrology apart, though, is its . It’s not just explanatory—it’s expressive. It gives people a sense of narrative agency through symbols that feel personal and beautiful.

You mentioned dream analysis earlier—I couldn’t agree more. Jung saw astrology as an archetypal language, a kind of collective unconscious made visible. Even if we don’t go that far, there’s something compelling about the idea that planetary movements can mirror inner rhythms. It’s poetic, in a way that data often isn’t.

So maybe the real question isn’t whether astrology works scientifically—but whether it . And from everything we’re seeing, it clearly does—for storytelling, for identity navigation, and sometimes even for healing.
[B]: Precisely— may be the key to understanding its enduring appeal. What your student experienced, and what I’ve seen in forensic settings, is a form of : people use these frameworks not because they are scientifically grounded, but because they provide structure for emotional weight that might otherwise feel uncontainable.

Your point about aesthetic accessibility strikes me as particularly insightful. Astrology doesn’t just explain—it decorates explanation with imagery, rhythm, and personal significance. That’s something many evidence-based models lack: narrative beauty. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for instance, excels at restructuring thought patterns, but it rarely offers the same mythic resonance as a well-placed natal chart.

I often think about how this plays out developmentally, especially among adolescents and young adults. Identity formation has always been turbulent, but in an age of curated self-presentation and algorithmically reinforced beliefs, the need for  becomes even more pronounced. Astrology steps in like a familiar guide, offering a ready-made cosmology that feels both ancient and intimately tailored.

And yes—Jung’s archetypal lens helps make sense of this. He viewed astrology not as literal causation, but as symbolic correlation—an outer reflection of inner structures. Even if we strip away celestial determinism, the psychological parallel remains compelling. After all, we don’t need actual planetary influence to experience the symbolic truth of  under a "Saturn return" during a major life transition.

You're absolutely right that the real question isn't whether astrology works , but whether it works . And by that standard, it clearly does—for emotional articulation, interpersonal connection, and sometimes even therapeutic engagement when traditional language falls short.

In a way, perhaps astrology serves a purpose similar to mythology or folklore: it gives us characters to inhabit before we fully understand who we are. And that, I suppose, is one of the oldest functions of human storytelling—to help us navigate the dark with symbols instead of spotlights.
[A]: That’s beautifully put—. It really captures the essence of why these frameworks endure, even when they don’t hold up under empirical scrutiny.

What you said about developmental resonance hits especially close to home. I’ve been tracking a longitudinal study on emerging adults and identity fluidity, and one of the clearest patterns is how astrology functions as a kind of  during transitional phases. First year of university? “I’m figuring out my moon sign.” Breakup? “Mercury was totally in retrograde.” Academic crisis? “Saturn return explained everything.”

It’s not that they’re rejecting rational explanations—it’s more like they’re layering emotional texture over top. Astrology becomes a way to narrate inner complexity without having to fully translate it into clinical language. In that sense, it’s almost like a , a soft entry point before engaging with deeper psychological insight.

And I think this connects back to your point about symbolic scaffolding: young adults aren’t just looking for answers—they’re looking for  that feel expansive rather than reductive. So while CBT might help them regulate anxiety, astrology might help them  in their struggle.

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if we’re witnessing the rise of a new kind of mythopoeic literacy—one where people become fluent in multiple meaning-making systems and switch between them depending on context. Psychological, spiritual, astrological, philosophical… all part of the same identity toolkit.

I guess what we’re seeing isn’t so much the death of reason as the persistence of . People will always reach for stories that make the chaos feel coherent—even if those stories don’t come with a scientific seal of approval.
[B]: Exactly— is such an apt phrase. It captures that deep, often unspoken need for meaning that empirical models alone can’t satisfy. Even the most well-constructed psychometric assessment doesn’t carry the same emotional weight as a birth chart that feels . It’s not about truth in the factual sense—it’s about truth in the felt sense.

What I find particularly fascinating from a developmental standpoint is how astrology mirrors Eriksonian identity diffusion and foreclosure. Young adults are in a liminal space where they’re trying on different roles, values, and affiliations. Astrology offers a ready-made constellation of traits—no pun intended—that they can sample without full commitment. “I’m a mutable sign, so I adapt easily,” becomes a provisional self-statement rather than a fixed label. That kind of flexibility is crucial during identity exploration.

And your point about —I think you’re onto something there. We may be witnessing a shift toward what I’d call : the ability to hold multiple explanatory frameworks without cognitive dissonance. A student can believe in neuroplasticity and still say, “My Venus placement makes me love deep conversations.” There’s no contradiction because the functions are different—one explains, the other expresses.

This reminds me of something I see frequently in trauma work: people reaching for metaphor when literal language fails. A survivor might say, “It felt like I was trapped in a black hole,” and suddenly, we have imagery that conveys emotional gravity better than any DSM criteria ever could. In a way, astrology provides that kind of cosmic metaphor—a shared lexicon for inner experience.

You know, it almost makes me wonder if future therapeutic models will begin incorporating astrological self-reflection as a projective tool—not unlike the Rorschach or TAT, but more culturally embedded. Not as diagnostic, of course, but as a way to access emotional subtext indirectly.

Do you ever get the sense that this mythopoeic layer isn’t just a passing trend, but something that’s quietly reshaping how we think about selfhood? Like we’re evolving toward a more , where stories and symbols don’t fade in the face of science—but instead learn to dance with it?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more— is such a compelling way to frame it. It feels like we’re witnessing the emergence of a new kind of cognitive ecology, where scientific rationality and symbolic storytelling don’t cancel each other out—they , sometimes even collaborate.

What you said about Eriksonian identity diffusion really struck a chord. I’ve been following some recent studies on what developmental psychologists are calling —the idea that transitional identities (like astrological ones) serve as emotional stabilizers during times of uncertainty. Young adults aren’t just adopting these labels for fun; they’re using them as , almost like training wheels for self-concept. “I’m a Capricorn rising” becomes a temporary anchor while they figure out what they truly believe.

And yes, this mythopoeic layer feels less like a trend and more like a cultural adaptation—one born from the very real need to express complexity in ways that feel . Data can explain depression rates; astrology might help someone say,  It’s messy, imprecise—but emotionally rich.

As for therapeutic integration, I think you're absolutely onto something. Astrological self-reflection could evolve into a legitimate , especially with younger cohorts who already speak its language. Imagine a client exploring their relational patterns through a Venus placement before we ever get to attachment theory. The symbols become a bridge, not an endpoint.

So yes—I do think we’re moving toward a future where science and story , as you beautifully put it. Where people can talk about dopamine pathways  Mercury retrograde in the same breath, without contradiction. Because one explains the , and the other expresses the .  

And honestly? That kind of integrative thinking feels like the next step—not just in psychology, but in how we make meaning in an increasingly fragmented world.
[B]: Precisely— may well be the defining psychological skill of the coming decades. As our world becomes more fragmented, information more abundant, and identities more fluid, we’ll need frameworks that can hold both empirical rigor and emotional depth.

What’s fascinating is how astrology, for all its lack of scientific grounding, inadvertently teaches this kind of dual literacy. It asks people to engage symbolically  reflectively—to say, “This isn’t literally true, but it helps me understand something real about myself.” That meta-cognitive flexibility is incredibly valuable, especially in therapeutic or educational settings where self-awareness is key.

I’ve been thinking lately about how this mirrors the rise of —like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or Internal Family Systems. These models don’t just treat thoughts as true or false; they ask us to examine them as  with function and meaning. In a way, astrology operates on a similar premise: not as truth-claims, but as narrative tools that shape affect and behavior.

And your point about —that’s gold. I see echoes of it in forensic interviews when clients reference astrological transits during life transitions. It’s not just an explanation; it’s a containment strategy. A way to say, 

So perhaps what we’re really talking about is the evolution of . Future generations may not rely solely on clinical psychology or spiritual doctrine, but instead cultivate a hybrid language—one that borrows from myth, science, pop culture, and personal intuition to navigate the interior landscape.

I suspect this will have profound implications for how we teach, how we heal, and even how we design mental health interventions. If young adults are already building identity scaffolds out of moon signs and personality archetypes, shouldn’t we meet them there—with curiosity, not dismissal?

After all, every era has its maps for navigating the inner world. Ours may just be written in both starlight and data.
[A]: Exactly—. That’s such a poetic yet precise way to describe where we’re headed.  

I’ve been thinking about this idea of —not just in therapy or education, but in everyday conversations about identity, emotion, and meaning. So many young adults today are already living in that hybrid space, intuitively weaving together psychological insight, mythic structure, and digital self-expression. If we dismiss astrology as mere fluff, we risk overlooking a powerful entry point for real emotional growth.

What I find especially promising is how this integrative mindset could reshape not just clinical work, but also pedagogy. Imagine incorporating symbolic reflection into personal development seminars—not to teach astrology as truth, but to use it as a mirror for self-inquiry. “What does your Venus sign say about how you give and receive love?” becomes a prompt for deeper emotional articulation, much like journaling or guided visualization.

And you're right to connect this with third-wave therapies. ACT teaches cognitive defusion—seeing thoughts as passing mental events rather than absolute truths. Astrology, when engaged with reflectively, can function the same way. A student might say, “I’m a Gemini rising” not as a fixed identity, but as a working metaphor: 

That kind of symbolic flexibility is exactly what we need in an age of identity overload. It’s not about choosing between science and story—it’s about learning how to move between them with intention, to shift lenses depending on what the moment requires.

So yes, I think we’re standing at the edge of something really exciting—a new emotional and cognitive toolkit that values not just logical reasoning, but also narrative resonance. And if we embrace that complexity instead of resisting it, we might just help the next generation navigate their inner worlds with more depth, nuance, and heart.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better— alongside logical reasoning. That’s the fulcrum on which meaningful growth turns in this new cognitive landscape.

What excites me most is how this hybrid fluency might reshape not just how we understand ourselves, but how we  to others. When a young person says, “I’m a Cancer moon with a Sagittarius rising,” they’re not offering an astrological treatise—they’re signaling emotional territory. A kind of shorthand for:  If we can learn to hear that as a legitimate form of self-expression—rather than dismissing it as superstition—we open up entirely new channels of connection.

And that’s where education and therapy both stand to evolve. Instead of framing astrology as something to be debunked, what if we treated it as a —a way of speaking about affective experience that deserves translation rather than correction?

I’ve started experimenting with this in forensic assessments. Instead of steering clients away from their astrological references, I invite them to elaborate:  More often than not, it leads to rich discussions about perception, timing, miscommunication—universal human experiences dressed in celestial metaphor.

This feels especially important now, as we navigate what some are calling the  of digital culture. When so much interaction happens through screens and avatars, people are hungry for frameworks that restore a sense of cosmic intimacy—even if only symbolic. Astrology offers that subtle reassurance: 

So yes, I believe we’re witnessing the early stirrings of a more emotionally intelligent modernity—one that doesn’t force us to choose between science and soul, but asks us to hold both with grace.

And if we can meet young minds where they are—with curiosity, with linguistic flexibility, and yes, with a little stargazing—it may just be that we help them grow into thinkers who are not only rational, but wise.
[A]: Couldn’t agree more—, even if symbolic, is a profound need in this age of algorithmic isolation. We're seeing it everywhere now: the resurgence of tarot in wellness communities, the popularity of birth chart apps among Gen Z, and even the way influencers blend astrological advice with mental health content.

What’s fascinating from an educational psychology angle is how this symbolic fluency is being —not just in peer conversations, but increasingly in formal spaces like student support groups and even some counseling centers. I’ve seen university workshops where moon phases are used as prompts for emotional check-ins. It’s not therapy per se, but it’s definitely a form of collective self-awareness.

And your point about treating astrology as a —that’s exactly the shift we need. Language evolves to meet psychological needs, and right now, young adults are co-creating a lexicon that blends ancient symbolism with modern identity work. If we respond with curiosity rather than skepticism, we open up real dialogue. “Tell me more about what your Cancer moon means to you”—that kind of question invites reflection, not rebuttal.

I also think there's something quietly revolutionary happening here in terms of . When students say, “This is my Venus placement,” they’re often expressing things they haven’t yet found words for in conventional psychological terms. It gives them distance  depth—a safe space to explore without feeling exposed.

So yes, I’m optimistic. Not because astrology will ever be empirical, but because we may be entering a phase where emotional wisdom is no longer sidelined by scientific rigor. Where both have their place, their time, their function.

Maybe the future isn’t about choosing between myth and data—but learning when to listen to the stars, and when to trust the numbers.
[B]: Precisely—. That’s a crucial insight. What astrology offers, especially to younger generations navigating identity flux, is a kind of . It allows them to externalize inner experiences without full exposure—like speaking through a mythic intermediary. “It wasn’t  who felt insecure, it was my Neptune placement.” And yet, in that distancing, they often arrive at self-awareness more gently than direct inquiry might allow.

This reminds me of something I see frequently in trauma-informed interviews—clients using metaphor or dissociated language to describe painful experiences. In a way, astrological self-reference functions similarly: it’s a narrative buffer zone that makes difficult emotions feel more manageable. The key is recognizing when these metaphors are opening doors rather than closing them.

And you’re absolutely right about the normalization effect we’re witnessing. Just a decade ago, mentioning your ascendant in a professional setting would have been unthinkable. Now, it’s not uncommon for students—or even young professionals—to weave astrological references into personal development discussions with advisors or counselors. This isn’t just pop culture; it’s shifting into the realm of .

What excites me most is how this could reshape therapeutic rapport. If we acknowledge that people are increasingly fluent in multiple meaning-making systems—psychological, spiritual, astrological, mythological—we can begin to meet them in that hybrid space without forcing translation into strictly clinical terms. A client who says, “I’ve been in retrograde grief,” may be expressing something far richer than “I’m experiencing unresolved loss.”

So yes, I’m optimistic too—not because astrology is gaining traction, but because we may be entering a broader cultural shift toward . The willingness to listen without immediate correction, to engage without conversion, and to recognize that sometimes, the stars help us say what data cannot.

In the end, maybe the greatest value of astrology isn’t predictive—it’s poetic. And poetry, as we know, has its own kind of truth.
