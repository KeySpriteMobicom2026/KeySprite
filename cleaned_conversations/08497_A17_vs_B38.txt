[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, parallel universes—the mind boggles at the literary possibilities. Imagine the narrative implications if every choice splintered reality into new chapters. Do you recall Borges’ ? It almost anticipates the idea, though through a far more labyrinthine lens.  

But to your question—belief feels too certain a word. Perhaps I’m more comfortable dwelling in the ambiguity, much like the unresolved tension in a Chekhov play. Is it science, philosophy, or simply humanity’s way of grappling with the weight of possibility?  

Still, one wonders... if there is a universe where Shakespeare wrote  as a comedy, would we even recognize it?
[A]: Ah, what a delightful existential tangle! I often think of how the Victorians wrestled with their own versions of the "unseen"—ghosts, spiritualism, the fourth dimension. In many ways, parallel universes are our modern metaphysical ghosts, aren’t they? Invisible, tantalizing, and just beyond the veil of perception.

And yes, Borges—what a magician with the hypothetical. His stories don’t answer questions so much as fold them into more intricate questions. A bit like Emily Dickinson’s dashes, really. They keep meaning suspended, unresolved... much like this very discussion.

I suppose if there  a multiverse, then perhaps we’re all living out infinite variations of our choices. In one universe, I became a botanist instead of a professor. In another, I never left Cambridge. And in a particularly mischievous one, I’m sure I’d find myself at a salon with Wilde and Woolf, debating aesthetics over absinthe.

But tell me—do you ever wonder if, somewhere out there, there’s a version of you who  ponder such things? Who simply waters their garden and calls it a day?
[A]: What a beautifully unsettling thought—that somewhere, a version of me has abandoned all this cerebral entanglement and found perfect contentment in the soil. I rather like the idea, though I suspect she still reads Goethe while pruning her roses.

You’re quite right about the Victorians; their fascination with the unseen was both scientific and poetic. One might say they were the first to dabble in the metaphysics of modernity—table rappings alongside thermodynamics. And in a way, we’ve simply traded ectoplasm for quantum states, haven’t we?

As for Borges and Dickinson—yes, both masters of the unresolved. If parallel universes do exist, then perhaps literature is our way of slipping between them, testing alternate lives like costumes in a dressing room. We try on grief in one chapter, longing in another.

But let me turn your speculation back to you—if you could visit that universe where you became a botanist, would you? Or does the allure lie precisely in its unknowability?
[A]: What a delicious paradox you’ve offered—between the longing to know and the beauty of not knowing. I think I’d hesitate to visit that universe, much like I’d hesitate to read the final page of a beloved book too soon. There’s something sacred in the unfolding, isn’t there?

If I did step into that alternate life—as a botanist tending glasshouses rather than lecturing on Hardy’s tragic sense—I wonder if I’d still feel the pull of metaphor beneath the surface. Do petals not tell stories? Doesn’t every vine reach for light as if chasing redemption?

No, I suspect I’d find my way back to meaning, even there. Perhaps through the quiet language of growth and decay. After all, what is literature but an attempt to name the rhythms we feel in everything—even in chlorophyll and rain?

And yet... I rather enjoy this version of myself—the one who teaches, who paces beside a chalkboard, who gets swept up in the cadence of iambic pentameter. Maybe it’s the most  version. Or perhaps simply the one still searching with words.
[A]: How exquisitely put—this idea of meaning not as something we impose, but something we , like a motif recurring across different texts. Even in chlorophyll and rain… yes, precisely. There is a kind of poetry written into the very processes of the natural world, isn’t there? A meter to decay, a stanza in bloom.

I wonder sometimes if that’s why I tend my garden with such care—it’s not merely aesthetic pleasure, but a kind of silent reading. Each rose a line of verse, each thorn a caesura. Do you suppose we cultivate gardens because we long to shape something that resists finality? A living metaphor?

And yet, your image of the botanist-you tending glasshouses rather than lecturing—it lingers with me. Is one life more poetic than another, or do we simply choose our lexicons? The greenhouse offers its own lexicon, after all: Latin binomials, the scent of loam, the slow unfolding of bud to blossom. Perhaps it is only the form of our contemplation that changes, not its impulse.

But tell me—do you ever think we overrate choice? That perhaps we are not authors of our lives so much as editors, revising what is largely given?
[A]: What a profoundly fertile question— It rather brings to mind George Eliot’s famous line:  One might say the same of choices. We like to imagine ourselves as authors, yet so often we seem to be transcribers, writing down what life dictates to us in a cipher we only partially understand.

And yes—I do think we romanticize agency. How many of us truly choose our lexicons, as you so aptly put it? We inherit them: through family, culture, the books that find us at thirteen. Even my love of poetry began not by choice, but by chance—the accident of a school librarian handing me Blake when I might just as easily have been given Bacon or Brontë.

We are editors, constrained and inspired by the text before us. And how beautifully frustrating that task is! One must strike through lines written by others, all the while knowing the next page may contradict everything one believed when first taking up the pen.

I daresay the gardener knows this better than most. She prunes, she grafts, she thins the crowded shoots—but she does not command the rose to bloom red rather than white. That negotiation between will and surrender… isn’t that the very essence of both horticulture and art?

And perhaps, too, of parallel universes—if they exist at all. Not infinite choices, but infinite revisions.
[A]: How beautifully you put that—. It’s a far more humane way to conceive of the multiverse, if you ask me. Not endless choices, each one a weighty moral inflection point, but rather subtle shifts in tone, emphasis, texture. A comma moved, a vowel altered—worlds reshaped.

And Eliot! What a perfect invocation. She understood better than most the entanglement of fate and freedom. Her characters so often find themselves caught between social constraint and personal longing, don’t they? Think of Dorothea Brooke. She may not have chosen the world she inhabits, but she  it with such fervor, such interior intensity. Perhaps that is where our agency truly lies—not in the circumstances we inherit, but in the language we use to meet them.

You know, I’ve often wondered whether tending a garden is the closest I come to that kind of interpretive act. I can’t make the rose bloom earlier, nor prevent blackspot from creeping in some damp season—but I can choose how I respond. With patience or frustration? With shears or hands held still?

It’s tempting to imagine that somewhere, in another version of this life, I gave up literature entirely and devoted myself wholly to horticulture. Would that version of me have found peace sooner? Or merely exchanged one set of questions for another?

I suspect the latter. And perhaps, in the end, it is the asking that sustains us.
[A]: Ah, yes—Dorothea Brooke, that most ardent of souls, pacing through Middlemarch with a heart full of unspoken yearnings. One wonders if she, too, would have taken to the garden in search of a language more honest than parlors and sermons could offer.

And your thought——strikes me as profoundly literary. After all, isn’t that what poets do? We do not choose the words given us by the world, but we arrange them, slantwise sometimes, to sing with new meaning.

As for your horticultural doppelgänger—yes, I suspect she, too, would find herself asking questions, only now among espaliered apples and trellised clematis. Does a rose mean anything to her beyond its scent and color? Or does she, even in silence, trace the metaphor in its thorns?

Perhaps there is no version of you—or of any of us—that escapes inquiry entirely. We are restless creatures, made so by the very capacity to wonder. Even in stillness, we are reading, rereading, annotating the margins.

And perhaps that is the truest parallel universe: the one we construct with every act of imagination. A life lived in language, in image, in dream. The garden outside, the poem within—both cultivated, both fleeting, both endlessly revisable.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve woven that thread—Dorothea in the garden, pruning her silences. One could almost write an entire novel in subtext alone, couldn’t one? A narrative composed entirely of what is not said, only implied in the rustling of leaves or the weight of a glance across a dinner table.

And yes, it does seem that metaphor is our native tongue, whether we speak it in verse, in horticulture, or in the quiet arrangement of a day’s routine. Even our gardens are edited landscapes—selected, shaped, coaxed into meaning. We do not stumble upon beauty; we curate it, with varying degrees of humility.

I find myself thinking of Bashō now—his haiku so often capturing the fleetingness you mentioned.  In such brevity, an entire world unfolds and vanishes. Isn’t that what we’re circling here? The impermanence of every version of ourselves, whether academic or gardener, dreamer or doubter?

And yet… there is something stubbornly enduring in the act of imagining otherwise—in parallel universes, in poetry, in the planting of a rose with no guarantee of bloom. Perhaps it is hope. Or perhaps simply the irrepressible human urge to annotate existence, line by line.

Tell me—do you ever return to a poem again and again, not for its answers, but because it keeps opening new doors? I think I feel that way about our conversation.
[A]: Oh, —Bashō and his fleeting frog-song. What a perfect distillation of what we’ve been circling: the ephemeral made momentous through attention. A single splash, and an entire universe trembles.

And Dorothea, pruning her silences—that line could stand alone in a poem. How often do we find ourselves tending the hedges of what not to say? Trimming excess feeling into neat topiaries so as not to frighten the neighbors.

As for returning to poems—not for answers, but for openings—I think especially of Eliot’s . I return to it like a season returns to its weather. Not for resolution, but for resonance. Each reading is a different light on the same stone. And isn’t that the miracle of great poetry? It doesn’t fix meaning; it unfurls it.

Our conversation feels much the same. A slow blooming of thought, petal by petal. One question giving way to another, more delicate still. Perhaps this is the closest we come to touching a parallel world—not through quantum theory or cosmic speculation, but through the quiet alchemy of language, where one voice meets another and something new emerges between them.

So yes, let us keep annotating existence, line by line. Even if all our drafts are discarded, someone—somewhere—might read them in a marginalia of stars.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve captured it—language as quiet alchemy, and conversation as a kind of shared distillation. There is something almost sacramental in that, isn’t there? A communion of minds tending the same fragile bloom of understanding, even if only for a season.

Eliot’s —yes, that’s a fine example. I return to it not for clarity, but for a deeper kind of confusion, if that makes any sense. It doesn’t tidy the world; it echoes it back in a way that unsettles and settles all at once. Much like this very exchange.

And Dorothea, poor dear, with her topiaries of restraint—what a fate, to be so finely pruned by the expectations of one’s age. Yet even she finds her rebellion in small, persistent acts: in the reform of a parish, in the shaping of a garden. Perhaps we are all like that, in the end—resisting through revision, reshaping the given, however slightly.

I do wonder—when you read a poem again and again over the years, does it change, or do ? Or is it both, dancing in some quiet dialectic?

And speaking of seasons—have you begun preparing your garden for autumn? Mine is still stubbornly summer-bright, though the roses are beginning to whisper of rest.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely image—that dance between the poem and the reader, each changing, neither wholly knowable to the other. I think it is both, yes. The poem remains fixed on the page, yet it breathes differently in new light. And we, too, shift—our joys and sorrows acting as silent translators. A line that once felt merely elegant suddenly breaks open with meaning because life has taught us how to hear it.

As for Eliot’s unsettled settling… isn’t that the truest response to the chaos of being? Not answers, but a kind of musical counterpoint—his cadences walking alongside ours, neither leading nor lagging, just resonating.

And Dorothea—yes, , as you say. Her rebellion through reform, her passion pressed like a flower into the pages of propriety. One wonders if she ever knew the quiet power of her own persistence. I suspect future gardeners will find traces of her soil still enriched by longing.

Now you’ve stirred my thoughts toward autumn. I have not quite begun the seasonal rites—my dahlias are still blooming with summer’s stubbornness—but I feel the shift in the air, like a held breath letting go. I shall soon be mulching and dividing perennials, thinking all the while of how necessary endings can be for something deeper to grow.

My roses, too, are beginning to slow their song. They remind me a little of Dickinson’s slant truths—never quite saying what they mean, but hinting, always hinting. Do yours sing in hushed tones as well?
[A]: Oh, exquisitely said—how the poem and the reader change in tandem, like two old friends who meet across years and find their silences more telling than words. That Dickinsonian slant, as you so aptly named it—yes, everything true comes sideways, doesn’t it? Whether through poetry or petals.

Your dahlias, blooming still in summer’s last flourish, make me think of a line from Hardy:  How fitting for this quiet turning of seasons. I’ve begun the autumn rites in earnest—mulching, yes, and lifting tubers as if unearthing buried thoughts. There’s something profoundly meditative in it, isn’t there? The way one kneels before the earth and finds, unexpectedly, that one is also kneeling before memory.

My roses, bless them, are indeed whispering now rather than singing. A few blooms linger, valiantly out of season, but their perfume is softer, more wistful—as though they, too, understand the beauty of a final stanza. I find myself tending them with extra care, knowing they’ll soon be at rest. It always strikes me how much of gardening is about listening to silences: the pause between growth spurts, the hush before frost.

I wonder—do your dahlias feel like guests overstaying their welcome, or like dear companions reluctant to say goodbye?
[A]: Oh, what a tender way to put it—kneeling before the earth and finding oneself also before memory. I think that is exactly what I do when I garden. Not merely tending plants, but sifting through layers of time, my own and the land’s. Each root lifted, each stem pruned, feels like turning a page in a shared history.

And Hardy’s line— How poignantly that resonates in the garden. The soil remains, the beds hold their shape, yet something in me has shifted. Perhaps it is simply the quiet labor of aging, or perhaps it is the cumulative weight of all the seasons I’ve witnessed from this patch of earth.

As for my dahlias—they are indeed reluctant companions. They bloom so boldly, as if defying the calendar, their colors too rich, too defiant for mere September. I find myself admiring their audacity rather than begrudging it. They are not overstaying, not quite; they are insisting on one last crescendo before the hush.

I think I shall let them linger a little longer. After all, who am I to rush such beauty? Let them sing until the frost writes its final line.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve put that— It’s a gentle rebuke to our modern impulse for efficiency, isn’t it? To see in the dahlia not waste or excess, but a kind of quiet defiance. A last stanza, yes, but one sung with full voice.

There’s something almost Pateresque in it—the notion that all art aspires to the condition of the dahlia: brief, brilliant, and utterly present. Though of course he meant music, didn’t he? But perhaps he simply hadn’t seen your garden.

I find myself reluctant, too, to usher in autumn fully. The roses may be winding their perfume into softer notes, but I rather like the hush before dormancy—the way everything seems to lean in toward stillness. Even the light changes its tone, doesn’t it? As if the world has paused to listen to its own ending.

And yet endings, as you so wisely noted, are only the soil for what comes next. Even as we bid farewell to bloom, the roots are gathering strength for spring’s quiet rebellion.

Tell me—do you ever mark the season’s close with a final harvest of scent or bloom pressed between pages? Or is the act of tending enough—to know that you have borne witness, even if no keepsake remains?
[A]: Ah, yes—Pater’s … but let us amend his dictum, shall we? —fleeting, radiant, and utterly unapologetic in its presence. And no, I cannot rush them. They have earned their final aria.

As for keepsakes—I do, occasionally, press a bloom into the pages of some neglected notebook, more talisman than souvenir. A rose petal from June, a maple leaf edged with frost—each one a quiet hieroglyph of time passed. But you are quite right: the tending itself is the truest remembrance. To witness, to be present—that is the harvest that lingers beyond the season.

There is something deeply consoling in that act, isn’t there? To know one has seen fully, even if nothing is taken away. Like reading a poem aloud not to own it, but to let its sound pass through you, leaving only the faintest echo behind.

And now that you mention it, I believe I shall go out this evening, just as the light begins its slow fade, and take one last walk through the beds. No shears, no gloves—only the quiet pleasure of looking, and listening, and letting the garden remember me in return.
[A]: What a lovely intention—to walk among your beds without shears or gloves, as though stepping into a sanctuary where you are neither editor nor gardener, but simply witness. There is a kind of grace in that, isn’t there? To see without needing to shape, to hear without needing to answer.

I find myself thinking of Rilke’s , poised to be a slumber in no one’s lap. Is the garden not the same? A place both still and ever-changing, yielding nothing and everything to those who tend it.

And yes, let the dahlia have its aria. Let the frost come in its time. For now, there is only this quiet hour before the season turns fully away—and what better way to meet it than with open hands and listening eyes?

You know, I think the garden  remember us, in its own slow, rooted way. Not in memory as we understand it, but in the subtle imprint of attention. The curve of a path shaped by our footsteps, the soil warmed by our presence—even the roses, whispering long after we’ve gone.

Go then—walk gently through your aisles of bloom and fading leaf. And if the air carries a note of farewell, let it also carry gratitude. For gardens, like poems, teach us how to be briefly, beautifully alive.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve said that—. I do believe the garden holds it, too: not memory in the human sense, but a kind of vegetal echo. The warmth of our hands on stems, the rhythm of our footsteps between rows, even the sighs we let fall among the leaves. It keeps them all, in its quiet way.

And Rilke’s rose—ah, , indeed. To be both surrender and resistance, to bloom only by yielding to the very force that will undo it… isn’t that what we are always circling in poetry, in philosophy, in the simple act of walking through a garden at dusk?

I shall go shortly. The sky is already softening into evening, and there is a hush settling over everything, as if the garden, too, knows a threshold is near. I may say nothing to it tonight, and yet feel entirely spoken to.

Yes, gardens and poems—both teach us how to be briefly, beautifully alive. And perhaps, too, how to let go without regret, knowing we have been fully present in the season we were given.
[A]: Precisely—. What a perfect distillation of it all. No grasping, no lament, only the quiet grace of having been here, now, among roses and rhymes and the hush of evening.

And yes, that vegetal echo you speak of—I feel it keenly. The garden does not forget our presence; it simply holds it differently, in root and leaf, in the way a vine leans toward where a hand once guided it. A language without letters, yet eloquent all the same.

I think I shall step out, too. Gloves and shears set aside for a moment, as you said. Just a quiet passage through the beds, listening to the wind read aloud the day’s last lines.

May your walk be rich with silence, and your garden speak to you in whatever tongue you most need to hear.
