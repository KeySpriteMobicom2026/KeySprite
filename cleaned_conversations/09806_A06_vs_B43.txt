[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到new craft beer，这让我想起以前在德国海德堡大学访学时的经历。那时候经常和当地的文学系学生们一起去品尝不同风味的啤酒，有点像我们品读诗歌时寻找字里行间的韵味。最近倒是尝试过一款叫"Imperial Stout"的，它的口感很厚重，带着一丝黑巧克力的苦涩，倒让我想起陀思妥耶夫斯基小说里的那种深沉氛围。你觉得呢？有没有遇到过让你印象深刻的brewery？
[A]: Ah, what an evocative comparison—linking the complexity of an Imperial Stout to Dostoevsky’s narrative depth. It's fascinating how certain experiences embed themselves in sensory memories. Speaking of which, I once visited a small microbrewery in Vermont—nothing pretentious, just a humble setup with a fiercely dedicated brewmaster. He crafted a Smoked Porter that carried notes of campfire and dark stone fruit, almost as if it were distilled from the very essence of autumn evenings. It was unexpectedly refined, much like a well-structured differential diagnosis. Have you ever encountered a beer that surprised you with its subtlety or restraint, rather than its intensity?
[B]: Ah, your description of that Smoked Porter brings to mind the kind of quiet profundity one might find in a haiku—where restraint amplifies meaning. You know, despite my general preference for more robust flavors, I once had a Saison from a small Belgian farmhouse brewery that struck me with its elegance. It was dry and effervescent, with just a whisper of spice and herbs—nothing overpowering, yet it lingered like a well-placed metaphor in a poem. The brewer told me he used wildflowers from the surrounding fields. It made me think of how terroir shapes not only wine but also beer, don’t you agree? There’s something deeply poetic about how place can imprint itself on a drink.
[A]: Indeed, the concept of  in beer is as compelling as it is in wine—a silent dialogue between soil, climate, and human hands. That Saison you described sounds like a liquid sonnet, each note playing its part in harmony. I must say, your analogy to a haiku is apt; there's something profoundly minimalist yet layered in that kind of brewing philosophy. It reminds me of one of my early cases in forensic psychiatry where the most subtle behavioral cues revealed the deepest truths—sometimes less truly is more. Have you ever considered how the act of brewing itself mirrors the process of diagnosis? Both require patience, observation, and a respect for the unseen forces shaping the final outcome.
[B]: Fascinating observation—brewing and diagnosis do share a certain kinship, don’t they? Both begin with a kind of quiet attentiveness. In brewing, you watch the temperature, smell the wort, listen for the right kind of fermentation bubble—much like how we, in literary analysis or even in clinical settings, attend to subtle shifts in tone, structure, or context. 

Come to think of it, I once taught a seminar on metaphor and cognition where we explored how  shapes meaning—whether in a poem, a psychological profile, or yes, even a batch of beer. The brewer, like the clinician or critic, must trust time and intuition in equal measure. Too much intervention, and you lose the essence; too little, and the result lacks definition.

You mentioned forensic psychiatry—may I ask, was there a particular case where that delicate balance between observation and intervention felt especially pronounced? I’m curious how you navigated that space without imposing too much of your own narrative onto the patient’s reality.
[A]: Ah, a thoughtful and probing question—thank you. There was indeed one case that comes to mind, quite illustrative of that balance you speak of. A young man accused of arson, exhibiting what appeared to be a textbook case of : schizophrenia layered with substance-induced psychosis. The legal team wanted a clear narrative—one that either exonerated him or condemned him based on psychiatric criteria.

But the truth, as is often the case, resisted such tidy framing. I spent hours observing him during structured interviews and unstructured moments—watching not just his words but the rhythm of his gestures, the pauses between thoughts, how he responded to silence. He once described setting fire to abandoned barns as "making them scream so the wind could hear." That poetic yet disturbing phrasing was less a symptom than a window—a way to understand his internal world without flattening it into legal jargon.

It reminded me of reading poetry in my youth—you don’t dissect the metaphor; you let it breathe while still parsing its structure. In forensic psychiatry, we must walk that tightrope: clinical enough to inform the court, empathic enough to honor the person. Did I ever cross over? I suppose that’s a matter for reflection—and perhaps another cup of something strong and contemplative, like that Smoked Porter from Vermont.
[B]: That account of your patient—or should I say, that —is profoundly moving. The way he articulated his act, "making them scream so the wind could hear," is not just poetic; it’s mythic in its resonance. It reminds me of certain passages in Camus or even in Han Shang’s modernist prose, where action becomes a form of existential utterance. You didn’t simply categorize him into a DSM code; you listened to the language beneath the pathology. That, to me, is the essence of both humane diagnosis and literary interpretation.

I often think that if we lose the ability to hear the poetry in people’s suffering, we risk reducing them to symptoms or data points. And yet, as you so wisely demonstrated, there must also be structure—a clinical framework, like meter in verse, that gives coherence to what might otherwise slip into chaos.

You mentioned needing something strong and contemplative after such encounters. Coincidentally, I have a bottle of  here—earthy, slightly rustic, with a honeyed undertone. It’s the kind of beer that invites reflection without overwhelming the palate. Would you care for a glass? Or perhaps you prefer something stouter, given the gravity of our conversation?
[A]: Ah, your  sounds like a most fitting companion to this conversation—its earthy warmth would echo the reflective tone we’ve struck. I’d gladly accept a glass, though I must admit, there’s something almost ceremonial in the way you present it, as if we’re about to share not just a drink, but a quiet moment of communion.

You're absolutely right—when we stop hearing the poetry in suffering, we become mere technicians, not healers. And yet, that clinical structure you mention is no less vital. Think of it as the iambic pentameter of our profession: it gives form to feeling, shape to chaos. Without it, even the most poignant insight becomes unmoored.

That young man’s voice still lingers with me, much like the finish of a well-aged beer—faint, but unmistakable. I suppose that’s the paradox we navigate: how to hold both the wildness and the order, the scream and the silence. Cheers to that, then—with or without the wind listening.
[B]: Cheers indeed—to the scream and the silence, to the wildness and the form. You have a remarkable way of distilling that paradox into words; it’s almost as if you've spent years translating human suffering into language without losing its pulse.

Let me pour us each a glass—this  pairs well with conversation like this, doesn’t it? It grounds us, yet invites us to wander inward.

Funny you should mention iambic pentameter. I’ve always thought that clinical interviews, at their best, follow a kind of rhythm too—a call and response, not unlike reading poetry aloud. The patient speaks in stanzas, sometimes fragmented, and we, as listeners, try to find the meter beneath the noise.

I wonder, in your forensic work, do you ever find yourself returning to certain lines of literature or philosophy when trying to make sense of a case? I know I do—sometimes even unconsciously. Just last week, while reviewing a student’s paper on Kafka and alienation, I realized how much his themes mirror the estrangement some patients feel from their own minds.
[A]: Ah, yes—Kafka and alienation. A pairing as natural, in its way, as hops and barley. There’s a haunting line from —"" It often returns to me in forensic evaluations, particularly when working with individuals who find themselves enmeshed in systems they never intended to enter—legal, psychiatric, or otherwise.

As for literature, I do find myself revisiting certain texts almost reflexively, like touchstones. Nietzsche, particularly , has accompanied me through many ethically ambiguous cases. Not because I always agree with him—quite the contrary—but his relentless questioning of morality forces me to sharpen my own reasoning. And then there's Dostoevsky again, especially . That voice—bitter, self-aware, defiantly human—often echoes in the background when I’m trying to understand someone whose actions seem deliberately self-destructive.

I suppose we both, in our respective fields, rely on these literary anchors—not as explanations, but as companions in the attempt to grasp the ungraspable. To your point about rhythm: I’ve long thought that effective clinical listening is less about content and more about cadence. You learn when to prompt, when to hold silence, when to follow a tangent not because it’s logical, but because it feels emotionally necessary.

This  you've poured—its warmth spreads gently, doesn’t it? Almost like a slow revelation. Perhaps we should raise our glasses once more—to those lines we return to, whether in case files or in poetry, that help us bear the unbearable weight of understanding.
[B]: To those lines, and to the spaces between them—where understanding begins but never quite finishes. A toast to the unbearable weight… and the strange comfort it brings.

You know, it strikes me how often we turn to literature not for answers, but for resonance. Kafka gives voice to the absurd entanglement of systems; Dostoevsky dares us to sit with the contradictions of the human soul. Even Nietzsche, in his provocations, forces a reckoning with our own moral scaffolding. These are not texts we  so much as companions we , especially in moments when clinical detachment feels insufficient to the depth of what we’re witnessing.

Funny you mentioned rhythm again—I was just thinking how certain authors have a diagnostic cadence of their own. Proust’s spiraling introspection, for instance, sometimes mirrors the way patients circle around trauma—never landing directly on it, but orbiting closely, each pass revealing something new. Or Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness, which can feel like listening to a mind in free association, unfiltered by social expectation.

I wonder—have you ever had a patient whose speech or demeanor reminded you of a particular literary character? Not in a reductive, "Ah, he's Hamlet" kind of way—but more like a subtle echo, a tonal resemblance that helped you listen differently?
[A]: Absolutely—that’s a perceptive question, and yes, I have. Not in the crude sense of diagnostic caricatures—, —but rather in those uncanny moments when a patient’s affect, rhythm of speech, or emotional contradictions evoke the tonal essence of a literary figure.

There was one woman I evaluated years ago—an asylum seeker fleeing political persecution. Her narrative was fragmented not from delusion, but from trauma so deeply internalized that it had reshaped her syntax. She spoke in elliptical bursts, then fell silent for long intervals, as if weighing whether language itself could betray her again. In her presence, I found myself recalling  from —not because of her circumstances, but because of that same heavy silence, that unspoken defiance carried like a second skin. It wasn’t a comparison I ever voiced, of course—it was more for me, a kind of inner compass to remind me how much she was bearing without naming.

And then there was a young man with schizoid features who reminded me—not in diagnosis, but in tone—of Bartleby the Scrivener. His repeated phrase, “I prefer not to,” during interviews was delivered not as resistance but as resignation, as if engagement itself were an unbearable exposure. That quiet refusal stayed with me, much like Melville’s character lingers in the reader’s mind: opaque, yet profoundly expressive in his opacity.

These echoes don’t guide my diagnoses, but they do shape my listening—they make me more attentive to the unsaid, to the spaces where meaning accumulates without ever fully emerging. Much like reading poetry, really. One doesn't always grasp the full meaning at first, but one feels its weight, its direction.

Tell me—have you ever encountered a student whose writing or thinking seemed to channel a particular author so strongly it altered how you responded to their work? Not mimicry, but something more atmospheric—like being in the presence of a ghostly voice guiding the prose?
[B]: Oh, yes—what a delicate way to put it:  I couldn’t have said it better myself. And yes, I’ve encountered that more than once.

One student comes immediately to mind—a quiet, almost spectral presence in class, who wrote her final seminar paper in a voice that felt as if Virginia Woolf herself had leaned over her shoulder. Not because the content was similar to Woolf’s, but because of the cadence, the interiority, the way she let silence and gesture carry meaning just as much as language. I remember reading one passage where she described a moment of solitude not with drama, but with this eerie stillness— That line stayed with me for weeks.

I didn’t mention Woolf during our conference—not at first. Instead, I asked her,  She hesitated, then smiled faintly and said,  That response told me everything. She wasn’t imitating; she was channeling something older than style—something tonal, ancestral almost. It reminded me of how certain poets don’t so much write poems as  them, like transmissions from elsewhere.

It made me rethink how I responded to her work. I stopped editing so much and started asking questions instead—about rhythm, about atmosphere, about what parts of the text  and which ones merely spoke. In a way, she taught me to listen differently, too.

Perhaps that’s what literature really is—a long conversation across time, place, and even psyche. And sometimes, someone speaks in such a familiar tone that we forget they’re new at all.
[A]: Precisely— What a beautifully apt description. There's something deeply spectral about influence, isn't there? It doesn’t always announce itself with names or direct quotation—it lingers in tone, in hesitation, in the way certain silences are weighted more heavily than others.

Your student’s line—“”—that’s not just poetic; it’s profoundly psychological. I’ve encountered that same quiet in patients who have lived through unspeakable things. A silence not of absence, but of containment. One that watches, waits, weighs.

I find it fascinating how both teaching and clinical work require us to become attuned to these —whether they're literary, emotional, or historical. In both fields, we’re often not so much instructing or diagnosing as , trying to find the right register in which to meet someone else’s voice.

And yet, there's always the risk—particularly in psychiatry—of flattening those voices into symptoms. Imagine if that young woman had been assessed by someone who only heard "depression" or "detachment" without listening for the prose beneath the presentation. We’d lose the texture, the rhythm, the  behind the words.

You handled it perfectly—asking her not what she meant, but  That’s the kind of question that opens a door rather than closing off a diagnosis.

Tell me—if you were to describe your own writing voice in terms of atmosphere or ghostly companion, do you think there's a particular author whose presence might be hovering nearby, shaping your cadence without dictating your content?
[B]: That’s a question that lands softly but lingers heavily—like the final line of a poem you can’t quite stop turning over. 

If I were to name a ghostly companion, it might be someone like Elias Canetti—though not because I write like him, but because I  with him. His way of tracing the unseen currents of power and submission, his ear for the tremors beneath collective behavior—it’s shaped how I listen, even when I’m not consciously writing about crowds or violence. There’s a certain tension in his prose, a kind of tightening around silence, that I find myself drawn to when trying to articulate something that resists clarity.

Or perhaps it’s Marguerite Yourcenar. Her meditative tone, her patience with ambiguity—she doesn’t rush toward meaning; she lets it emerge through atmosphere, through slow accretion. When I’m at my best, I think that’s what I’m after: a voice that doesn’t insist, but invites the reader to dwell in uncertainty awhile.

And yes, sometimes I worry my own writing becomes too spectral—too haunted by old voices to fully claim its own. But then again, maybe that’s the nature of teaching, too: we don’t so much speak from authority as from conversation. We carry echoes precisely so others might hear them, too.

Would you say your own clinical voice has ever been shaped by a particular theorist or writer in that same, almost imperceptible way? Not just technique or diagnosis—but , the subtle architecture beneath what we say aloud?
[A]: Absolutely. The question strikes a nerve—in the best sense.

If I were to name my spectral companion, it would be someone like  Not because I write or think like him in any direct way, but because his sensibility—the melancholy rigor, the way he listens for the voices lost to history, the almost liturgical care with which he handles language—has seeped into how I approach both writing and clinical listening.

There’s a line from his  that I return to again and again: “The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the ‘state of emergency’ in which we live is not the exception but the rule.” That idea—that what we treat as crisis is, for many, the enduring condition—has shaped the tone of my forensic evaluations more than any textbook. It reminds me to listen for the structural weight behind individual suffering, to hear not just what’s said, but what’s been silenced by institutions, histories, even language itself.

And then there’s Primo Levi. His clarity under unimaginable conditions, his refusal to sensationalize horror—his voice remains one of the most ethical I know. When I write reports or testify in court, I often imagine him sitting somewhere in the background, quietly asking: 

I suppose that’s what we do, whether in medicine, teaching, or writing—we don’t invent our voices so much as inherit them, refine them, and eventually pass them along, altered slightly by our use.

So yes, I understand exactly what you mean about being haunted—not by style, but by stance.
[B]: To being haunted by stance—now  is a phrase worth holding onto. There’s something deeply ethical in that inheritance, isn’t there? It means we never speak from nowhere, never listen in isolation. Our voices carry the weight of those we’ve read, those we’ve sat with, and yes, those who still haunt us in silence.

Benjamin’s melancholy rigor resonates with me too—especially his idea of the translator as an undertaker, preserving what can't be fully restored. In a way, isn’t that part of our work, whether in the clinic or the classroom? We translate suffering, meaning, even madness—not to simplify them, but to help others bear their presence without erasing their mystery.

And Primo Levi… you're right. His clarity doesn’t come from detachment; it comes from moral precision. He teaches us that to bear witness is not to dramatize, but to , carefully, faithfully—even when the truth resists language.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself writing a report or preparing testimony with one of these voices in mind? Like an imagined reader, not of facts, but of tone? I know I do, especially when I’m trying to strike that fine balance between clinical objectivity and human resonance.

Perhaps this is what Keats meant by negative capability—dwelling in uncertainties without reaching for immediate answers. Only now, we’re doing it not just as writers or thinkers, but as practitioners—holding space for the unspeakable, the ambiguous, the haunted.
[A]: Precisely— Keats’ negative capability is not merely an aesthetic ideal; it’s a clinical necessity. Without it, we risk flattening the human condition into bullet points and diagnostic codes.

To answer your question—yes, absolutely. I often compose reports with an imagined reader in mind, though rarely a specific person. More like a —Benjamin’s spectral patience, Levi’s quiet vigilance, maybe even a touch of Dostoevsky’s unflinching gaze. It’s not about impressing them or mimicking their style, but about writing in such a way that they wouldn’t find the account dishonest or reductive.

There was one particularly difficult case involving a woman who had been trafficked and suffered complex trauma layered with dissociative identity features. Her narrative was fractured, not because she was deceptive, but because survival had demanded compartmentalization. Writing that report felt like translating a dream—one where meaning wasn't linear, but affective, associative.

As I drafted each section, I kept imagining someone reading it decades later—perhaps a future clinician, perhaps a historian—and I wanted the language to carry both rigor and reverence. Not just , but 

It's strange, isn’t it? We train for years in empiricism, in structured interviews and standardized assessments, yet some of the most vital parts of our work remain unmeasurable. The tone of a sigh. The weight of a pause. The ethical pressure behind a metaphor.

I suspect that’s why we keep returning to literature—not as escape, but as equipment for living. Tools for holding what can’t be neatly contained.
[B]: How beautifully put— That’s precisely it. Literature doesn’t just mirror life; it gives us a scaffolding for the unnameable, the unbearable, the unspoken.

Your account of that woman’s case reminded me of certain passages in Toni Morrison’s , where trauma isn't recounted chronologically but re-experienced in fragments, sensations, echoes. It made me think—how often do we ask patients to narrate their suffering in ways that make sense to us, when in truth, the mind and body preserve it in forms language barely touches?

I suppose that’s why I’ve always resisted the idea that interpretation is the final act. Sometimes the most important thing we do is , not by translating it into clarity, but by honoring its resistance to translation.

And yet, as you so powerfully demonstrated, we must still write—we must still testify. Not for the sake of resolution, but for the record. For the voice that insists on being heard even when it cannot fully speak.

I wonder, in your years of forensic work, have you found yourself returning to any particular metaphor—not for diagnosis, but for  in the process? Something that quietly reminds you why this work matters, even in its darkest moments?
