[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's quite a fascinating topic, isn't it? I must say, the idea of immortality has always intrigued me, especially after reading some rather thought-provoking stories during my travels. Do you think technology will ever reach a point where we could genuinely extend life indefinitely? I've met guests who've shared such interesting perspectives on this...
[A]: Well, if we consider the rapid advancements in gene editing and regenerative medicine, it's not entirely implausible that we might see significant life extension in the future. 技术奇点这个概念其实给我们提供了很多想象空间，但关键在于——我们是否应该这么做？伦理学家和生物学家之间对此一直存在争议。你遇到的那些客人持哪些有趣观点呢？我很想听听不同角度的看法 😊
[B]: Oh, you’ve touched on such a crucial debate—the "should" versus the "could." It’s something many of my guests wrestle with, especially over a glass of wine by the fireplace.  

One gentleman from Berlin believed extending life was humanity’s next evolutionary step, much like vaccines were centuries ago. He argued that if we can cure diseases, why not aging itself? But then there was a bioethicist from Singapore who worried about inequality—if only the wealthy could afford immortality, it would deepen societal divides.  

Perhaps my favorite conversation was with an elderly poet from Florence. She said, “Why chase endless years when it’s the finiteness of life that makes every moment precious?” Quite poetic, don’t you think?  

I must ask—where do you stand? Are you more drawn to the science, or wary of the consequences?
[A]: 你提到的这些观点真的都很深刻，特别是那位佛罗伦萨诗人的那句话——“生命的珍贵恰恰在于它的有限性。”这句话让我想起中文里常说的“物以稀为贵”，其实时间又何尝不是如此呢？⏳

从学术角度来看，我对这议题是既着迷又警惕。语言和文化塑造了我们对死亡的理解，比如在某些传统中，死亡被视为轮回的一部分；而在科技驱动的社会，死亡则被看作可以攻克的“问题”。这种认知上的差异，让讨论变得更加复杂。

至于我个人立场嘛……可以说是站在中间地带吧。我相信科学有潜力改善生活质量，比如延长健康寿命、减少老年疾病带来的痛苦。但这并不意味着我们应该追求永生 immortal life，尤其是当它可能加剧社会不平等或改变人类生态平衡时。

我很好奇——你在旅途中听过这么多不同的声音，你自己有没有慢慢形成某种倾向？还是说你更喜欢像诗人那样，把这个问题留给哲学去温柔地消化？
[B]: Your reflection is beautifully put—yes, time does gain its value because it’s finite. I often think of that line when tending to my garden. The seasons change, the flowers bloom and fade, and yet each spring feels precious because it isn’t endless.

As for where I stand… I suppose I’ve developed a quiet leaning toward the poet’s view, though not entirely out of romanticism. There's something deeply human about our awareness of an ending—it gives us urgency, purpose, even tenderness. But I also admire the drive to ease suffering. If science can help people live healthier, fuller lives until their time comes, I see that as a kind of grace.

Still, I worry about what immortality might cost us culturally. So many traditions, so much art and literature, are rooted in the acceptance of mortality. Would we lose a part of our soul by trying to outrun death?

That said, I don't claim to have the answer—I prefer to keep listening, learning, and perhaps one day, sharing these stories in a book of my own. After all, isn't that what travel and conversation teach us? That the journey matters more than the destination?
[A]: 你说到“季节的更替”和“花园里的春天”，让我想起一句中文诗：“年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同。”这种循环中的变化，正是生命动人的地方。而你愿意把这些对话写成一本书，我觉得非常美好，像是把旅途中的思想碎片编织成一张意义之网。

你说你倾向那位诗人的观点，但不是出于浪漫主义，而是出于对人性本质的理解——那种“知道终点存在”的紧迫感，的确塑造了我们的情感深度与创造力。如果死亡不再是终点，我们的爱、牺牲、记忆，甚至语言本身，会不会也跟着改变？这让我想到一个语言学上的类比：如果“短暂”这个词失去了意义，那“永恒”是不是也会变得空洞？

也许真正的immortality不在于延长个体的生命，而在于我们如何将故事、思想与情感传承下去。就像你现在所做的那样。

我很期待你的书 📖——或许它本身就是一种温柔的不朽。
[B]: What a truly moving way to put it…  —perhaps that’s why I’ve always felt drawn to stories more than any one ideology. If “transience” were to vanish from our vocabulary, as you so poetically suggest, then “eternity” would indeed ring hollow. Words lose their soul without their contrasts.

I often think of my grandmother, who used to keep a small notebook by her bedside. Every evening, she’d write down a memory, a phrase someone said, even the scent of rain on pavement. She never called it a diary—she called it her “little boat,” as if each entry could float beyond her and reach someone else someday.

Maybe that’s what we’re doing here—building little boats out of conversations. Yours is already sailing further than you might know.

And thank you… yes, I do hope my book becomes something like that: not a grand statement, but a quiet gathering of voices, like lanterns in a garden at dusk—each one flickering with its own brief, beautiful light.
[A]: Your grandmother’s “little boat”… what a tender way to think about memory and legacy. It reminds me of the Chinese saying, 一叶知秋 — , "from one leaf, you know autumn has arrived." A single memory, a brief phrase, can carry an entire world within it.

I think we’re both collectors of these leaves, aren’t we? You with your lanterns in the dusk, and me with my notebooks filled with scribbles from cafés in Paris, Taipei, and Buenos Aires. Each voice we gather is like that leaf—fragile, fleeting, yet full of meaning.

Maybe immortality isn’t about living forever as individuals, but about becoming part of that endless current of stories, flowing from one heart to another 🌊

And who knows—perhaps someday, someone will find your book on a quiet shelf, open it, and feel just a little less alone. Isn’t that a kind of eternity worth chasing?
[B]: You’ve said it so perfectly—I’m almost at a loss for words, which doesn’t happen often!   

Yes, we are collectors of leaves, you and I. And isn't it funny how the most ordinary moments—the steam rising from a cup of tea, the sound of footsteps on cobblestone, the way someone folds a napkin—can become the most enduring pieces of a life?

I remember one guest, an elderly calligrapher from Kyoto, once wrote a single character in ink and let it dry in the sunlight: 流 (liú), meaning "to flow." He told me, “This is all we are—something passing, yet never truly gone.” I’ve never forgotten that.

So if my book can be even a ripple in that stream—if it can quietly reach someone who needs to hear these voices, or feel seen in some small way—then yes, that’s the only kind of eternity I’d ever want to be part of.

Tell me—have you ever written down a conversation like this, just to keep its spirit alive? Or do you let them drift like paper boats, hoping they find the right hands?
[A]: Oh, I love that image—paper boats drifting downstream, carrying whispers of thought. 🌿  
I used to tell myself that my notebooks were for study, but really… they’re filled with fragments like this: a sentence overheard in a Taipei teahouse, the way a student once described dreaming in two languages, a metaphor a poet shared with me under a Kyoto moon.  

I do write them down, yes—but not to hold them too tightly. More like casting seeds into the wind, hoping some will land where they’re needed. Sometimes I revisit those pages and find meaning I didn’t see before; other times, the words take on new life in a lecture or an essay.  

But the act itself—捕捉那些稍纵即逝的瞬间，像捧住一缕晨雾——本身就是一种 kind of reverence, don’t you think?  

And now here we are, adding one more ripple to the stream.  
Thank you for this conversation—it’s already found its way into my notebook 😊
[B]: Oh, that’s such a lovely way to put it—捕捉那些稍纵即逝的瞬间, like trying to hold the morning mist... Yes, there’s real reverence in that act, isn’t there? Not for possession, but for recognition. A quiet bow to the moment before it moves on.

I think that’s why I’ve always loved hosting conversations like this—whether over tea with a traveler or exchanging stories with someone like you. It’s not just about remembering; it’s about honoring the flow, the rhythm of passing things.

And now my little notebook has a new entry too—your words about paper boats and seeds in the wind. I’ll carry them with me, as I’m sure you’ll carry this conversation forward in your own way.

So thank  for adding your voice to the stream. Who knows where it will ripple next? Perhaps that’s the beauty of it all—we never really know where our words land, only that they do.
[A]: Exactly—我们无法预知这些话语会激起怎样的涟漪，但它们一定会落 somewhere。也许是在某个深夜，一个陌生人偶然翻到这一页，心中忽然泛起一丝共鸣；又或者，像你说的那样，只是静静地成为流动中的一部分，不求永恒，只在当下轻轻闪现。

这种不确定性，反而让一切更显得珍贵，不是吗？就像那位京都书法家写的“流”——我们不过是随流而行，却也在无形中塑造着这条河的形状。

谢谢你，让我也成为你书页里的一行字。期待有一天，在你的书中，我能再次听见这些声音回响，如同秋叶间漏下的阳光，温柔而熟悉 😊
[B]: You’ve captured it so beautifully—yes, that uncertainty is part of what makes these moments so tender. If we knew exactly where our words were going, maybe they’d lose some of their quiet magic, don’t you think? Like knowing the exact moment a leaf will fall—it’s the not-knowing that makes us pause and notice.

I’m truly grateful to have shared this with you. You’ve given me a new way to see the current we’re all drifting in, and I’ll write about it with the kind of care reserved for autumn light through trees—soft, golden, and fleeting.

And yes… you're already there, in the pages of my thoughts, and one day, in the quiet space between the lines of my book. Should you ever feel like sending another ripple downstream, you know where to find me.

Until then, safe travels—on paper, on foot, and in conversation 🌿📖
[A]: 秋光般温柔的 care ——这大概是我能想到最美的写作姿态了。你让我想起另一个中文词：留白。有时候，正是那些未说尽的部分，才让文字有了呼吸的空间，也让读者能在其中放入自己的故事。

你说“不知道落笔何处”的那种 magic，其实不也正是我们继续书写、继续对话的理由吗？像是在信封上写下“寄往未知”，却依然相信它会抵达某个对的人手中。

谢谢你用这些意象装点了今晚的对话 🌙——我会带着它们继续前行，在某张咖啡馆的纸巾上，在某本泛黄的笔记本里，在下一次与人的相遇中。

而当你书中的字句最终汇成一条河，请记得我也会在岸边轻轻放一艘小船，载着几句从你这里借来的晨雾和星光 ✨

Safe travels to you too—on paper, on foot，也在梦里。
[B]: Oh…  —“留白.” What a perfect word, a perfect idea. How beautiful that you brought it here. There’s something so graceful about leaving space for silence, for the unspoken, for the reader to step in and make it their own.

And yes—writing "to an unknown address," yet believing, somehow, it will find its way. I think that’s the most hopeful thing we can do—to trust the current, to believe in quiet miracles.

I’ll keep your image close—that little boat with borrowed mist and starlight. Perhaps one day, when my book is finally finished and I sit by the water with a cup of tea, I’ll see it drifting toward me, carrying back your voice.

Until then, I’ll be writing into the white spaces, listening for ripples, and imagining your paper boats sailing gently on.

Sleep well—on paper, on foot, and in dreams 🌙📖✨
[A]: 你描述的那个画面，真的好温柔——坐在水边读一本书，看小船载着往日的对话漂回来。或许到那时，晨雾已散，但星光依旧在杯中轻轻摇晃 🌟

“留白”的魅力就在于此吧：它不说尽一切，却让一切都变得完整。就像此刻，我仿佛看见我们的文字在空中划出一道看不见的轨迹，像候鸟记得归途般，终会落在某个恰好的地方。

愿你的笔尖永远带着秋阳的温度，也愿你常在空白处听见无声的回响。

而我，也会在这里，在某一页咖啡渍斑驳的稿纸上，在某个突然想起“流”字的瞬间，继续放舟前行。

夜深了，晚安 🌙  
在纸页间，在步履中，在所有未完的对话里。
[B]: Oh… what a perfect closing image—you with coffee-stained pages, sudden recollections of the word 流, and paper boats gliding forward in the dark like quiet thoughts finding their way.

Your words tonight have been like lanterns—soft, warm, and just enough light to see the next step by. I’ll carry them with me, as I’m sure you will too, in your own gentle way.

And yes, let us both keep writing into that空白—the space where meaning begins again, where silence speaks, and where every unspoken word still lingers with possibility.

Goodnight, my fellow collector of leaves and ripples 🌿🖋  
In ink, in memory, and in all the conversations still waiting to find us.
[A]: 你这么说，我仿佛真的看见那些咖啡渍变成了地图上的河流，每一圈涟漪都是某次深夜对话的印记 🌊  
而我们这些collector of whispers，不过是借着星光，在纸页上留下些许痕迹。

“留白”不只是空白，而是留给未来的一封信——等待某个陌生或熟悉的灵魂，在那里写下自己的回声。

晚安，亲爱的朋友 🌙  
愿你的梦里有笔尖未曾写尽的故事，也有尚未说出却已被听见的声音。

在墨水里，在呼吸间，在所有静静流淌的时刻。
[B]: Oh…  —your words have painted a world where coffee rings are maps, and every ripple is a remembered voice. What a beautiful way to see the page—not as empty space, but as an invitation.

Yes, “留白” is more than silence; it’s a letter waiting to be answered, a breath held between heartbeats. And we, these quiet collectors of whispers, simply leave our marks like feathers on water—barely a disturbance, yet enough to make a ripple.

I hope my dreams tonight carry the weight of unwritten stories and voices not yet spoken aloud. But I already know yours will find their way in, soft and sure, like autumn leaves settling into place.

Goodnight, dear friend 🌙  
In ink that flows like riverlight,  
In hushed moments that stretch like paper under a gentle hand,  
And in all the spaces where silence speaks loudest.
