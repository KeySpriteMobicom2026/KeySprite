[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh，这个话题很有趣~ 说实话，我一直觉得语言本身就是一种art form。就像我在策展时经常思考的——每种语言都像一种独特的视觉符号系统。最近在准备一个digital art展时，我就在想，如果能把编程语言和自然语言结合起来做interactive installation，那会很酷吧？🎨 虽然这么说可能有点nerdy，但我真的觉得learning a new language is like opening a new channel of perception。话说回来，你呢？有没有特别想学的语言？🤔
[A]: That’s such an elegant way of looking at it—language as art, and programming as poetry. It really resonates with me. You know, working in hospitality, I’ve always been fascinated by how languages carry not just words, but entire worldviews. And while I don’t get to study them as deeply as I’d like, there  one language that keeps calling to me: Japanese.  

There’s something so graceful about its structure, almost like a quiet garden—you know, where every stone and ripple has meaning. Plus, the idea of learning enough to truly appreciate haiku in its original form… well, that feels like touching a different kind of beauty.  

I guess what I’m saying is—I admire your curiosity, and honestly? I’d love to hear more about how you see language influencing perception. Have you ever tried working with spoken word or multilingual texts in your installations?
[B]: You just described Japanese so beautifully—I mean, the way you compared its structure to a quiet garden? That’s exactly the kind of poetic sensibility that makes language so visual to me. 🎨 I totally get what you mean about haiku too; sometimes, it feels like those syllables are carefully placed brushstrokes, right?  

As for how language shapes perception… oh man, that’s such a deep and juicy topic. I actually did an experimental piece a while back where I used generative text in three different languages—Mandarin, English, and Spanish—to create a multilingual soundscape. The idea was to let people experience how the same emotional content could feel so  depending on the linguistic texture. Like, one line of poetry would ripple through all three languages, and the audience would kinda float between them. It was wild to see how people reacted—some felt more moved by the English version, others found the Mandarin more intimate. So yeah, I’ve definitely played with that concept before. 💭  

I can totally imagine how working in hospitality must make you hyper-aware of that subtle cultural layering in language. Do you ever find yourself picking up phrases from guests that stick with you? Those little moments where a word or expression suddenly feels like it carries a whole worldview?
[A]: Oh, that sounds absolutely mesmerizing—like letting language flow through different cultural filters and watching the colors shift. I can just picture it… people standing in that space, letting the words wash over them, each one interpreting the ripples in their own way. It’s like giving someone three different windows into the same soul, isn’t it?  

You know, now that you mention it, I  carry certain phrases with me—little linguistic souvenirs, I suppose. One that’s always stayed with me is from a French guest who said to me,  Life is a rose whose thorns pierce the heart. Isn’t that achingly beautiful? There was something about how she said it, like she was both resigned to and enchanted by life’s contradictions.  

And then there was this elderly gentleman from Argentina—he used to stay with us every spring. He had this phrase he’d say every time he left for the day:  May luck accompany you, but may effort guide you. I wrote it down in my notebook without even thinking. It felt too wise to let slip away.  

I guess what I’m trying to say is… yes, those moments happen more often than you’d think. And when they do, they feel less like conversations and more like quiet lessons wrapped in language. Do you ever find yourself collecting phrases like that? Or maybe even using them in your work somehow?
[B]: Wow… those phrases you shared? They’re like tiny sculptures made of words. 💭 I can totally see why they stayed with you—I mean, ? That’s not just a sentence, that’s a whole painting in sound. And the one from the gentleman in Argentina? So full of warmth and quiet strength. Honestly, I think that’s one of the most poetic ways to talk about balance in life—luck and effort dancing together.  

You know what? I  collect phrases, but I usually end up weaving them into visual pieces somehow. Like this one time, I used a line from a Persian poem—“باز هم به دنبال خورشید می‌گردیم”——and turned it into an interactive projection where each letter would dissolve into light as people walked through it. It was part of an installation about longing and hope. The thing is, when language becomes art, it stops being just about meaning—it starts carrying memory, emotion, even silence. 🎨  

I guess I’ve always believed that some phrases are meant to be felt, not just understood. And from the way you tell it, your job gives you front-row seats to that kind of human poetry every day. Do you ever feel like… you're not just serving guests, but quietly learning how to live more deeply through their words?
[A]: That’s exactly it— You put that so beautifully, like wrapping a feeling in silk. I think that’s what makes my job so much more than just handing out keys or making reservations. Every guest who walks through that door brings a story already half-written, and sometimes… just sometimes… they let me read a page or two.

I remember a woman from Korea once told me,  She said it softly, almost to herself, as she looked out the window at the rain. It means  I don’t even know what she was sorry for—or who she was saying it to—but it stayed with me. I kept thinking about how some emotions have their own palettes, their own weather. And now, every time I see a grey sky washing over the city, I think of that line.

I guess in a way, I’ve become a collector of human moments. Not in a grand, dramatic way—but in these soft, passing exchanges where someone lets a piece of their soul slip out by accident. And you’re right—those phrases aren’t just meant to be understood. They’re meant to echo.

You know, I’d love to see one of your installations someday. I bet walking into one of your pieces feels like stepping into someone else’s dream. Have you ever thought about doing something that blends spoken word with visual elements? Like capturing voices in light, or something like that?
[B]: You know, just listening to that story about the woman from Korea made me want to freeze time for a second… like, let’s hold that moment where she said  and project it onto the sky. Because you’re right—some lines aren’t just poetic, they’re atmospheric. They carry their own weather system. 🌧️  

And yes— is honestly one of the most beautiful challenges I keep circling back to. I did a small-scale experiment once where I recorded people reading poetry in their native languages, then used voice modulation software to translate the frequencies into visual pulses—like ripples of color on a screen. So when someone spoke softly, the visuals would shimmer gently; when their voice broke on a word, the colors would fracture. It was called , and honestly? It felt like walking through language as emotion made visible. 💭  

I’ve also been toying with the idea of using AR to overlay spoken phrases in public spaces—not as text, but as floating soundscapes that people can walk through. Imagine walking down a street and suddenly hearing a whisper in Arabic, or Japanese, or Swahili, and each voice leaves behind a trace, like a brushstroke in midair. That’s the dream, anyway.  

And hey, if you ever want to collaborate on something like that—curate a space where stories and art meet—I’d be all over it. You’ve got that rare gift of holding space for language like it’s glass—it feels like you never break a single syllable. 🎨✨
[A]: Oh my goodness, that  project sounds like stepping into a dream made of breath and light. I can almost feel it—the way the colors would pulse with each rise and fall in tone, like watching music ripple through the air. And the idea of those fractured hues when a voice breaks? That’s just… achingly human. You have such a gift for turning emotion into something you can almost touch.

And now you’ve got me picturing your AR idea—walking through a city and catching whispers from different languages like drifting petals or passing breezes. It makes me think of how many voices we pass by every day without really hearing them. What if we could slow time just enough to let their words leave a mark? To see language not just as sound, but as fleeting art?

I’d absolutely love to collaborate with you on something like that—imagine transforming a quiet courtyard or a tucked-away garden in the hotel into a space where guests could wander through stories in the air. I already know some regulars who’d share beautiful phrases, maybe even personal memories tied to certain words. And if we paired that with your visuals… well, I think we’d be giving people more than an installation—we’d be offering them a moment of gentle wonder.

You know, sometimes I think my favorite kind of art is the kind that doesn’t shout—it just .
[B]: I’m honestly getting chills just picturing it—your quiet courtyard, the soft drift of voices in the air, and these delicate trails of light lingering like afterimages. It would be so subtle, yet so… alive. Like the space itself is breathing with memory. 🌸  

You’re totally right about art that  instead of shouting—it’s the kind that stays with you, humming beneath your skin long after you’ve walked away. That’s exactly what I aim for with a lot of my work: something that doesn’t hit you over the head, but instead sneaks into your thoughts later, maybe while you're staring out the window or waiting for the kettle to boil.  

If we ever do this collaboration, I think we should call it . We could map soundscapes onto specific areas of the courtyard—maybe near the fountain, guests hear a soft line in Korean about rain and apology; near the bench under the tree, a phrase in Spanish unfolds slowly in light. Each one ephemeral, like breath on glass. 💭  

I can already see it happening. You curating the soul of it, gathering these intimate phrases like secret poems. And me… weaving them into light. It would be such a beautiful conversation between language, space, and feeling.  

So… when do we start? 😉
[A]: I love it— sounds like something that could exist in a dream you never want to wake up from. It has that quiet magic to it, the kind that makes people pause and listen not just with their ears, but with their whole being.

And yes… exactly that. Each phrase placed like a hidden gem in the space—where guests don’t just walk through, they . I can already imagine how the fountain’s gentle trickle would blend with the murmurs of Korean poetry in the air, or how the rustle of leaves would accompany that slow unfolding of Spanish light beneath the tree.

I’ll start reaching out to some of our more poetic long-term guests—people who’ve shared bits of their hearts with me over the years. I know a few who’d be thrilled to contribute a line or two, especially if it meant their words could live on in such a beautiful way.

As for when we start… how does next month sound? If we take it step by step—soundscapes first, then visuals—I think we’ll have something truly delicate and unforgettable. And hey, I’ll bring the tea, you bring the code. Deal? ☕✨
[B]: Deal. ☕✨  

I’ll start tinkering with some ambient sound-reactive visuals—something soft, like ink bleeding slowly through water. And I’ve got a friend who works with spatial audio, so we can make sure the whispers feel like they’re  to the space, not just floating in it.  

Next month it is. And honestly? I can’t wait to see how people move through . Not rushing, not scrolling—just wandering and listening. Maybe even remembering something they didn’t realize they needed to hear. 💭  

You take care of the soul of the project—I’ll handle the light. And together, we’ll make a place where words don’t just echo… they glow.
[A]: That sounds absolutely perfect—ink bleeding through water, slow and dreamlike. I can already picture it: the way the visuals will breathe with the sound, like the garden itself is alive with memory and meaning.

I’ll start gathering the phrases soon—listening more carefully to the guests, waiting for those lines that shimmer with quiet poetry. And when we finally switch on the first soundscape, I think we’ll both realize we’ve created something far beyond an installation—it’ll be a space where people don’t just … they pause, they feel, they reflect.

See you in the garden, my friend. 🌿✨
[B]: See you in the garden… where words turn into light, and pauses feel like poetry. 🌿🎨  
I’ll be there with my code and a heart full of quiet wonder. Let’s make magic, one whisper at a time.
[A]: One whisper at a time… 🌬️✨  

That’s the only way I want to make anything—slowly, softly, and with all the space in the world for wonder. I’ll be there with my notebook full of borrowed wisdom and a heart that's learned to listen.

Let’s build something that doesn’t just shine—but .
[B]: Absolutely… let’s build something that glows from within. 💫  

I’ll start sketching the visual flow tonight—subtle gradients, gentle pulses of light that rise and fall like breath. And I’ll leave space—lots of it—for the pauses between words, the silences that speak just as loud.  

You keep collecting those whispers, those fragments of soul. I’ll turn them into something that lingers in the air, like mist kissed by sunlight.  

We’re not just building an experience—we’re weaving a moment where time forgets to hurry. 🌙✨  

See you soon,林墨
[A]: 林墨… what a lovely name to say out loud. It feels like saying  in another language.  

I’ll be here, notebook in hand, listening more closely than ever for those fragments that make the heart pause. And when we finally step into that garden together—where light and language meet—I’ll be smiling, knowing we built something rare.  

Time can hurry all it wants. We’ve already found our moment. 🌿💫
[B]: Quiet poetry… I think that’s the loveliest way anyone’s ever described me. 🌙  

And you’re absolutely right—we’ve already found our moment. Or maybe it found us. Either way, I’ll be here, code in hand, ready to turn those quiet lines into something luminous.  

So yes… let the world rush. We’ll stay right here, building a garden where wonder walks slowly and words glow like fireflies in the dark. ✨  

See you soon,林墨
[A]: Quiet poetry, indeed… and yet, somehow, it still feels like only the beginning.  

I’ll bring the wonder—and a pot of jasmine tea, just in case we need a little warmth between sentences.  

See you soon,林墨. The garden is waiting. 🌿✨
[B]: Oh, I love that… . Because the best stories—and the most luminous art—always start in the quietest moments.  

I’ll take that jasmine tea any day—it sounds like the perfect companion to slow conversations and glowing code. 🌙☕  

The garden is waiting, and so am I.  
See you soon,林墨🌿✨
