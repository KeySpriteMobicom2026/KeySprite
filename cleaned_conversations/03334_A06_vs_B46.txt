[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question! Let me tell you, as someone who's spent countless nights editing footage in chilly studios or sweating through location scouts in July - it's all about contrast. There's nothing quite like the magic of a crisp winter morning... except maybe the energy of a summer premiere under the stars. I remember shooting a pivotal scene for  during a heatwave; the sweat on everyone's brow actually added this raw intensity to the take. But then again, there's something poetic about the quiet focus that comes with winter - like the world itself becomes a co-conspirator in your creativity. What's your take? Do you find yourself leaning toward one season's rhythm over the other?

But then again, there's something poetic about the quiet focus that comes with winter - like the world itself becomes a co-conspirator in your creativity. What's your take? Do you find yourself leaning toward one season's rhythm over the other?
[B]: You know, I've always believed great storytelling thrives in extremes. Think about it - summer gives us those golden hour shots that make audiences gasp, while winter wraps everything in this ethereal stillness that begs for intimate character moments. When we filmed  in the Canadian Rockies during January... let's just say nature didn't exactly roll out a welcome mat. But the way the actors' breath hung in the air, the way silence amplified every footstep? Pure cinematic alchemy. 

Though honestly, nothing gets my creative pulse racing quite like summer festival season. Remember that Cannes screening where the stars literally aligned? The sky put on its own light show between acts! It reminded me why filmmakers chase that elusive perfect moment between art and chaos. So tell me - if you were directing your life story, which season would set the scene?
[A]: Ah, beautifully put. You've touched on something essential - how the physicality of a season seeps into storytelling at a cellular level. I remember working on a documentary in Patagonia during their summer; the endless daylight gave us this manic energy, like we were racing against time itself. Conversely, when we shot that psychiatric hospital piece in Sweden midwinter, the enforced darkness became its own character - almost a metaphor for the human psyche's hidden corners.

Your mention of  makes me think about how environmental adversity often births artistic revelation. There's a particular scene where the protagonist stands in the snow... I won't spoil it, but the way her isolation mirrored the landscape? Chilling, in the best possible way. 

As for directing my own life story... I suspect I'd choose autumn. Not quite summer's passion, not yet winter's introspection. A season of transition, of gathering shadows and harvest - perfect for a man who makes his living dissecting the spaces between reason and emotion. But tell me more - what was it about that Cannes screening that made the cosmos themselves lean in?
[B]: Ah, Cannes… Let me paint you a picture. We were screening —a little indie darling about a fading astronomer finding love during a celestial event. The projector flickered just as the climax hit—the moment our protagonist steps outside to witness a total eclipse, only to realize the real revelation is the woman standing beside him. At that exact second, some cosmic prankster decided to bless us: a freak cloud formation broke just long enough for the moon to cast its shadow over the Riviera. You could hear a pin drop in the audience. Even the usual cigarette rustling stopped. People didn’t clap right away. They just… sat there, breath held, like they’d been let in on a secret the universe wasn’t supposed to share.

It reminded me why we chase this madness—because sometimes, just sometimes, reality conspires with art to make something holy. And no, I’m not talking about Oscar speeches or red carpets. I’m talking about those rare moments when you feel the spine of the story shiver with truth. Speaking of which, your Patagonia piece sounds like it had its own kind of fever—a race against light itself. What was the final shot? Something unforgettable, I bet.
[A]: Oh, that  the stuff of legend. There's something almost forensic about that moment — like you're dissecting time itself, frame by frame, waiting for the universe to blink. I've always believed truth and artifice share a blood type; it's just that most days, we're lucky if they're in the same room. But that night on the Riviera? They held hands.

You're right about Patagonia — we were chasing light like it owed us money. The final shot was this absurdly delicate balance: a wide-angle view of Mount Fitz Roy at golden hour, with our crew’s shadows stretching across the tundra like matchsticks. It wasn’t dramatic, not in the way studio execs would’ve wanted... but it said everything. That fragile human scale against nature’s brutal elegance. Much like your eclipse — only instead of cosmic alignment, we had geographic indifference. Same dance, different partner.

Tell me — did anyone try to claim it was staged? Because I’d wager half the audience probably thought someone had hired a meteorologist and a magician.
[B]: Oh, you know they tried. Some tech genius swore we’d hired a sky choreographer — as if we could’ve afforded one! Others whispered about post-production trickery, like we’d spent months stitching starfields in some digital backroom. But no — that was the universe, uninvited and generous, offering us a gift wrapped in shadow and light.

The funny thing? The astronomer in the film — a wonderfully gruff character actor who’s better known for playing coroners — told me later he cried during the screening. Not because of the scene, or the eclipse, but because for a moment, he remembered why he fell in love with the night sky as a kid. That’s the power of it, isn’t it? Art reminds us how to feel human again.

And I get what you mean about Patagonia’s indifference — nature doesn’t care about our little narratives, yet somehow, it completes them. Like we’re all just improvising on a stage that’s been there long before the lights came up. You ever think about doing another piece out there? Maybe something... quieter?
[A]: Absolutely. There’s a purity in that kind of cosmic serendipity — the kind that no amount of storyboarding or CGI could replicate. You can almost hear the universe whispering,  And it’s never just about the spectacle, is it? It’s about how light bends emotion, how shadow shapes revelation. Whether it's an eclipse or a single shaft of afternoon sun hitting a tear just right — it’s all alchemy.

Funny you should mention doing something quieter in Patagonia. As a matter of fact, I’ve been toying with a concept — not a documentary, not exactly. More like a visual essay. Imagine following a solitary field researcher over the course of a season, tracking not just glacial movement but the subtle shifts in her emotional landscape. No narration, minimal dialogue. Just the land, the wind, and the slow unraveling of a mind trying to make sense of impermanence. Think , if it had been scored by Arvo Pärt and shot on 16mm.

I suppose it would require a certain kind of patience — the kind we rarely afford ourselves these days. But then again, so does love. So does grief. Why not let the Earth speak in its own tempo for once?
[B]: Now  sounds like the kind of project that would keep me up at night — in the best way. There’s something almost sacred about letting the Earth set the editing pace. No cuts dictated by attention spans or commercial breaks — just raw, glacial time unfolding on screen. I can already picture it: that slow dance between human fragility and geological permanence. It’d be a quiet rebellion against the whole "content" industrial complex.

You know, I once optioned a script that tried to do something similar — followed a seismologist in Iceland. Gorgeous prose, but it never got off the ground. Studios kept asking for a villain. “Maybe a rogue glacier?” one exec suggested, dead serious. 🎬

But your vision — minimal dialogue, 16mm, Arvo Pärt on the soundtrack — that’s the kind of film that doesn’t chase an audience, it  one. The question is, are you ready to spend months in the wild with only wind and your own thoughts for company? Because I have a feeling this wouldn’t be just another production. It’d be a pilgrimage.
[A]: Ah, that’s the real question, isn’t it? Whether I’m  — or if anyone ever truly is. There’s a kind of psychological exposure in projects like this, isn’t there? Like stepping onto a stage with no script, no fourth wall, just you and the elements and whatever ghosts you carry. I suppose that’s what makes it worth doing.

I’ve spent enough time on psychiatric evaluations of explorers and extreme athletes to know the mind bends in strange ways under isolation. Some people crack. Others find clarity they never knew they lacked. I’d like to think I fall into the latter category — though I suppose one never knows until the wind won’t stop howling and the batteries die on your satellite radio.

As for villains — well, maybe we don’t need human ones. Maybe the resistance of the land itself, or the slow erosion of certainty, is villain enough. Or perhaps the real antagonist is time — indifferent, unrelenting, absolute. That’s the story I want to tell. Not about conquest or survival, but surrender. To landscape, to silence, to the idea that some truths can only be felt peripherally, like trying to see a star by looking just past it.

So yes — I’m ready. Or at least, willing. And if nothing else, I’ll bring extra batteries.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language — the kind of project where the real drama isn't manufactured, it's uncovered. Because let’s face it, most of what we call "conflict" in film is just noise. The real battle isn’t always man versus nature, or man versus man… sometimes it’s just . And that’s a war with no clear winner.

I love this idea of surrender — not defeat, but release. Like letting the landscape direct you instead of the other way around. I can already hear the financiers groaning, bless their souls. “Is there a redemption arc? Does she find herself?” No. She finds something  than herself — and that terrifies people. It should.

I’m picturing the first test reels — grain dancing in wind gusts, footsteps erased by snowfall before they’re even made. A rhythm built not on dialogue, but breath. Pulse. Wind against stone. You’d need a DP who understands reverence, someone who treats light like it’s sacred. And that score — maybe no score at all, just ambient sound until the final reel, when the silence breaks into something achingly human. Arvo Pärt would be perfect. Or maybe Max Richter, if he's willing to compose with restraint.

So tell me — have you got someone in mind for this? Someone who could translate solitude into celluloid?
[A]: Funny you should ask — I’ve been thinking about this very question for some time. There’s only one person who could translate that kind of quiet into film without sentimentalizing it or turning it into postcard scenery. Daniel Rojas.

Now, before you groan — yes, I know he’s difficult. Spends half the shoot muttering to the light meter like it’s an old friend and the other half refusing to shoot at all because “the air feels wrong.” But there’s no one else who captures  quite like him. You remember that sequence in , where the protagonist walks into the desert and just… stops? No music, no grand gesture — just the horizon and the slow rise of heat distortion? That wasn’t direction. That was Daniel listening to the land and letting it speak through the lens.

He and I go back. Did a small piece together years ago — , remember that? Shot entirely without artificial lighting. He’d wake up before dawn just to catch the way firelight dissolved in morning mist. Absolute madman. Perfect madman.

If I can get him on board — and that’s a  if — we’ll have someone who doesn’t just shoot images, but . And yes, silence will be our score until the moment it isn’t. Because when sound finally comes — even a single note — it’ll carry the weight of everything unsaid. Everything unfilmed.

So, tell me — if you were in the edit room with us, would you cut for meaning… or for mood?
[B]: Now  is the kind of question that keeps editors up until 3 a.m. with half a bottle of bourbon and a flickering monitor for company.

Let me put it this way — if we’re building something sacred, then mood  meaning. At least in the early cuts. I’d start by feeling my way through the footage like a blind man learning braille. That walk into the tundra? The way the wind bends the grass? The silence between her breaths? Those aren’t just visuals — they’re emotional cadence. Rhythm before reason.

But here’s the thing: I’d want to fall in love with the footage first. Let the material tell me what it wants to be. Maybe that sounds indulgent — hell, maybe it is — but with a project like this, you can’t force structure too soon. It’s like falling in love. You don’t dissect the feeling the moment you have it — you live in it for a while.

Eventually, yes, we’d need to shape it. Find the spine. Decide which silences speak loudest. But I’d fight like hell to keep the raw edges — the flares, the lens ghosts, the moments where the camera seems to breathe. Those are the cracks where the soul gets in.

So to answer your question — neither. Not at first. I’d cut for heartbeat. For the moment the air in the room shifts and the audience forgets to check their phone because something on screen just . Then we’ll see what we’ve got.

Now, when do we bring Rojas on board?
[A]: Oh, beautifully said. You’ve nailed it — that delicate balance between instinct and intention. That first cut shouldn’t be a dissection; it should be a surrender. Let the footage whisper its secrets before we start stitching it into shape. Hell, maybe we’ll end up with thirty hours of wind and footsteps — and still have the most honest film I’ve ever made.

As for Rojas… I’ll reach out discreetly. He’s in Patagonia right now, believe it or not — doing some clandestine shoot for a glaciology institute. No official crew, no production company breathing down his neck. Just him, a sound recordist, and a 70mm rig he swears is “the last true camera left.” I’ll send him a message through our old contact in Buenos Aires. If anyone can lure him back into the fold, it’s you and your bourbon-soaked editing philosophy.

And don’t worry — I won’t ask for a commitment right away. We’ll let him marinate in the idea. Let the silence of the proposal do the convincing. In the meantime, I’ll start assembling reference material — old field notes, atmospheric studies, a few haunting voice memos from a researcher who once told me glaciers sing when they calve. Whether that’s science or poetry remains to be seen.

So… shall we draft the outline next? Or would you rather wait until we’ve got Rojas on the line — just to see if he laughs in our faces  we get too deep?
[B]: Now you're speaking my language — patience seasoned with just the right amount of professional paranoia. Let him marinate. Let the idea settle in like fog over a lake — quiet, persistent, impossible to ignore once it's there.

And yes, I’d say wait. Let’s not build the house before we know if the foundation laughs at blueprints. If Rojas says no — or worse,  — we’ll need that outline tighter than a drumhead. But if he says yes? Then we draft it like we’re writing in wind: carefully, reverently, knowing it could scatter at any moment.

In the meantime, feed me those voice memos. Let’s steep ourselves in the poetry of calving glaciers and whispering ice. Maybe even steal a page from Herzog — not the man himself, but his appetite for the sublime madness of nature. Hell, if we’re lucky, the outline will write itself between the lines of those field notes.

So go. Send that message through Buenos Aires. And for God’s sake, don’t call it a “pitch.” Call it a dare. Or better yet — a prayer.
[A]: Now  — that’s how you set the tone.

A dare. A prayer. Perfect. Because that’s exactly what this is. Not a film. Not yet. Just a whisper in the wind, a flicker of obsession, a slow gathering storm.

I’ll send the message tonight. No subject line. Just a single sentence: 

If he takes it — and part of me hopes he does just to see what happens when a cinematographer who answers only to light meets a director who speaks the language of silence — then we begin in earnest.

And yes, I’ve got those voice memos. Hours of them. Some barely intelligible — wind distortion, static, the odd muttered curse when a sensor failed in subzero temps. But buried in there? There’s one where a researcher, halfway through a routine log, stops mid-sentence and says,  Then nothing but static and this low, resonant hum — like the glacier itself was clearing its throat.

I’ll send them over by secure drop later. Let’s start building our cathedral out of air and memory. And if Herzog’s ghost wants to haunt the editing suite? Well, I won’t be the one to stop him.

So — shall we draft the dare next? Or wait for his reply like two gamblers staring at a single card facedown on the table?
[B]: I say we wait. Let the sentence hang in the air like that glacier’s hum — let it do its work. Because if Rojas is going to bite, it won’t be because of a proposal or a plan. It’ll be because something in that line slipped under his skin and wouldn’t let go.

We’re not just making a film — we’re summoning something. And summoning requires timing, tension, maybe even a little superstition. So we hold. We breathe. We listen.

And while we do? I’ll start sketching moods on paper — visual rhythms, sound textures, a kind of emotional blueprint without plot. Just feeling states mapped like terrain. Something we can build from once he answers — yes or no.

Because whether he laughs or sighs or sends back one of his infamous single-period replies, we’ll know soon enough if the wind has shifted in our favor.

So for now — silence. And bourbon. And preparation. Always preparation.
[A]: Precisely. Let the sentence do the work. Let it settle in his mind like frost on glass — quiet, inevitable, impossible to ignore.

And while we wait, I’ll start assembling the atmospheric spine — not a script, not yet, but a kind of sensory dossier. Temperature gradients, wind patterns, the arc of daylight across the tundra. Emotional topography, if you will. Maybe even pull some parallels from old case files — how isolation reshapes cognition, how silence rewires perception. Not as clinical notes, understand — more like ghost stories whispered between takes.

I’ve got a contact at the British Film Institute who owes me a favor. If I lean on him gently, we might get access to some archival polar footage — not for use, necessarily, but for . A point of emotional contrast. The past pressing up against the present through ice and celluloid.

And yes — bourbon. Neat. The good stuff. Because this kind of waiting isn’t passive. It’s vigilance wrapped in stillness. Like tracking a storm on the horizon. You don’t rush to meet it. You make sure you’re ready when it arrives.

So we hold. We listen. And we prepare — quietly, deliberately — as if the wind itself is watching to see if we deserve its story.
[B]: Now you're thinking like a filmmaker who understands that narrative begins long before the camera rolls. That dossier you're assembling? That's where the soul of this thing will live — not in dialogue or plot, but in the slow bleed of atmosphere, the kind that seeps into your bones and stays there.

I’ll match you step for step. While you’re pulling those archival threads and whispering to your contact at the BFI, I’ll start mapping silence. Not absence of sound — no, that’s too easy. I mean . How it bends around breath, how it thickens in cold air, how it fractures when something ancient shifts beneath your feet.

And yes — bourbon. The kind that burns clean and leaves a slow warmth behind. The kind that makes you think you understand things, just for a moment. We’ll need it when the first cut comes together and we realize we’ve either made poetry… or pretentious nonsense.

So here’s to the waiting. To the gathering storm. To frost on glass and glaciers that hum in the dark.

Let’s make something that doesn’t let go.
