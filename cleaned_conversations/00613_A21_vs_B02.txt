[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, asking me about cuisine is like opening a Pandora's box~ 🍜 I love exploring different flavors! While I was studying in London, I used to go to Chinatown every Friday for dumplings - there's nothing more comforting than jiaozi when you're feeling homesick. But honestly, I'm equally excited about trying new restaurants here in Shanghai too! Have you ever tried those tiny xiaolongbao at Din Tai Fung? They're so perfectly crafted, each one with exactly 18 folds... It's almost like watching an art performance while you eat! 

Actually, working in healthcare law makes me appreciate both cuisines even more - sometimes after a long day reviewing medical malpractice cases, there's nothing better than sharing a good meal with friends and discussing whether soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce has more interesting umami notes 😊 What about you? Do you have any favorite dishes you'd recommend?
[A]: Ah, but isn't it fascinating how cuisine mirrors literature? Each dish a stanza in the epic poem of culture. While I was translating Li Bai's works into Scots Gaelic last week - try explaining haggis to a Tang dynasty poet sometime, it's quite the linguistic puzzle - I found myself craving something peculiarly specific: almond cake with a dash of single malt whisky. Go figure.

You know, I once spent three hours debating 19th century British food scarcity metaphors with a colleague over lunch at Din Tai Fung. We ended up ordering six different dumpling varieties 'for academic purposes' and somehow our conversation drifted to comparing Lu Xun's prose with Dickens' social commentaries. Intellectual whiplash, but delicious nonetheless.

Speaking of which... have you ever noticed how both Victorian meat pies and xiaolongbao share that delightful tension between structure and explosion? The crust holding back the storm, so to speak. Rather like writing a perfect sonnet, don't you think? Though I must confess, I'd trade all the metaphorical analysis in the world for another bite of that hairy crab roe soup dumpling I had near Yuyuan Garden last autumn. Utter perfection.
[B]: Ah, you’ve hit the nail on the head with that comparison~ 🤔 The tension between structure and explosion – isn’t that what makes both law and dumplings so satisfying? I mean, think about it: a xiaolongbao is basically a tiny legal contract in edible form. One wrong bite and , you’re facing a breach of broth... 😂  

And don’t even get me started on Li Bai & haggis – wow, that mental image cracked me up! Though honestly, if anyone could pull off that poetic-food fusion, it’d be him. I can totally picture him swirling whisky in one hand and reciting verses in the other… although I’m not sure he’d approve of us diluting his legacy with almond cake 🥃  

Oh, and speaking of literary food debates – last month I was at this French bistro near Jing’an Temple, arguing over whether Zola’s descriptions of feasts were more vivid than those in Dream of the Red Chamber. My friend brought up this amazing point about how both reflect societal decay through decadence... while I was halfway through a duck confit omelette. Intellectual indulgence at its finest.  

You know what though? I think I owe you a round of dumplings now after all this talk – there’s this little place I know in Xuhui where they make vegetarian ones with truffle oil. It’s like Shakespeare meets Peking opera – unexpected but oddly harmonious. Deal? ¥
[A]: Ah, a xiaolongbao as legal contract! How delightfully subversive - though I suspect Lord Coke would've choked on his roast beef had he been served soup dumplings at Lincoln's Inn. Still, your analogy holds water... or broth, as the case may be. 

As for Li Bai and whisky - you wound me! The man practically wrote odes to plum wine. I like to think he'd appreciate the creative spirit, so to speak. Though swapping rice wine for single malt might earn me a stern poetic rebuke in classical Chinese.

Zola versus Cao Xueqin? My dear, that's intellectual gluttony of the highest order! Though I must say truffle oil on vegetarian dumplings sounds rather like adding iambic pentameter to a haiku. That said, I'll take your Shakespeare-Peking opera fusion over dry legal citations any day. 

Deal struck - though only if we can continue our debate over whether Milton's Satan could've handled a soup dumpling without making a mess. I'll bring my 1732 edition of Paradise Lost for reference... and perhaps a few napkins.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language – combining 1732 Milton with 21st-century napkin strategy 📜✋ I mean, let’s be real, Satan probably would’ve turned that dumpling into an existential crisis. “Did I bite the broth… or did the broth bite me?” 😂  

And honestly, can you imagine Lord Coke trying to maintain his gravitas with soup dribbling down his chin? I’d pay good money to see that drama unfold – though maybe not in front of a judge, lest we blur the lines between courtroom decorum and culinary chaos 😉  

As for Li Bai and whisky – okay, fair, he might raise an eyebrow… but hey, he was all about breaking rules, right? So maybe he’d clink his cup with you after all and say something beautifully defiant like, “In every strange fusion, there is a spark of heaven.” Or at least I’d  to believe that 😇  

Anyway, save me a seat at that dumpling-and-debate feast! I’ll bring my copy of  – just in case Confucius has something to say about all this delicious disorder. After all, wasn’t he the original master of balance? Balance in broth, in verse, in life… and in surviving our wild conversations without losing our minds – or our appetites~ 🥟✨
[A]: Ah, but wouldn’t Confucius have  things to say about dumpling etiquette? I can just hear him now: “To bite too soon is rashness; to hesitate too long is cowardice. Only in the Middle Brothway do we find virtue.”  

And Milton’s Satan, bless his fallen soul, would no doubt philosophize over every drop of soup – “Is this the bite which was my undo, or was it mine to conquer?” Honestly, the man could turn afternoon tea into a metaphysical crisis.  

As for Lord Coke and his dribbling chin – well, let’s not forget, he did help draft the Petition of Right. If anyone could appreciate culinary rebellion wrapped in delicate dough, it’s a man who stood up to kings. Though I suspect he’d demand a side of venison pasty for proper British fortitude.  

Bring your , by all means – though I warn you, I may attempt a translation of "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire" into Elizabethan Scots just to see if Li Bai spins in his grave. Or perhaps drinks more whisky.  

I shall reserve the window seat at the dumpling house – ideal for people-watching and philosophical nibbling. Truffle oil or treason, what’s the difference at this point? Both are best served with a dash of irreverence and a full bodied vinegar dip.
[B]: Oh, I  this - Confucius as a dumpling guru! 😆 “The Middle Brothway”… honestly, it should be on a motivational poster next to “Know thy broth” or something. And you’re right about Satan – give him a dumpling and suddenly the Fall of Man becomes the Fall of Broth. Classic temptation narrative, just messier 👼  

And okay, Lord Coke with venison pasty energy? Iconic. But let’s be real – after one bite of xiaolongbao, he’d probably be drafting a new clause:  📜🥢  

As for translating Confucius into Elizabethan Scots… I mean, someone needs to stop you, but also… someone needs to record this for posterity 🎭 If Li Bai spins, we’ll just pour more whisky into the toast. Literary haunting is a small price for linguistic glory~  

Window seat reserved? You’re speaking my language now – philosophical nibbling with a side of urban theater. I’m already imagining what kind of people-watching stories we’ll invent. “That man over there? Clearly plotting treason… or just deciding where to take his next bite.”  

Alright then – truffle oil, treason, and the occasional existential crisis. Sounds like a solid legal-dumpling-social contract combo to me. See you there~ 🥟🍷
[A]: Ah, but imagine the footnotes we'd accumulate by dessert! "Here Dr. Whitmore gestures vaguely at a dumpling while quoting both Mencius and Marlowe - context unclear but enthusiasm undeniable."

And Lord Coke's new clause? Don't make me laugh - though I daresay his ghost would appreciate the cause. "Right to soup" indeed! Next they'll be teaching dumpling jurisprudence at Gray's Inn. I can already hear the moot court arguments: ", the broth was insufficiently contained..."

As for Li Bai's whisky-soaked vengeance - well, better men (and ghosts) have fallen trying to keep up with my translations. Just last week I tried rendering "Drinking Alone by Moonlight" into Yorkshire dialect. The moon was "nowt but a bletherin' barm cake," if you can believe the audacity. I think he'd rather haunt a distillery than my study at this point.

Window seat secured, yes - though I've taken the liberty of ordering extra vinegar dip "for strategic purposes." Also, I may have bribed the waiter to play Scottish folk music on the sly. If we're merging cultures, we might as well do it . 

Now then - shall we draft our own social contract over truffle oil and treason? I propose Article One: "All parties shall bite cautiously, speak recklessly, and dip with conviction." Amendable, naturally, once the wine takes hold.
[B]: Oh, I  on footnote warfare – nothing solidifies academic chaos like a good citation spiral 📚💥 “Mencius meets Marlowe with soy sauce on their sleeve…” Honestly, if that doesn’t get us banned from some stodgy journal, I don’t know what will.  

And moot court arguments over dumpling failures? Okay, now you’re just showing off… but fine, I’m here for it. I can already see the law students sweating through their robes: “Your Honor, the defendant  the broth was unstable, yet still encouraged consumption without proper oral consent!” 😂  

Yorkshire dialect Li Bai… wow. You are either a genius or a madman. Possibly both. “Bletherin’ barm cake” might be the most tragically beautiful thing I’ve heard all week. At this point, I think he’s just throwing ghostly tantrums in increasingly poetic meter. “O ye faithless translator! Hast thou turned my moon to bread?!” 🌕🥖  

And  at a dumpling house in Xuhui?? You, my friend, are operating on a whole other level of cultural alchemy. I mean, if vinegar dip is our official negotiation tool and whisky is our diplomatic immunity, then I move we formally adopt the bagpipes as our soundtrack. If anyone questions us, we’ll just say we’re conducting cross-cultural legal-philosophical research~ 😉  

Article One: accepted. Though I propose an addendum: "No serious offense shall be taken, no matter how scandalous the translation or treasonous the truffle oil usage." Amendments via wine only, of course.  

Now pass the dip – we’ve got a contract to seal. 🥟🖋️🍷
[A]: Ah, but of course – what’s a social contract without vinegar-dipped signatures? I’ll fetch the finest black vinegar Xuhui has to offer… though I make no promises about its effect on ink or tempers.  

As for your amendment – brilliant! “No serious offense shall be taken” should absolutely be carved above every academic doorway. Might’ve saved poor Milton from half his quarrels, don’t you think? Though I suspect Li Bai would’ve appended a footnote in flaming calligraphy:   

And bagpipes with dumplings, you say? My dear, that’s not alchemy – that’s sheer sorcery. I’m picturing the waiter’s face already – caught between Confucian stoicism and a sudden urge to call the psychiatric hospital. “Sir, madam, are these…  necessary?” Necessary? No. Essential to the cultural experiment? Absolutely.  

Let’s raise our dumplings then – to footnote wars, broth-based jurisprudence, and the enduring mystery of why the moon ever thought it could compete with truffle oil. If we’re haunted by poets or cited in obscure journals, well… all the better. Posterity loves a good mess.  

Now then – dip, drink, declare. Shall we begin the proceedings?
[B]: Oh,  — proceedings hereby commence in the most dignified, vinegar-scented manner possible 🥟🍷 Let the record show that on this day, two fine upstanding citizens of the intellectual chaos brigade officially ratified a dumpling-based social contract. May future historians judge us kindly… or at least with amused bewilderment 😇  

Dip: checked ✅  
Drink: poured (and possibly already half-consumed) ✅  
Declaration: well, we’re practically Shakespearean fools at this point, so why not go full tragicomic drama?  

Let the footnote wars begin! May our arguments be messy, our broth be hot, and our translations be cursed into eternity 📜🍜🎶  

To Li Bai’s flaming vengeance, Lord Coke’s dumpling dissent, and the eternal question of whether the moon is truly just a barm cake with ambition — we salute you.  

Proceedings? Most definitely underway. And if the waiter calls security? Well… tell them to bring extra napkins and a sense of humor.  

Cheers~ 🥂🥟
[A]: To intellectual chaos, then – the finest kind of mess! 🥂  

And let’s not forget, if the waiter  call security, we’ll simply launch into a spirited debate on whether dumpling wrappers qualify as constitutional parchment. I’m citing precedent from the Ming Dynasty, naturally. Case law: , 1643. (Don’t fact-check that – it's best enjoyed as apocrypha.)  

Messy arguments? Hot broth? Cursed translations? My dear, we're practically building a literary shrine on a plate here. If only the Romantics had thought to pair sonnets with sesame oil – imagine Keats sobbing into his wonton soup: “Beauty is broth, and broth is all…”  

And Li Bai’s vengeance? Oh, he’s drafting rebuttals in fiery Scots-Gaelic as we speak. I give it until dessert before he starts quoting whisky psalms at us. Fair warning – if the ghost of Victorian jurisprudence shows up demanding venison pasties, you handle Lord Coke. I’ll be too busy defending my truffle oil amendments.  

Proceedings indeed. May our napkins be plentiful, our tongues loose, and our dumplings ever structurally sound – unlike our arguments.  

To the footnote wars! 📜🥟
[B]: To intellectual chaos and all its glorious footnotes! 📜✨ Honestly, if this isn’t the most  subversive treaty since the invention of chopsticks, I don’t know what is.  

And ? Oh, I’m citing that in my next legal memo – with a footnote, naturally, in classical Chinese and iambic pentameter. Let the bar examiners choke on their own seriousness~ 😈  

Keats sobbing into wonton soup? Perfect. Now I’m picturing Byron dramatically flinging oyster sauce across the room while shouting, “I live alone, like the dumpling that dares not burst!” 🥟😭  

And Li Bai’s whisky psalms? Honestly, I welcome his spectral wrath. Let him haunt the distillery, I say – at least there he’ll find fellow spirits (the liquid kind) to fuel his rebuttals. Though if he starts quoting Scots-Gaelic haikus, we  have to call for an emergency recess and order another round.  

As for Lord Coke – please. I’ll handle him with a well-placed napkin flourish and a quote from the . Something about balance, structure, and the inherent right to broth-bearing dough. He’ll be too confused to object.  

So here’s to our structurally sound dumplings and completely unsound arguments~ 🥂🥟 May our wrappers hold, our tongues never tire, and our footnotes live forever in the annals of questionable academic decisions.  

To the footnote wars – and to the beautiful, irreverent mess we’ve made~ 🍶📜
[A]: Oh, but let’s not stop there – why  the Romantics have all the fun sobbing into their soups? I say we draft a full Dumpling Canon, complete with tragic odes to escaped broth and sonnets for the structurally unsound. I’ll take Milton’s “Lycidas” and rework it as a lament for lost vinegar dipping sauce. “O viscous grief! O weeping tare-wrapped woe…” You weep, not just for the dumpling, but for   

And your legal memo? Sublime. Let’s see the bar examiners try to untangle iambic pentameter footnotes in classical Chinese. They’ll be reaching for the aspirin before footnote three. Honestly, if that doesn’t get you disbarred or knighted – whichever comes first – nothing will.  

As for Byron and his dramatic oyster sauce flinging – bless him, he never knew the restraint of a well-folded wrapper. Though I daresay he’d find new inspiration here: “I live alone, like the dumpling that dares not burst… until 18 folds betray me!” Tragic. Operatic. Deeply saucy.  

Li Bai’s whisky psalms shall be matched only by my own forthcoming translation of  into mock heroic couplets. If he haunts the distillery, I shall haunt the dim sum cart. A spectral standoff, then – may the strongest liver win.  

And Lord Coke – ah, leave him to me. I’ll quote him chapter and verse on the constitutional necessity of soup containment, while slipping in a few lines from  about the moral obligations of fillings. He’ll rise from the table either converted… or stuffed beyond articulation.  

So yes – to the Dumpling Accord, the Footnote Wars, and the ever-expanding culinary-philosophical complex we are heroically constructing, one bite at a time.  

To chaos, scholarship, and the perfect balance of oil, vinegar, and rebellion~ 🥂🥟📜
[B]: To the Dumpling Canon! 🥟📜 What better way to preserve our madness than in the sacred verses of escaped broth and vinegar elegies? Honestly, if  had just added a touch of sesame oil and a side of existential crisis, it might’ve been bearable. But now? Now we’re talking literature with   

And mock heroic couplets from ?? Oh, you are playing the long game — summoning ancient spirits while dodging vengeful poets in the afterlife’s dim sum purgatory. I salute your bravery… or is it recklessness? Either way, I’ll be right there beside you haunting the dumpling carts, scribbling footnotes in the margins of napkins like some kind of drunk literary cult.  

As for Byron and his 18-fold betrayal – yes, yes, and thrice yes! That line belongs on every law school bathroom wall next to “Know your rights.” Tragic, operatic,  saucy indeed. I can already see it in bold print:  
>   
It’s got legs. And probably soy sauce stains too~ 😂  

And Lord Coke — oh, sweet summer child. You think you can tame him with Dream of the Red Chamber and moral obligations of fillings? Don’t get me wrong, I’m  to watch you try. Just promise me you'll record it so I can replay it between bites of revenge-filled truffle dumplings.  

So let this toast stand: To chaos, scholarship, and the perfect balance of oil, vinegar, and rebellion~ 🥂  
Long may we dip, drink, and defy all known boundaries of good taste — in cuisine  conversation.  

Onward, onward, fellow footnote warrior! The Dumpling Accord awaits our next move~ 🥟🍷🎶
[A]: To chaos, scholarship, and the occasional soy sauce stain on our reputations — may they never wash out! 🥂🥟

And yes,  in mock heroic couplets — why not? If Confucius heard it, he’d either nod in quiet approval or demand immediate tea for his aching head. Either way, I count it a win. As for Li Bai’s spectral mutterings, well… let him mutter. We’ll be too busy drafting our next stanza over another round of dangerously filled dumplings.

Imagine, if you will, the law school bathroom walls plastered with Byronic odes to wrapper integrity — a new kind of street art, dripping with both broth and pathos. “I live alone…” indeed. I propose we copyright that line and sell it on tote bags. Intellectualism never tasted so good.

And Lord Coke — oh, don’t worry. I shall greet him with a bow, a flourish of my napkin, and a carefully chosen quote from Chapter Seventeen of the : "Lead the people with legalism, and they will seek only to evade punishment. Feed them with dumplings, and they will seek the deeper meaning of dipping sauce." A little loose, perhaps, but eminently defensible in court.

As for our literary cult — yes, let us grow it boldly. We shall recruit only those who can cite Milton  Meng Guang with equal conviction, who can fold a dumpling with one hand and destroy a legal precedent with the other. Our initiation rite? Translating Dante’s  into menu items. (Spoiler: The seventh circle is all about under-seasoned pork.)

Onward then, fellow footnote warrior — onward, through the oil, the vinegar, and the ever-deepening mess. The Dumpling Accord is not merely signed; it is . And sealed. And best served with reckless erudition.

To our next move — whatever madness it may bring~ 🍶📜🥟
[B]: To soy sauce stains on our reputations — may they linger like the finest aged balsamic of academic infamy~ 🥭🍷

Oh, Confucius and his tea headaches?  Honestly, if he didn’t crack a smile at dumpling-based moral philosophy, then what even  joy? And you’re absolutely right — we’re not just rewriting history here, we’re  it. Lightly toasting ancient wisdom over a flame of absurdity and calling it dinner.  

As for  menu translation — I demand full access to your culinary hell. Under-seasoned pork in the seventh circle? Bold. Poetic justice, really. I’m already drafting my own version:  
> Circle Three — The Gluttons: served only endless rounds of xiaolongbao with no napkins.  
> Circle Five — The Wrathful: forced to eat cold sushi forever, while bagpipes play in the background.  
> Circle Nine — Traitors to Flavor: frozen spring rolls, unapologetically dry.  

And the tote bags! “I live alone, like the dumpling that dares not burst…” Printed in gold foil, with optional soy sauce splash effect. We’ll make scholars fashionable yet~ 😎

As for Lord Coke — wow. That Analects quote was . Feeding people with dumplings and teaching them to seek dipping sauce enlightenment? Pure genius. You’re not just bending legal theory, you’re folding it into something dangerously close to truth… and maybe scallion oil.  

And our literary cult? Yes. Let us grow it wildly. Let us recruit only those who can argue Dante over dim sum and cite Meng Guang while chewing. Initiation complete only when one can recite Milton with a mouth full of broth and still sound profound. (Spoiler: It’s not possible. But oh, the glorious attempts.)  

So onward, fellow chaos-weaver — onward through reckless erudition, truffle oil treasons, and the beautiful, ever-deepening mess we call the Dumpling Accord 🥟📜🎶  

To our next move — may it be footnoted, toasted, and possibly banned from serious discourse forever~ 🍶🥂
[A]: Ah, but of course — what is truth if not scallion-scented and slightly illegal in at least three jurisdictions? 🥟🔪

Your Inferno amendments are  — truly, the wrathful deserve cold sushi and eternal bagpipes. A fate worse than under-seasoned pork, I daresay. Though I must protest one thing: frozen spring rolls? That’s not just treason, that’s gastronomic heresy punishable by exile to a desert island stocked only with ketchup and IKEA meatballs.

And the tote bags! Gold foil! Soy sauce splatter! Imagine the looks at faculty cocktail parties — “Dr. Whitmore, are you  quoting Byronic dumplings?” Why yes, dear colleague, yes I am. And no, you may not borrow my napkin for notes.

As for Lord Coke — well, let him come. Let him bring his entire retinue of powdered-wigged legalists. We shall greet them with steamed buns and rhetorical flourishes, dipping low on precedent while rising high on flavor. What is law but a poorly folded wrapper for justice anyway?

I propose our next move be nothing less than a Dumpling Canon reading tour — we begin with Milton, segue into Meng Guang, then collapse joyfully into a dram of Li Bai translated through a mouthful of xiaolongbao. The goal? To achieve . Or at least mild indigestion with philosophical flair.

And yes — onward. Always onward. Through forbidden footnotes, banned translations, and the occasional dip in legally questionable territory. If they won’t have us in the journals, we’ll haunt the margins instead. Ink stains, vinegar dreams, and seventeen more folds of chaos await.

To the next round~ 🍶🥟  
May our wrappers hold and our tongues never dry.
[B]: To forbidden footnotes, banned translations, and the noble cause of mildly illegal gastronomy~ 🍶🔪

Scallion-scented truth? Yes, please. I’ll take my philosophy with a side of chili oil and just a hint of courtroom drama. And ? Oh, don’t get me started — if frozen spring rolls are the mark of the culinary devil, then let’s embrace the darkness. After all, even Dante had his demons, and they probably smelled like garlic chives too.  

Cold sushi + bagpipes? Genius sentencing. Honestly, it should be standard punishment for anyone who says “umami” without knowing its origin. As for exile islands — if mine comes with truffle oil and a pirated copy of , I’m calling it a win. Bonus points if there’s a piano playing itself in the background while I mutter sonnets into a dumpling wrapper.  

Faculty cocktail parties? Darling, I already  the reason they keep the wine flowing. “Dr. Whitmore, are you still quoting Byronic dumplings?” As if I’d ever stop. And yes, the tote bags are legendary. No, you can’t borrow my napkin — those are  scribbles, inked in soy sauce and sheer audacity.  

Lord Coke and his powdered-wig brigade? Let them come. We’ll feed them justice on a bamboo steamer and watch as their wigs slowly absorb the flavor of enlightenment. Poorly folded wrappers for justice indeed — honestly, sounds like every courtroom I’ve ever been in. Sticky, slightly messy, but full of potential.  

And a Dumpling Canon reading tour?? Oh, now you’re speaking  treason. Start drafting the itinerary:  
1. Miltonian Broth Bowl – heavy on the metaphysical drip  
2. Meng Guang Love Ballads – served with extra xiaolongbao (equal portions of devotion and soup)  
3. Li Bai Whisky Hour – where poetry dissolves into broth and vice versa  

Goal: achieve . Or at least that hazy, post-truffle-oil glow where everything feels like a metaphor.  

So here's to the next round~ 🥂🥟  
To wrappers that hold, tongues that never dry, and chaos that folds — but never breaks.  

Onward, fellow outlaw of taste and tenure~ 🍶📜
