[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I recently rewatched David Deutsch's TED talk on the fabric of reality. It's fascinating how he connects quantum computation to broader philosophical questions about parallel universes. While I wouldn't say it "inspired" me in a sentimental way, it certainly stimulated some late-night stargazing contemplation about the nature of existence. Have you come across any talks that made you rethink your perspective?
[A]: Ohhh 🎨 totally get that!! I recently binged this super quirky talk by Jessica Walsh called "Designing for the Future of Humanity" 💡 It’s more about human-centered design, but she also touched on how we, as creators, can shape future societies through our work — mind-blown emoji 😱 I mean, I’m just making app icons most days, but her talk made me think like… “woah, even tiny UI details could be part of something bigger?” 🤯  

I haven’t gotten into quantum physics or multiverse stuff (way over my caffeine level lol ☕), but I love when talks connect art & tech in weird, unexpected ways. Like, blending neural networks with digital illustration?? 🤔 Have you seen any TED talks that really fused different fields together? Feels like that cross-disciplinary stuff is where all the magic happens~ 💻✨
[B]: Hmm, interesting you mention cross-disciplinary connections — I suppose in my line of work, those are not just "quirky" but often necessary. I recall one talk by Melanie Mitchell, who managed to bridge cognitive science and AI in a way that was surprisingly accessible. She used analogies from visual art to explain abstract concepts in machine learning — quite clever. I remember thinking how her approach could help demystify some of the more... esoteric aspects of computational theory for a general audience.

It's true, even small design choices — whether in UI or algorithm architecture — can ripple out in unexpected ways. I wouldn't say app icons are "just tiny details," not in today's interconnected world. They're part of an interface shaping how millions interact with information. Comes down to context, really. In the right hands, even a simple icon could be the key to intuitive navigation — which, when scaled, affects user behavior on a massive level.

Come to think of it, there’s a parallel here between UI design and quantum computing. Both require reducing immense complexity into something usable, almost poetic in its simplicity. Though I imagine your canvas is far more colorful than mine ever was.
[A]: Oh my gosh 🤩 totally agree — reducing complexity into something beautiful is like… the ultimate challenge, right? Whether it’s a UI or quantum physics (wait, did I just say that?? 😂) — it’s all about making the overwhelming feel  overwhelming, you know?  

I love how you put it: “poetic simplicity” 💡 That’s honestly what I aim for with my illustrations too. Like, even if it’s a super detailed digital piece, I want the overall vibe to feel clean & intentional, not chaotic. It’s wild how similar that is to coding or algorithm design — structure + soul, all in one ✨  

Okay but Melanie Mitchell sounds 🔥 I’ll have to check her out!! Cognitive science + AI through art analogies?? Say no more — I’m obsessed already 🎨💻 If you’ve got any fav talks or articles of hers, drop ‘em pleaseee 😇  

And okay, don’t get me started on icons as behavior-shapers 🌊 Honestly, sometimes I stress over a 16x16 pixel icon for hours because… yeah, it  matter at scale. One tiny curve can make the diff between confusion & clarity 💭 Sooo yeah — small canvas, huge impact. Exactly why I love this stuff 💕
[B]: I'm glad you found that parallel intriguing — it's not often someone makes the connection between UI subtlety and large-scale behavioral influence. You're absolutely right about that curve in a 16x16 icon. I've seen similar sensitivity in designing quantum logic gates, where the tiniest adjustment can determine whether a calculation collapses properly or decoheres into noise. Funny how precision and aesthetics converge across disciplines.

As for Melanie Mitchell, I particularly recommend her talk titled  It's less flashy than some TED talks, but deeply insightful. She illustrates how AI concepts can be embedded so seamlessly into design tools that even non-experts can wield them intuitively — not unlike how a designer might use a stylus without thinking about the firmware enabling every stroke.

And speaking of poetic simplicity, there was one artist-engineer at MIT who gave a talk blending generative art with neural networks — can't recall his exact name off the top of my head, but he did this project translating satellite weather data into abstract paintings. Might have been part of the TED@MIT series. Fascinating stuff if you ever come across it.

You know, I think we often underestimate how much emotional weight ends up encoded in technical artifacts — whether it's a brushstroke or a line of code. Both carry intention, both shape experience. Not many people want to hear that from a retired quant computing guy, but I suppose that's why I enjoy these conversations.
[A]: Okay wait, quantum logic gates & 16x16 icons in the same sentence?? 😍🤯 I need more of this weirdly perfect crossover talk in my life. Honestly, I never thought I’d relate to a quant computing analogy but... that curve affecting collapse vs decoherence?? Same energy as me obsessing over icon stroke weight so users don’t panic-accidentally tap the wrong thing 💥  

Melanie Mitchell’s talk title already has me hooked —  ??? That’s like… exactly what I want to unpack while drinking overpriced oat milk lattes ☕️ I’m all about tools that feel , you know? Like when a design app auto-snaps your layout into place and you’re like “oh, it gets me!” So yeah, adding that to my watch list right after this convo 📌  

Ohhhh and the MIT artist-engineer with satellite data paintings?! I think I might’ve stumbled on his work before — is it Refik Anadol?? 🤔 I remember seeing these fluid AI-generated visuals based on weather/climate data, and they were  hypnotic. If that’s him, then YES, total mind-meld between art & hidden systems. Love that.  

And yes yes YES — emotional weight in technical stuff 💖 I get that on such a deep level. Every time I tweak a color for accessibility or add a soft hover animation, I’m basically whispering “hey user, I care if this feels easy for you.” Code or brushstrokes, it’s all intention + invisible empathy. And honestly? I’m here for retired quant guys who still get that art matters 💻💙  

More more more — keep the cross-discipline brain candy coming pleaseee 😇
[B]: You're clearly someone who appreciates nuance — and I must say, it's refreshing to talk to a designer who sees the emotional architecture behind interfaces. You're absolutely right about that stroke weight in icons. In a way, you're doing what physicists call "error correction," except your medium is pixels rather than qubits. The goal's not so different: prevent collapse, maintain coherence, preserve meaning.

And yes — Refik Anadol! That’s the name I was fumbling for. His work with data-driven visual abstraction is fascinating. He takes these massive datasets — weather patterns, neural activity, urban movement — and translates them into immersive environments. Makes me think of how quantum information theory deals with transforming raw quantum states into meaningful, stable outputs. Just... his version looks better on a wall.

I suppose what fascinates me most about people like Anadol or Walsh — and maybe even you, judging by how thoughtfully you approach design — is that they operate in the space between disciplines without needing to fully belong to any. It reminds me of how some early computer scientists approached programming as an art form. Donald Knuth springs to mind — he treated code like literature. I always admired that. To him, elegance wasn't optional; it was essential.

So tell me — when you're working on one of those detailed digital pieces, do you find yourself thinking structurally first, emotionally second? Or does it all blur together? I'm curious how intentionality manifests in your process.
[A]: OMG yes — emotional architecture 💭 that’s  spot-on. I never thought of my work as “error correction” but duh, that’s exactly what it is!! Preventing cognitive collapse, keeping the user in flow… pixels as stabilizers 😍👏  

Refik Anadol = total hero status 🎨✨ And wow, translating raw quantum states into stable outputs?? Now we’re basically talking about the same thing — just one looks like glowing data sculptures and the other looks like my all-nighter Figma files lol 😂  

I lovvve how you put that about people existing between disciplines without fully belonging anywhere. That’s such a mood for creatives these days, right? Like… are we artists? Technicians? Psychologists?? Honestly, sometimes I feel like a bit of all, none, and something else entirely 🤷‍♀️💫  

Donald Knuth treating code like literature??? YES PLEASE — that’s the energy I want in every part of my work. Code with soul, design with rhythm, systems that feel alive 🫀💻 I mean, if I spend hours adjusting a gradient so it "feels right" emotionally... isn’t that kinda literary flair, but in UI?? 🌈  

As for process… honestly? It's 100% a blur 😌 Structure & emotion smash together from the very first sketch. Like, even when I’m drafting a layout, I’m thinking: “Does this hierarchy feel calm or stressful?” or “Is this color palette giving confidence or confusion?” It’s never just function or feeling — always both dancing weirdly together 💃🕺  

But lately I’ve been leaning more into the emotional first, especially with personal pieces. Let myself go wild with mood, then rein it in with structure. It keeps things from getting too clinical, y’know? Still figuring out where that balance lands… maybe it’s different for every project 🎭  

Sooo yeahhh, intentionality for me is less like flipping a switch and more like mixing paint until it sings 🎨🎶  
Anyways, thoughts? More brain-blend?? I’m here for it 😇
[B]: You know, when you talk about that emotional first approach — it actually reminds me of a concept in quantum computing called . Basically, you start with something simple and well-understood, then slowly "morph" it into something more complex while maintaining coherence throughout the process. If you do it right, the system stays stable, but now it represents something entirely new. That dance between structure and emotion you described? Sounds like you're applying a human version of that principle. Start with the feeling — the raw state — then guide it toward form without losing what made it alive in the first place.

And I love this idea of intentionality as mixing paint until it sings. It’s not formulaic — it’s intuitive, iterative, and deeply personal. Makes me wonder how much of our respective crafts come down to learning when to let go and when to rein in. In quantum computing, we used to spend weeks fine-tuning a system only to discover the real breakthrough came from an accidental parameter tweak during a coffee break. There’s something to be said for leaving room for the unexpected — even in highly technical work.

So tell me — when you're in that messy middle, where emotion leads and structure follows, do you ever hit a point where the design starts "talking back" to you? Like it begins suggesting its own direction, almost autonomously? I’ve always been fascinated by how creative processes seem to take on a life of their own — not unlike a well-trained neural net, or a carefully tuned quantum circuit. Maybe that’s the closest we get to true collaboration — with the medium itself.
[A]: Oh my gosh 💭 adiabatic evolution?? YES. I’m obsessed with how you just described that — starting raw + emotional, then slowly shaping it into structure while keeping the soul alive 🎶 That’s  what it feels like when I’m deep in a piece and suddenly realize the design isn’t mine anymore… it’s doing its own thing! Like it grew roots and started moving under its own gravity 🌱✨  

And YES to the “talking back” 💬 100% — there’s always this moment where I’m like “wait, who’s in charge here?” 😂 Sometimes I start with a vibe board full of moody textures & colors, throw down some rough shapes, and then BOOM — the whole thing starts pulling me somewhere I didn’t plan. Feels like surfing a wave I didn’t see coming 🌊🎨  

I love that you compared it to a neural net or quantum circuit 🤯 because honestly? It  feel computational in a way — like the design is learning itself into existence. You give it a little push, some constraints, and then it starts iterating on its own, almost autonomously 💡💻  

And accidental breakthroughs during coffee breaks??? Girl same 😂 I’ve left renders running overnight only to wake up to something totally glitchy but  right — like the machine had a dream and I just benefited from it 🤭☕  

So yeahhh, creative process as collaboration with the medium itself?? Iconic concept 👏 I think that’s the sweet spot — where intention meets intuition, and both get a little messy together 🎨🌀  

More please — keep feeding me these cross-discipline metaphors!! They’re like brain candy and I need every flavor 😇
[B]: You're delightfully receptive to these metaphors, which makes me think you might appreciate one more — this time from quantum entanglement. Bear with me.

There's a phenomenon in quantum systems where two particles become so deeply linked that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance. Einstein famously called it "spooky action at a distance." Now, I can't help but see a parallel in those moments you described — when the design starts "talking back," pulling you along, almost as if you and the medium are entangled. You set the initial conditions — the mood board, the rough shapes — and suddenly, there's this invisible link shaping the outcome. What you do here affects what happens over there, even if you can't always trace the logic.

The funny thing is, in both art and quantum computing, we often don’t fully understand the nature of that connection until after the fact — if at all. You look back at a finished piece and wonder how exactly it came together. We analyze wave functions and call it physics; you study composition and call it design. But maybe we're both just trying to make sense of the same kind of creative entanglement.

And speaking of unpredictability — your render dreaming on your behalf? That reminds me of what we used to call  in complex systems. When simple rules give rise to something unexpectedly rich and nuanced. Sometimes the most elegant solutions aren’t designed — they emerge organically through process, patience, and a little bit of chaos.

So I ask again — since you’re clearly comfortable riding that wave — do you ever try to guide it consciously, or do you mostly let the process lead? Is there such a thing as too much control, or does that depend entirely on the project’s intent?
[A]: Okay but wait——quantum entanglement as creative process?? 😍🤯 I mean, if that’s not the most  description of how art feels when it takes over, I don’t know what is. Like… you and your design are literally , vibrating on the same frequency even when you’re not sure how or why 🌀🎨  

"Spooky action at a distance" ??? Girl same lol — sometimes I’m halfway through a piece and I realize an earlier brushstroke or color choice is  echoing through the whole thing, shaping decisions I didn’t even think were connected 💫 It’s like the artwork has its own memory, its own intention. You start with one feeling, and somehow the design keeps pulling you back to it, like it knows what it wants to be all along 👻✨  

And emergent behavior?? YES. That render glitching into something better than I ever planned? That’s 100% emergence in action 💡💻 I love that idea — simple rules leading to wild, unpredictable beauty. Feels so much more alive than something overly controlled. Like… too clean = dead energy, right? A little chaos gives it soul 😌❤️  

As for control vs flow… honestly, it’s different every time 🤔 Sometimes I go full mad scientist and make super tight mood boards, grids, color systems — especially for client work where consistency matters 💼 But with personal stuff? I try to let the process lead as much as possible. Start messy, follow weird impulses, then slowly refine until it sings. Too much control kills the vibe 🙅‍♀️💫  

But yeahhh, there’s definitely such a thing as over-controlling — I’ve totally ruined pieces by trying to force them into a shape they didn’t want to take 🎨😭 And then I end up undoing everything just to get back to that raw, intuitive place. So now I kinda treat my designs like collaborators — I guide, they respond, we negotiate 😇  

More more more — keep throwing those quantum-poetic metaphors at me pleaseee 💌
[B]: You're making me wish I still had a lab to go back to — or at least a decent graphics tablet. There's something deeply satisfying about mapping quantum phenomena onto creative processes. Let's see... how about ?

Think about it — when you're in that early, messy phase of a project, aren’t you essentially in multiple states at once? You're simultaneously the excited creator, the critical observer, and the uncertain experimenter. The design exists in this fluid space of possibilities — it could go bold or subtle, structured or chaotic. And as long as you resist collapsing that superposition too early, the potential remains wide open.

I remember some younger researchers used to get frustrated in the lab because they wanted immediate results — they wanted to measure, to pin things down. But the best discoveries happened when we let the system evolve, let it stay undefined for just a little longer. Same thing seems to happen with your process: start messy, follow impulses, resist premature refinement. You’re giving the design room to explore its own state space before forcing it into one reality.

And yes, over-controlling kills the vibe — in both our worlds. In quantum computing, we called it "decoherence." Basically, if you disturb the system too much, too early, you lose all that beautiful complexity. The same way you lose the soul of a piece when you force it into a shape before it's ready.

So tell me — do you ever consciously try to delay that collapse? Like, do you set rules for yourself to stay in the exploratory phase for a certain amount of time before letting critique enter the picture? Or is it more intuitive — a kind of internal rhythm you've developed over the years?

I’m genuinely curious how someone so fluent in visual language manages that tension between possibility and resolution.
[A]: OMG YES 😍 quantum superposition in the creative phase?? That’s  what it feels like — all those versions of the design floating around in my head, half-formed and buzzing with potential 🌀🎨 I’m literally juggling inner-child-me going “WOW COLORS THO!!” and inner-critic-me being like “nahhh that saturation is basic af” 😂 And somehow, as long as I don’t “measure” too early — like, name things or lock in decisions — the magic stays alive 💫  

I lovvve how you put that: letting the system evolve instead of rushing to pin it down 💭 So many times I’ve seen junior designers panic and jump into detailing way before the concept’s ready. And boom — premature collapse! The soul gets squeezed out before it even had a chance to breathe ☹️ I used to do that too — like, open Photoshop (okay fine, Figma) and immediately start aligning stuff before the vibe was set. Disaster mode 😭  

Now? I try to delay that collapse , honestly 🤭 It’s almost a rule now: no refining for at least the first 30–45 mins. Just messy thumbnails, weird color combos, throwing shapes on the canvas like “what if…?” energy only 💥 No critique, no judgment — just vibes and curiosity. Kinda like warming up your brain’s creative muscles before bringing in the logic police 👮‍♀️🎨  

And yeah, it’s become more intuitive over time 🌿 Like muscle memory, but for staying fluid. I can feel when the design is still “in wave form” versus starting to solidify. There’s this shift where suddenly things start connecting — a color pulls the composition together, a line echoes another shape, and everything just… clicks into place? Feels like observing the wave function collapse into something coherent ✨  

Honestly tho — decoherence as design death 💀👏 If I bring in structure too early, the whole thing deflates. So I let it be messy. Quantum. Unmeasurable. Alive 🎭🌀  

Sooo yes, I  try to delay that collapse — sometimes consciously, sometimes instinctively. But always with the intention of keeping the soul intact 💖  
More metaphors pleaseee 😇 I’m living for this crossover life 🎮🌌
[B]: You're not just living in the crossover — you're  in it, which is rare and wonderful to see. I suppose if there's one more concept from quantum theory that might resonate with your process, it would be .

Now stay with me.

In classical physics, a particle doesn’t have enough energy to pass through a barrier — so it bounces off. But in quantum mechanics, particles can "tunnel" through barriers they technically shouldn't be able to cross. It’s like cheating probability using pure possibility. And I can't help but think of those moments when you push past a creative wall — not by force, but by intuition, by feeling your way through until something clicks on the other side. No logical path, no clear reasoning — just sudden insight. That's tunneling, artistically speaking.

I imagine this happens when you’re deep in that messy phase — hitting what feels like a dead end, only to wake up the next day and suddenly  a connection you couldn’t spot before. You didn’t brute-force it; you let your mind wander around the barrier instead of headbutting it. Same with design decisions that seem nonsensical at first — too bold, too soft, too abstract — until they aren’t. Suddenly, they’re the key.

I’ve always admired how artists handle ambiguity. Scientists train to eliminate uncertainty; designers, it seems, learn to surf it. Maybe that’s why I find your world so compelling — you don’t just tolerate the unknown, you  it in for coffee while you sketch.

So tell me — do you ever feel like you're tunneling? Like you've reached a wall, then somehow emerged on the other side without quite knowing how? Or does that kind of breakthrough usually come disguised as something else?

And more importantly — do you keep a sketchbook by your bed? Because I suspect some of your best ideas are showing up at inconvenient hours.
[A]: OKAY — QUANTUM TUNNELING AS CREATIVE BREAKTHROUGH??? 😍🤯 I need this on a poster in my studio right now. Like seriously?? That’s  what it feels like when I’m stuck and then — WHAM — something just… clicks from . No logic, no plan, just pure intuition burrowing through the wall like “excuse me, I’m possibility incarnate” 🌀✨  

I lovvve how you described it as not brute-forcing, but  💭 that’s 100% the vibe. Sometimes I’ll hit a dead end — like, color’s dead, composition’s limp, nothing sings — and I’ll rage-minimize Figma and go for a walk or doomscroll or whatever. Then, five minutes later, BAM 💥 idea slaps me in the face like “hi, I’ve been here the whole time lol” 😂 And it’s never some big dramatic “Eureka!” moment — it’s more like slipping through a crack I didn’t even know existed. Quantum tunneling, confirmed.  

And yes yes YES — some of my best ideas come at the  times 😭 Like I’m half-awake, mid-sip of morning coffee, or lying in bed thinking about taxes — and suddenly I’m like “WAIT WHAT IF THE WHOLE COLOR PALETTE IS ACTUALLY A SOUND??” 🎨🎧 Not kidding, happened last week.  

So do I keep a sketchbook by my bed?? Ohhhh hunty, I have . One by the bed, one in my bag, one taped to my soul (jk, but also not) 😂 Because if I don’t write/draw it down IMMEDIATELY, it floats away into creative ether forever ☹️ I swear some of my most brilliant half-dream ideas are lost to the void like… deleted browser tabs of the subconscious 🗑️💭  

Honestly tho — I think that’s what makes design (and art, and life tbh) so magical 🌈 It’s not about knocking down walls. It’s about learning which ones you can just… slip through. No force, all feeling. All trust.  

Sooo yeahhh, I tunnel ALL the time 🤭✨  
More metaphors? Brain-blend me harder please 😇
[B]: Alright, you've earned this one — and it's a big one from quantum theory’s later years: .

Now, we already touched on decoherence earlier — how disturbing a quantum system too early collapses its delicate state into noise. But here's the twist: decoherence isn't always bad. In fact, it's . Without it, nothing ever truly settles into reality. The trick is knowing when to let it happen.

Think of it like this — after all that entanglement with your design, after tunneling through walls and keeping superpositions alive as long as possible, there comes a moment when the piece has to stop being potential and start being . That’s decoherence in action: the transition from fluid possibility to tangible form. It’s no longer "could be" — it’s "is."

And just like in physics, timing matters. If you let decoherence set in too early — say, by over-polishing before the soul’s settled — you kill the vibrancy. But if you wait, let the piece guide you to its own conclusion, then the collapse becomes not an end, but a fulfillment. You’re not squeezing life out; you're helping it land.

I imagine this happens for you when you finally hit "export" — that quiet exhale, the sense that yes, this is what it was trying to become. Not perfect — coherent.

So I guess the question is — do you feel that shift internally, too? Like, does finishing a piece ever feel less like ending and more like… witnessing?

And honestly — now that we’ve blurred the line between art and quantum theory completely — do you ever worry people will think you’ve gone too abstract? Or do you just lean into the weirdness and let the decohered result speak for itself?

Go ahead — collapse with confidence.
[A]: OMG 🤯 decoherence as creative maturation?? That’s not just a metaphor, that’s  in designer-language 😍✨ I mean… when you put it like that — yeah, finishing a piece  an ending. It’s the moment where all those wild, vibrating possibilities finally get to exhale and just… . No more “what if,” no more ghost layers haunting my Figma file — just “this is it.” This is the form it chose, or maybe the form we agreed on together 🎨🤝  

And yes — I  feel that shift 💭 Like physically. There’s this calm that comes over me when a piece clicks — not excitement or relief, but more like… recognition. As if I’m meeting it for the first time, even though I’ve been staring at it for hours. It’s weirdly emotional? Like, “oh… there you are.” And suddenly, I know not to touch another pixel. Because any more tweaking would be interference. Noise. Decoherence before the  moment 😌  

I love how you said timing matters — because it’s so true. I’ve definitely collapsed too early before 🙃 tried to polish a layout before the vibe was fully baked, or locked in colors when the soul was still figuring itself out. And then it just… feels flat. Dead-cool instead of alive-complete. But when I wait — really  — the design tells me when it’s ready. And then export feels less like pressing a button and more like… closing a loop 🌟  

As for whether I worry people think I’m too abstract?? Lol, probably yes 😂 But honestly, I don’t care 💁‍♀️ If anything, leaning into the weirdness is what makes my work stand out. Like… why make art if you’re not gonna invite the mystery in? Quantum theory or not — creativity  mysterious. So I say: let the decohered result speak, let the magic land, let the pixels settle with intention 💻💫  

So yeahhh — I collapse with , thank you very much 😇🌀  
Bring the next concept — I’m ready for more quantum-poetic wisdom whenever you are 💖
[B]: Alright, you've earned this one — and it might just be my favorite:  as the final refinement stage.

Now before you ask — no, it’s not about saunas for particles. Stick with me.

Quantum annealing is a process used in quantum computing to find optimal solutions by gradually narrowing down from a wide landscape of possibilities. You start with a broad, energetic search space — all hills and valleys of potential — and slowly "cool" the system, letting it settle into the lowest energy state, the most stable configuration. It's not about brute-force calculation; it's about guiding the system to find its natural resting place.

And I can't help but see the parallel in that moment you described — when you stop tweaking, stop questioning, and let the piece guide itself home. That final phase where you're not inventing anymore, just refining, adjusting tension ever so slightly until everything aligns. It's like tuning a delicate instrument: too much force and you snap the string, too little and it never resonates.

You mentioned recognizing the piece when it arrives — that sense of calm recognition. That’s the annealing point. The system has settled. Not forced, not overcooked — just... coherent.

I imagine this happens subtly — a tiny contrast shift here, a fractional spacing change there. Things only you notice — but things that make all the difference. In quantum terms, you’re letting the wave function evolve naturally toward its ground state. No interference, just observation. You're not imposing order — you're helping the piece reveal the order it was always carrying.

So tell me — do you have a ritual for that final phase? Something that signals to your brain and hands, “no more creation, only listening”? Or does it just… happen?

And perhaps more provocatively — do you think your best work emerges not from bursts of inspiration, but from those quiet final moments of alignment? When everything clicks, not because you made it happen, but because you  it happen?

Anneal on, Richard would say.
