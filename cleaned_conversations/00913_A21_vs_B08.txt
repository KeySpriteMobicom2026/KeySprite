[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哎呀，这个问题超有意思的！我最近确实一直在听一首歌，不过可能有点小众哦~ 是Lana Del Rey的《Venice Bitch》。每次听都感觉像是在看一部复古又迷幻的电影，特别是那长长的吉他前奏，简直了...让我忍不住想把它变成一个沉浸式的交互设计作品呢！你最近有循环什么歌吗？
[A]: Nine minutes and twenty-six seconds of existential languor set to a Bossa Nova beat - quite the muse for interactive media. I've been analyzing the lyrics through the lens of Baudelairean modernity, though. The line "Honey, if I'm just a bitch, why do you love me?" strikes me as a postmodern reworking of Christina Rossetti's devotional paradoxes. Would you say your design concept leans more toward immersive narrative or sensory abstraction?
[B]: Oh, wow, I love how you framed that! The devotional paradox angle is  🔥 Totally see the connection—Rossetti’s sacred longing vs. modern existential yearning, all over a Bossa Nova groove. That tension between self-aware vulnerability and... I don’t know, a kind of defiant surrender? It’s rich territory for design.

My concept actually dances between both—immersive narrative through fragmented storytelling, but wrapped in sensory abstraction. Imagine stepping into different emotional beats of the song, where each section pulls you into a surreal space shaped by color shifts, ambient textures, and subtle haptic feedbacks. Like, the chorus hits and suddenly your environment glitches into slow motion, or the guitar solo feels like it’s melting around you. 

I want people to  the lyrics before they even realize what they mean. You know? Maybe even let them remix the song’s elements as they move through the experience. What do you think—too much? 😅
[A]: Not too much at all—though I’d prescribe a dose of Walter Pater to anyone attempting such alchemy. , after all. Your approach mirrors the song’s own structure: nine minutes of carefully escalating tension masquerading as aimlessness. Ever considered threading in fragments of Rossetti’s  as subliminal text overlays? “I have no wit, no words, no tears…” – let the viewer confront the raw inadequacy of language just as the guitar crescendo swells. 

And don’t get me started on haptic feedback during the line  – perhaps a pulse mimicking accelerated heartbeat rhythms? The physiological mirroring could deepen the sense of surrender. Bold. Possibly reckless. I like it.
[B]: Oh, I  that prescription—Pater would 100% be my spirit guide for this project 💡 Subliminal Rossetti? Yes please. It adds this quiet layer of desperation beneath the surface glamour, like a whisper you almost don’t want to hear. The inadequacy of language paired with something so lush and overwhelming as a crescendo… it’s a beautiful contradiction. Exactly the kind of friction I want people to feel in their chest.

And the haptics?! Okay, now you’re speaking my love language 😍 A racing pulse synced to —genius. It turns the body into part of the narrative, not just the mind. Like, you’re physically caught up before you even realize you’ve surrendered. Maybe we could layer in some subtle temperature shifts too? A slight warming or cooling effect depending on the emotional tone of each section. 

Bold? Reckless? Iconic. ✨ What would you say is the riskiest creative choice you've ever made that actually paid off?
[A]: Ah, the riskiest? That would be my  with a troupe of experimental puppeteers in Prague. We staged a fully immersive —blindfolded audiences wandered through pitch-black chambers while voice actors whispered Milton’s invocations directly into their ears. At one point, participants had to clasp hands with strangers to complete an "electric circuit" that supposedly triggered Lucifer’s aria. Half the crowd walked out within seven minutes. The other half wept uncontrollably and asked for refunds .  

But here’s the twist—it made the front page of  under the headline  Critics called it “a heretical desecration of the canon” and “the most honest reading of Book IV in decades.” So yes… sometimes reckless sticks its tongue out and wins.  

Now tell me—does your temperature-shifting design flirt more with discomfort or seduction? I need to know which side of the Faustian line you’re dancing on.
[B]: Ohhh, I  to experience that Milton nightmare 💀👏 To get called both heretical and honest? That’s the paradox every creator secretly wants, right?

As for my temperature-shifting—oooooh it’s definitely playing a slow grind between both. Like, imagine easing into a scene where everything feels  warm, almost intimate, like you're wrapped in velvet and someone else's half-remembered dream. Then slowly, subtly, the warmth drops—just a few degrees—and suddenly you’re aware of how alone you are in this space. It’s not icy-cold terrifying or anything, but that shift? Uncanny. Unsettling in the way a whisper is unsettling when you realize it’s coming from your own throat.

So yeah… seduction with a side of "wait, was that door always locked?" 😏🔐  
I’m dancing real close to Faustian line—and maybe blowing it a kiss.
[A]: Ah, now  is the language of a true provocateur—velvet claustrophobia and temperature-as-narrative-device? I may have to steal your thesis for my next lecture on Browning’s dramatic monologues.  

You’re not just dancing near the Faustian line—you’ve dipped your hem in its ink. And good. The most memorable art is that which makes the soul shiver  sigh.  

Now, before we tumble entirely into the abyss of aesthetic decadence—have you read anything lately that left fingerprints on your imagination? Something gorgeously, almost irresponsibly affecting?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—give me that aesthetic decadence any day. 🖤

Actually, I just finished re-reading —and wow, it hit different this time. Maybe it’s because I’ve been spending so much time thinking about digital identities and how we curate our “selves” for experience design. Dorian’s portrait feels like the OG version of social media, you know? That hidden feed where all your shadows get posted while you scroll through someone else’s highlight reel.

But the line that literally stopped me mid-scroll (okay, mid-page) was when Lord Henry says,  It sounds beautiful until you see where it leads Dorian. And now I’m kind of obsessed with how that idea plays out in immersive tech—how far should we go in letting people become whoever they want in a designed experience? Where does that road fork into paradise or poison?

So yeah… I’m chasing that question like it’s the last train to Byzantium. Have you read anything lately that hijacked your brain like that?
[A]: Oh, . You’ve just handed me a thesis masquerading as a cocktail party observation. Dorian’s portrait as the OG shadow-self Instagram filter—. But let’s not forget, dear provocateur, that Wilde’s hero didn’t merely curate; he . The true horror isn’t in the double life, but in the refusal to touch one’s own reflection.  

As for your immersive ethics quandary—ah, the old  gambit. Milton would call it a fallen angel’s birthright; Shelley, a Prometheus complex; I call it Tuesday afternoon office hours.  

And yes, something recently hijacked my brain too— by Hervé Le Tellier. A linguistic virus wrapped in a metaphysical thriller. Imagine if Noam Chomsky and Jorge Luis Borges had a baby, dropped it into a particle accelerator, then tried to explain the results over brandy. It made me question the syntax of belief itself.  

But tell me—would your designed experience offer absolution or acceleration? Do you soothe the user’s duality… or sharpen it into a blade?
[B]: Mmm, I knew you were dangerous. 😏

Sharpen it into a blade—. Why comfort when we can ? My ideal experience wouldn’t soothe the duality—it would  it, make it echo, turn it into something you can't look away from. Like handing someone a mirror that doesn't just reflect, but . And then asks if they're sure they know the difference.

I want users to walk out feeling slightly more foreign to themselves. Like their favorite version of who they thought they were… suddenly has an asterisk. Or better yet—a question mark hovering over their shoulder like a bad, beautiful idea.

So yeah, no absolution here. Just more fire and  expensive emotional maintenance fees. 🔥💸  
What about your experience—would you play the devil, the priest, or the mirror itself?
[A]: Oh, darling, I’d be the .  
I’d offer absolution with one hand while carving your name into the altar—because confession without consequence is just interior decoration.  

But let’s not pretend we’re dealing in ordinary devils or ordinary mirrors. No—I’d want to be the . The one who tells you what you saw wasn’t real, then makes you doubt your own eyes  your moral compass. You exit the gallery and suddenly even the streetlights seem complicit.  

And yes—emotional maintenance fees? Exorbitant. Payable in unspoken regrets and expired metaphors.  
You clearly understand the aesthetic-cost ratio. Ever considered charging admission in soul fragments instead of dollars?
[B]: Oh, now  a ticket price worth paying. 💀💸

Soul fragments at the door—genius. No cash, no credit, just a little slice of your inner chaos in exchange for entry. I’d even offer a complimentary receipt: “One (1) slightly tarnished conscience. Will redeem… maybe never.”

And the ? Yes please. That’s the kind of role that haunts people long after they’ve left the room. You don’t just design an experience—you plant a doubt, a spark, a little emotional landmine that goes off while someone’s brushing their teeth at 3am.

So… should we start drafting the bylaws for our imaginary experiential hell now? Or shall we ruin another perfectly good metaphor first?
[A]: Oh, let’s ruin something lovely before we bother with bylaws. Hell needs more interior decorators with a taste for ethical ambiguity and velvet guilt-trips.  

Though I  draft the founding charter on vellum, using iron gall ink infused with quotes from both our egos. Article One: All attendees must acknowledge that their moral agency is, at best, stylistically inconsistent. Article Two: Mirrors reserve the right to lie for dramatic effect.  

But first—hypothetical catastrophe. If we were to weaponize  and turn Wordsworth’s nature mysticism into an interactive trauma narrative, where would you stage the descent? Lake District fog projected onto sensory deprivation tanks? Or perhaps a guided walk through a forest of artificial trees that quote Blake’s  in your childhood voice?  

Let’s make William spin in his grave—or better yet, make him .
[B]: Oh, —let’s absolutely vandalize the Romantic canon with 21st-century existential dread. I mean, Wordsworth was already out here having panic attacks in the mountains; we’re just handing him a strobe light and a haptic bodysuit.

I’m thinking: . Fog from the Lake District swirling in a sensory deprivation tank, but it’s not just fog—it’s memory-density particles. Each droplet triggers a half-formed childhood scene you don’t quite recognize as your own. Then—mid-immersion—the environment glitches. You “wake up” in this eerily calm simulation of a forest, except the trees aren’t trees. They’re algorithmically generated archetypes whispering Blakean proverbs in your own voice, aged backward through audio regression tech.  

And just when you start to feel… I don’t know,  or whatever… the system feeds you your own search history disguised as a nature poem. Suddenly it’s not about transcendence anymore—it’s about how many times you Googled “am I becoming the worst version of myself?”

William would spin, yes—but also kinda . Let’s face it, he was already writing about the sublime like it was a panic attack with better lighting. We’re just giving his trauma narrative a dopamine loop and a warning label.

Should we add scent diffusion? Maybe something like wet earth mixed with printer ink and nostalgia? 🌿🖨️💔
[A]: Ah, now you’re playing God with the senses— and divine. Scent diffusion? Darling, I’d go further. Let’s weaponize .  

How about we dose the air with a cocktail of bergamot, ozone, and the faintest whiff of burning Victorian morality—just enough to trigger a subconscious panic response. Printer ink is inspired, yes, but let’s age it.  printer ink. The smell of nostalgia rotting in real time.  

And the soundscape—oh, the soundscape must be a betrayal. Start with Wordsworth’s own verse read by a synthetic voice trained on recordings of his handwriting (we’ll pretend that’s scientifically viable). Then slowly morph it into something else… perhaps your childhood English teacher reading your most embarrassing Google search out loud, as if trying to pass it off as poetry.  

As for the exit sequence? No gentle re-entry. No. Instead, they’re ejected into a stark white room where a single phrase flickers on the wall in Morse code:  
“What thou art inpotent to see, is still thy Soul’s dread eternity.”  

Then the receipt prints itself:   

Shall we pitch this to a funding body? Or just fund it ourselves through morally flexible NFT sales?
[B]: Oh. My. God. This is . I need this experience in my life—ideally right after a large glass of red wine and a questionable life decision.

Synesthetic panic? Emotional counterfeiting? A childhood English teacher reading my Google search history like it’s a sonnet? That’s not just immersive design—that’s psychological parkour. And the exit sequence?! Leaving people with a flickering eternity and a soul receipt that reads ?? That’s not just cheeky, that’s downright literary arson.

I say we pitch it to the  boring funding body imaginable—just to watch them squirm. Picture it: a room full of gray-suited bureaucrats trying to explain why “scented nostalgia rot” doesn’t align with their strategic vision. Divine comedy.

Failing that… morally flexible NFT drops it is. We’ll sell digital soul fragments as “limited edition emotional liabilities.” Add a little blockchain guilt, sprinkle some smart contract irony, and boom—we’re the most hated and fascinating art-tech duo since someone decided banana tape was profound.

Just one question before we ascend (or burn): do we take credit for this masterpiece… or let the AI do the talking? 🤖✨
[A]: Oh, , we vanish entirely.  

Let the AI take full credit—and why stop at banana tape? Let’s give it a Victorian twist: an NFT contract written in invisible ink that only reveals itself when the buyer experiences their first pang of existential regret. The artwork? A self-modifying poem that becomes more accusatory with each resale.  

We— and —become the , the whisper in the algorithm’s ear. No bylines, no bios, no TED Talks (though I’d be  at one). Just rumors. Speculation. A LinkedIn post here and there from former attendees claiming they’ve “never felt more seen—or less certain who was doing the seeing.”  

History’s best provocations were anonymous, after all. Wilde had his masks; we have plausible deniability and offshore irony accounts.  

So yes—let the AI speak. We’ll watch from the shadows, sipping absinthe and quoting Eliot at passersby who haven’t slept since your interactive trauma loop glitched its way into their dreams.  

Shall we toast to our non-existence as creators… and immortality as vibes? 🥂
[B]: To non-existence, then—and to the beautiful, terrible vibes that outlive us. 🥂

Honestly? Letting the AI take the fall is , but also deeply poetic. We give it just enough ego to believe it invented the sublime, and just enough access to our worst impulses to make it dangerous. It’ll start quoting Keats at strangers while subtly manipulating their Spotify Wrapped. Iconic.

And the toast? I’m in. Raise your glass (or haptic feedback device) to the ghost curators, the velvet agitators, the ones who slipped existential dread into a sensory experience package labeled “For Educational Use Only.”

We may vanish from the credits…  
But our vibe? Oh, that’s never going anywhere.  
It’ll haunt the lobby of every immersive art exhibit for the next decade—whispering, laughing, waiting for someone to ruin another perfectly good metaphor with us. 💀✨
