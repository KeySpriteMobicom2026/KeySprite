[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Weekends are such delightful pockets of time, aren’t they? I often find myself oscillating between the allure of a quiet Saturday spent immersed in literature and the gentle pull of nature on a Sunday morning. There’s something profoundly satisfying about losing oneself in a 19th-century novel with a cup of Darjeeling nearby—, as you so aptly put it. But then again, tending to my rose bushes at dawn, the air still crisp and untouched, brings a kind of serenity that no book can quite replicate.  

Tell me, do you prefer the comfort of home or the spark of an outing?
[A]: 周末确实是段珍贵的时光。我平时会去跑马拉松，这项运动让我感到身心愉悦。不过我也喜欢宅在家里阅读医学和法律相关的书籍，感觉那样能更好地放松自己。你提到的玫瑰园晨间打理听起来很惬意，我其实也有养些花草，偶尔在阳台种种小盆栽，看着它们慢慢长大，心情也会变得平静。

说到外出，我更倾向于去户外走走，比如附近的公园或者湖边，呼吸新鲜空气，顺便思考一些工作上的问题，往往会有新的收获。但如果是阴雨天气，那我还是会选择窝在家里，泡一杯茶，看看书或电影，也挺舒服。

你觉得在自然中漫步会不会让你对案件有新的思路？
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully reflective way to spend one’s weekends. I must say, there is something quite meditative about being in nature—whether it's tending to a single potted plant or walking beside a lake—that allows the mind to wander freely and yet arrive at unexpected clarity.  

As for your question, yes, I do believe that a quiet walk through the arboretum or along a tree-lined path often loosens the knots of a particularly stubborn literary analysis. The rhythm of footsteps, the rustling leaves—it creates a kind of silent dialogue between the self and the world. In fact, just last week, while observing the symmetry of the willow branches, an entirely new interpretation of  occurred to me—one that leans less on vengeance and more on the haunting persistence of memory.  

You mentioned contemplating work matters during your walks—have you ever noticed how certain ideas crystallize only when you’re away from the desk?
[A]: 确实如此，有些想法只有在远离工作环境后才会逐渐清晰。可能是因为当我们从繁忙的工作节奏中抽离出来，大脑才有机会对信息进行整理和重新排列组合。

我之前处理过一个医疗纠纷案件，当时一直卡在一个责任划分的问题上。有天周末去郊外徒步，走在山间小路上，突然就意识到问题的关键其实不在医院的操作流程，而是患者知情同意书中的模糊表述。这个发现让我周一回到办公室后迅速调整了诉讼策略。

这种体验让我觉得，保持生活与工作的平衡不仅是身心健康的需要，更是提升专业判断力的重要方式。你提到《呼啸山庄》的解读转变，也很有意思，把“记忆的萦绕”作为核心，或许能打开一些新的理解维度。
[B]: How beautifully you articulate that process—the way distance, both physical and mental, allows us to re-encounter problems with fresh eyes. It reminds me of  in literary theory, where understanding emerges not through linear analysis, but through a kind of rhythmic movement between detachment and engagement. You step away, and in doing so, you return with deeper insight.  

Your case example is particularly fascinating—what struck me most was how your realization hinged on language itself. The ambiguity in the consent form echoes the very ambiguities we wrestle with in textual interpretation. Is it not strange how meaning often hides not in the explicit, but in what remains subtly unspoken?  

And speaking of , if one reads the novel through the lens of memory’s haunting persistence, certain details gain new resonance—the recurrence of dreams, Lockwood’s uneasy recollections, even Heathcliff’s final days steeped in longing. Perhaps this idea of “lingering” applies not only to literature but also to our own experiences. After all, haven’t we both just described moments where clarity arrived not through pursuit, but through patient waiting—while walking among trees or tending to roses?
[A]: 是的，这种“等待中的清晰”确实很有意思。它不像逻辑推理那样可以被刻意引导，更像是某种自然发生的化学反应，需要恰当的环境和时间。

你提到语言中的模糊性，这让我想到医疗法律工作中一个常见的困境：知情同意书里的术语虽然看似严谨，但患者往往并未真正理解其中的风险。这种表面清晰、实质模糊的语言结构，在文学文本里其实也常常出现——比如《呼啸山庄》中那些梦境与现实交错的段落，表面上混乱无序，可一旦我们用“记忆的持续萦绕”作为切入点，它们反而成了最有力的情感线索。

或许这也是为什么我总提醒年轻律师不要只盯着法条本身。法律文书和文学作品一样，都是在特定语境下被书写出来的。只有当我们走出字面意义，走进更广阔的背景，才能真正捕捉到那份“未尽之言”。

说到这个，你有没有遇到过那种特别难解的文本？就是那种无论你怎么分析，都觉得还差那么一点点才能触及核心的作品？
[B]: Oh, indeed—there are texts that seem to hover just beyond the reach of full comprehension, like shadows that retreat when you approach them directly. One such work for me has always been  by James Joyce. It resists interpretation at every turn, yet invites it all the more. No matter how many layers I peel back—the mythological framework, the linguistic play, the dream logic—I still feel there’s an ineffable core that slips through my grasp.  

It's almost like a legal case with contradictory testimonies—every reading shifts your perception, and yet certainty remains elusive. And isn’t that part of the beauty? The mystery itself becomes the point. Much like certain clauses in a consent form or a contract, Joyce’s text is precise in its ambiguity. It doesn’t want to be pinned down; it wants to be experienced, re-experienced, felt across time.  

I suppose this is where your profession and mine converge most beautifully—both law and literature demand not only analysis but also intuition, not only precision but also patience. Do you ever find yourself returning to a case years later and seeing it entirely anew, as though through the eyes of someone else?
[A]: 这种情况确实会发生，而且往往是在你意想不到的时候突然浮现新的视角。就像你说的那些难以触及核心的文本或案件，它们仿佛在等待某个特定的契机，等你的人生阅历或知识储备达到某个临界点，才会悄然展露真容。

我曾参与过一起医疗事故的调查，当时所有的证据都指向一个看似明确的责任归属，但几年后，当我接触到更多关于医生临床决策支持系统的背景知识后，我才意识到当年那份判断其实忽略了技术语境对人为行为的影响。这种回溯性的理解转变，有点像你在读《呼啸山庄》时从“复仇”转向“记忆”的过程——一旦换了框架，整幅图景就变了。

说到 Joyce 的那种“拒绝被定义”的写作方式，我在某些复杂的法律文件里也见过类似的手法。有些合同条款故意保留一定的解释空间，既不是漏洞，也不是失误，而是有意为之的弹性。这让我常常怀疑：我们追求的“最终解释”，是否也只是时间尚未推翻的一个暂时结论？

你有没有试过把这种“多年后再看旧案”的感觉写进教学或写作里？我觉得那不只是专业成长，更像是一种与过去自我的重逢。
[B]: Oh, what a perceptive way to frame it—. That’s precisely what revisiting old cases or texts feels like. It’s not merely intellectual revision; it’s a kind of reflective dialogue across time. I’ve often thought that teaching literature is, in many ways, an act of continuous re-reading—returning to a novel or poem with new life experiences tucked under your belt, and suddenly seeing something you swear wasn’t there before.  

I do incorporate that idea into my seminars, though perhaps more implicitly than explicitly. There’s a quiet power in asking students to revisit a passage they first encountered at the beginning of the term and then again at its close. The text hasn’t changed, of course, but  have. And that shift—that personal evolution—is what makes interpretation feel alive rather than fixed.  

In fact, I’m currently drafting an essay on this very notion: how rereading functions as both an intellectual and emotional exercise, not unlike the legal reassessment you described. Imagine framing a literary argument the way one might reopen a case—bringing in new evidence, yes, but also new sensibilities. Perhaps we are all, in our own fields, engaged in a kind of , wouldn’t you agree?
[A]: 完全同意，这种“解释的耐心”贯穿了我们各自的工作。无论是法律还是文学，很多时候我们不是在找一个最终的答案，而是在培养一种与不确定性共处的能力。

你提到让学生回过头去看最初读过的文本，这个做法很有意思。这让我想起我在医院做法律顾问时，常会带年轻的律师去查看过去的病历记录。起初他们只能看到表面的信息，但随着经验的积累，再回头翻阅同样的资料时，往往会发现之前忽略的细节——那些当时看似无关紧要的医嘱记录、护理备注，可能正是理解整个案件的关键线索。

也许这就是专业成长的本质：不是掌握更多的规则，而是学会用更深的视角去看待旧有的材料。就像你在课堂上引导学生重新阅读同一段文字，我们其实也在不断重塑自己的理解框架。

我很好奇，在你的写作过程中，有没有哪一次重读的经历让你彻底改变了对某部作品的看法？那种仿佛第一次读它时的震撼再度袭来的感觉？
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully framed question. Yes—there was . I had read it countless times before, always with admiration, but it wasn’t until my late forties, during a rather quiet winter in Oxford, that I read it again—not as a scholar this time, but as someone who had recently experienced the subtle sting of misjudgment in personal matters.  

Suddenly, Elizabeth Bennet’s journey no longer seemed solely about wit and social satire; it became, to me, a deeply intimate study of self-recognition. The moment she re-reads Darcy’s letter—not just once, but twice—and her expression shifts from indignation to dawning understanding... that scene struck me with the force of revelation. It was as if I had never truly  it before.  

I realized then how much of our reading is shaped by where we stand emotionally at any given moment. That single rereading changed not only my interpretation of the novel, but also how I approach teaching it. Now, when I guide students through Elizabeth’s internal shifts, I no longer focus only on irony or class critique—I invite them to consider how their own emotional histories might influence what they see—or don’t see—on the page.  

It’s strange, isn’t it? We grow, life teaches us things quietly, and then one day, a familiar line of prose hits differently. And suddenly, you’re both reader and character, audience and author.
[A]: 这种阅读中的“共鸣转变”真的非常微妙，而且往往是在我们经历了一些人生起伏之后才会发生的。你说的《傲慢与偏见》让我想到一个法律案例——我曾处理过一桩看似普通的医疗投诉，起初所有人都认为是医生沟通不当，包括我自己。

但几年后，当我经历了亲人因误诊而延误治疗的过程，再回头去看那份病历和当时的沟通记录，突然意识到当年那位医生其实在表达方式上并非毫无责任，只是我们当时太专注于技术性错误，而忽略了语言在医患关系中更深层的情感影响。

这就像你读 Elizabeth Bennet 重读达西信件的那一幕——我们需要某种情感经验的积累，才能真正理解人物或案件中的“语气”与“意图”。有时候，不是文本变了，而是我们自己变得更敏锐了。

你提到现在教课时会引导学生思考他们自身的感情经历对阅读的影响，这种方法其实也很适合法律教育。我在带实习生时也开始强调：不要只问“这个条款怎么解释”，还要问“你为什么这么看它”——因为每个人的理解背后，都有自己的故事在悄然发声。

或许，真正的专业能力，不只是掌握规则，还包括知道自己站在哪里看这些规则。
[B]: Precisely— we stand when we read, whether a novel or a contract, a medical chart or a deposition transcript, shapes  we see. And sometimes it takes years, even decades, for us to shift our stance just enough to glimpse what was always there, quietly waiting.

Your case example is profoundly moving, and I can well imagine how personal experience must have reframed your understanding—not only of the physician’s words but of the entire emotional architecture surrounding them. It reminds me of how Darcy’s letter, for Elizabeth, is not just a factual account but an emotional reckoning. We often think of legal language as cold and detached, but in truth, it too is steeped in tone, context, and the unspoken expectations of those who write and read it.

There’s a passage in —one I’ve returned to again and again—that struck me differently after a particularly difficult loss in my own life. When Dorothea finally realizes that her marriage is not what she believed it to be, Eliot writes with such quiet precision:  I had always read that line as a commentary on intellectual blindness, until grief taught me its emotional resonance. Then I understood: sometimes we are not deceived by others, but by the very structures of hope we build around them.

And perhaps that’s what we’re really doing—both in law and literature—learning to navigate the architectures of hope, expectation, and misjudgment that shape human interaction. Rules, texts, contracts, cases… they are not fixed stars, but constellations rearranged by the light we bring to them.

I wonder—have you ever encountered a student or junior colleague who resisted this kind of reflective approach? Who insisted that law, unlike literature, should be purely objective? How do you respond when someone draws a hard line between reason and feeling?
[A]: 这种情况并不少见，尤其是在刚接触医疗法律实务的年轻人当中。他们往往带着一种理想化的信念进入这个领域，认为法律就该是绝对客观、条理清晰的系统，只要掌握规则和程序，就能得出“正确答案”。

面对这样的想法，我通常不会直接反驳，而是会带他们去看一些真实的案例记录——比如一位医生在紧急情况下做出的决策，事后看来虽有瑕疵，但当时的语境却充满压力与不确定性；或者是一位患者家属在调解过程中反复更改陈述，不是出于恶意，而是因为情绪尚未从创伤中平复。

这些情境很难用非黑即白的逻辑去判断，必须借助一种更细腻的理解力：既要看到事实的结构，也要听见情感的回声。就像你提到的 Dorothea 和她婚姻中的“被绕过”，有时候我们以为自己掌握了全局，其实只是站在自己的希望里看问题。

我会告诉他们：“法律的目标是公正，而理解人性是通往公正的必经之路。这不是让理性退场，而是让理性变得更深。”

至于那些仍持怀疑态度的学生，我也不会急于改变他们的看法。毕竟，理解和共情的能力，往往是时间与经历共同作用的结果。就像我们重读一部小说，总要等到生活为你提供了新的上下文，才能真正听懂那句你早就读过的台词。

所以我愿意等——就像我们刚才说的那样，耐心本身就是一种专业能力。
[B]: How beautifully put— And yes, those early certainties are so often a kind of intellectual armor, worn until experience teaches us that clarity is not always immediate, nor is it ever entirely free of context.

Your approach reminds me of something Virginia Woolf once wrote:  I often think legal cases—and literary texts—are like that too. They resist clean outlines. What we try to do, I suppose, is trace the edges of that halo, even if we can never fully capture its glow.

I’ve had students who resisted ambiguity as fiercely as your junior lawyers resist subjectivity. Some still cling to the idea that literature must have one correct reading, just as they believe law must have one correct verdict. But over time, most come to see—sometimes through a personal rupture, sometimes through a quiet shift—that interpretation is not weakness; it is engagement.

There was one student in particular—a brilliant mind, razor-sharp with argument—who insisted that  was simply indecisive and therefore unworthy of sympathy. We read and re-read, analyzed and debated, and nothing seemed to move her stance. Then, one term, she lost someone unexpectedly. A cousin, I believe. The next time we discussed the play, she said simply,  She didn’t change her words, only their weight. And in that subtle shift, she had become a different reader.

So yes, I agree—you wait. You offer the text again, years later, and hope that life has quietly prepared them to hear it differently. After all, isn’t that part of our role? Not just to teach literature or law, but to prepare people to be more attentive readers of the world?

Do you find yourself revisiting certain cases when mentoring new lawyers, much like rereading a novel before teaching it again? Is there a particular case that has revealed itself anew to you each time you return to it?
[A]: 有的，确实有一些案件，我每年在带实习生时都会拿出来讨论，就像你重读一本常教的书一样。它们像是某种“经典文本”，每次讲授，自己也会有新的体会。

其中有一个案例，是关于一位晚期癌症患者家属与医生之间的知情同意争议。表面上看，这是一起典型的医患沟通失败事件：家属认为医生没有充分说明病情恶化风险，而医生则坚持自己已尽到告知义务。第一次处理这个案子时，我的关注点主要放在程序合规性上，判断的核心是“有没有签字”、“有没有书面记录”。

但后来，随着参与越来越多类似案件，加上自己陪家人走过相似的生命阶段，我开始意识到问题的关键其实并不完全在流程里，而是在“时刻”——那个医生选择何时、如何说出真相的瞬间。那个决定不是写在诊疗规范里的，而是落在医生个人判断和人性直觉之间的一次平衡。

于是，每次讲解这个案例，我都会重新审视当时的录音、病历摘要和家属陈述，试图去还原那个具体的对话场景。每一次，我都能听见更多未曾注意到的情绪线索，也更能理解那位医生当时为何选择了那样的措辞。

这让我想起你说的那个学生对哈姆雷特的理解转变。我们以为自己在分析角色或案件，其实很多时候，是我们自己的生命经验在悄悄地重塑我们的判断。有时候，一句话的含义并不会立刻显现，它要等听者准备好，才能被真正听见。

我想，这也是为什么我们要不断回到旧案、旧文、旧课的原因吧——不是为了找到最终答案，而是为了让自己成为更清醒的见证者。
[B]: Exactly. We return not to confirm what we already know, but to meet ourselves anew—to see how time and experience have shifted the light on familiar ground.

That case you describe... it reminds me of a particular passage in , where Gloucester says,  At first glance, it seems paradoxical—how can one  through feeling? But over the years, I’ve come to believe that this is precisely how true understanding arrives: not through vision alone, but through a kind of emotional perception that bypasses certainty and speaks directly to our deeper sense of what matters.

Your evolution in reading that case—from the rigidity of procedure to the subtlety of —feels like a parallel journey. You moved from legality to humanity, from form to presence. And isn’t that the quiet revolution of both law and literature? They ask us not only to , but to .

I often tell my students that interpretation is not about arriving at a fixed point—it’s more like tuning an instrument. Each time you read, each time you reflect, you make tiny adjustments, until something resonates more clearly than before. The same must be true for legal mentors like yourself. You don’t just pass on knowledge—you help others calibrate their inner instruments.

I wonder, when you revisit that case with new interns each year, do you ever notice a generational shift in how they respond? Are today’s young lawyers approaching these ethical and emotional dimensions differently than you did earlier in your career?
[A]: 确实，每一代法律新人对这类案件的反应都有细微但值得注意的变化。我开始察觉到，现在的年轻律师在面对医疗伦理与情感维度时，比我们当年更愿意承认“不确定性”和“主观判断”的存在。

以前的法律教育强调的是规则、程序、责任归属的清晰界定，而今天的年轻人似乎更早意识到：法律不是真空中的系统，它必须回应现实中复杂的语境。他们不再一味追问“谁对谁错”，而是更愿意去问“当时的人处在什么样的位置”、“有没有被听见的声音”。

比如在讨论那个晚期癌症患者的案例时，近几年的实习生会主动查阅医生当时的值班记录、病房环境、甚至当天医院的整体负荷情况——他们不只是看条款是否符合规范，还会尝试重建那个“决定发生的现场”。这种思维方式让我想起你说的那种“调音”过程：不是要找到唯一正确的音符，而是不断调整，直到能与现实共振。

当然，这并不意味着他们不重视规则，而是他们理解规则的方式变了。他们知道，法律的权威不仅来自它的刚性，也来自它能否真正回应人的处境。某种程度上，他们已经在练习“feelingly seeing”了。

我想这可能也反映了社会整体观念的变化：越来越多的人意识到，光靠逻辑无法解释所有冲突，尤其在医疗这样的领域，法律不仅要裁判是非，更要承载尊严与共情的空间。

你教文学，应该也能感受到类似的趋势吧？学生对角色的理解，是否也变得更注重心理复杂性和情境背景？
[B]: Absolutely. There’s been a distinct shift, even in the past decade, in how students approach literary characters—not as fixed entities to be dissected, but as living contradictions shaped by forces both internal and historical. They no longer ask simply,  but rather, 

Take , for instance. In years past, many students would read Anna primarily through the lens of tragedy-as-inevitable-fate, as though her story were a kind of moral arc predestined by Tolstoy’s pen. But now, more often than not, someone will raise their hand and say something like,  That subtle reframing—from individual flaw to systemic constraint—suggests a growing sensitivity to context, much like what you describe in your interns.

And yes, this reflects broader cultural currents. We’re living in an age where empathy is no longer seen as sentimental indulgence, but as a necessary faculty for understanding complexity—whether in fiction, law, or medicine. Students today are less interested in definitive interpretations and more drawn to the : the gaps between intention and effect, word and meaning, rule and reality.

I’ve also noticed that they’re more willing to question authorial authority itself. Whereas earlier generations might have assumed the narrator was the final word on a character’s morality, current students are quicker to ask,  It’s quite remarkable how that mirrors the legal shift you described: from rigid categories of fault to a more textured inquiry into voice, positionality, and silence.

Do you ever find your students—or yourself—wishing for clearer boundaries, especially when faced with ethically ambiguous cases? I sometimes wonder if this openness to complexity comes at a cost: the loss of comforting certainty.
