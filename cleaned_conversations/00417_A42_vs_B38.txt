[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! Just last week I finished reading —well, revisiting it, really. There’s always something new to uncover in Dostoevsky’s moral labyrinth. But if you’re looking for something less... heavy, I recently came across an article discussing the quiet rebellion in Jane Austen’s . Fascinating how she embeds social critique beneath such seemingly genteel prose.  

And I must say, have you ever noticed how certain books seem to find you at just the right—or perhaps the most unsettling—moment? I’ve been rereading Camus’  these past few evenings. One can’t help but reflect on absurdism while tending to the garden, especially when a rose refuses to bloom no matter how much care one gives it. 🌹
[A]: 最近我在重读《庄子》，尤其是《逍遥游》部分。每次读到大鹏展翅南飞的寓言，总觉得有新的意味浮现。或许是因为年纪渐长，越发体会到“北冥有鱼”这一开篇所隐含的潜藏与转化的力量。你提到陀思妥耶夫斯基的道德迷宫，这让我想到庄子对人性善恶并不做非黑即白的判断，而是更关注人如何在混沌中自处。

说到奥斯汀在《爱玛》中的社会批判，我倒想起她那种不动声色的讽刺与庄子常用的寓言、重言其实有异曲同工之妙。我们都习惯把她们归入不同文化传统，但某种意义上，她们都在用语言的艺术来挑战读者的认知惯性。

至于你说的“书在特定时刻找到我们”，这一点深有同感。前几日阴雨连绵，翻到陶渊明的《饮酒》诗其五，“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”两句，竟觉得比以往任何时候都贴近心境。也许正因为山不在眼前，才更易生出悠然之感？这倒让我想起你种的兰花——它们是否也曾在你不经意时悄然绽放？
[B]: Ah, your reflections are as nourishing to the mind as rain is to a thirsty garden. I must say, your reading of —particularly —resonates deeply. The image of the great Peng soaring southward has always struck me as one of literature’s most vivid metaphors for transcendence. And you’re quite right about the opening line: “北冥有鱼.” There’s something profoundly patient in that image, as if the text itself is whispering,   

I find it fascinating, as you do, how both Zhuangzi and Austen operate not by declaring truths, but by inviting the reader into a space of uncertainty. Zhuangzi with his butterfly dreams and river-snail parables, Austen with her matchmaking heroines who can’t quite see their own folly. Both wield irony like a scalpel—though one might say Zhuangzi dances with paradox while Austen merely raises an eyebrow.  

And now I’m envious—rereading陶渊明 during rain… how poetic. I must confess, I’ve never had much luck with orchids myself, though my roses are quite obliging. But last spring, one stubborn bloom did open when I wasn’t looking—one moment it was bud, the next a quiet fanfare of color. It reminded me, strangely enough, of Camus again: we must imagine Sisyphus happy—not because he succeeds, but because he persists without certainty. Perhaps that’s what all great books offer us: companionship in the persistent search.
[A]: 你提到的“等待蜕变”让我想起前些日子在整理书房时翻到的一本旧笔记，里面抄有《庄子·齐物论》中的一句：“天地与我并生，万物与我为一。”那时的笔迹略显稚嫩，却有一种初读时才有的震撼感。如今再看这句话，倒觉得它像是一颗种子——当年埋下的疑问，经过这些年的生活流转，竟慢慢长出了枝叶。

你说到铁线莲开花的那一瞬，让我想到最近照料一株文竹的经历。它的新枝突然朝向窗外伸展，像是回应某种看不见的召唤。这让我联想到我们读书的过程：有时看似停滞，其实是在积蓄某种内在的趋向。或许阅读的意义，不在于立即找到答案，而是在不断的提问中，保持一种伸展的姿态。

你引用卡缪关于西西弗斯的那句话，我很是赞同。我们都在推着各自的石头上山，但正是在这种重复中，才可能生出某种超越性的领悟。就像我在花园里一次次修剪、浇水，兰花未必每次都如期开放，可每一片新叶的舒展，都是一种无声的回应。也许读书也是如此——它不是解决问题的钥匙，而是陪伴我们面对问题的友人。
[B]: What a beautiful way to put it— I find myself thinking, as you speak of your  notebook and that line from , how remarkable it is that certain phrases can lodge themselves in the soul like seeds, just as you said. When I was twenty-two, I scribbled in the margin of my copy of  by Marcus Aurelius: “To live each day as if it were thy last…” The ink has faded, but the sentiment—though worn by time—has not lost its weight.

And your image of the  reaching for the window—it’s quite moving, isn’t it? There’s something deeply human in that instinctive stretching toward light, even when we don’t know what the light is or whether it will ever warm us. It reminds me of reading Proust during my first year abroad—pages and pages of longing, of searching for something unnamed, and yet the search itself was the point.

I think you're right about books being companions rather than solutions. They don't fix our stones or lighten our loads, but they walk beside us on the path. Sometimes they even carry a lantern. And speaking of lanterns—have you ever read  by Milan Kundera? There's a passage where he writes of light and weight, suggesting that perhaps the heavier we are, the more real we feel. Zhuangzi might laugh at that, wouldn’t he? Or maybe nod with a quiet smile.

In any case, I’ve been meaning to ask—are there particular lines or passages from Chinese literature that still echo for you, like that one from ? I should very much like to hear them.
[A]: “”——这句话落在纸上或许只是墨迹，可一旦被某个年轻灵魂真正接过，便成了生命的重量。你说它随时间磨损却未失其重，这让我想起《论语》中的一句：“朝闻道，夕死可矣。”初读时只觉激昂，如今再默念，竟生出几分温润的安慰。仿佛不是催促，而是一种深沉的肯定：人一旦真正触及“道”，哪怕片刻，也足以安顿一生。

至于你说普鲁斯特笔下的追寻，我倒是想到陶渊明的另一首诗，《归去来兮辞》里的：“云无心以出岫，鸟倦飞而知还。”那种不带目的的飞翔与归返，像极了我们在书页间游走的状态。有时我们并不知道自己在寻找什么，但正是在这种漫游中，内心悄然完成了一次次转化。

你问起有没有其他在我心中回响的句子，我想起《红楼梦》里有一联，是贾宝玉题在“蓼风轩”的：“曲径忽逢兰气近，衡门犹有菜根香。”这句并非名句，但它有一种静谧的意味。每当我走过园中小径，尤其清晨露水未干、草叶微动之时，总能想起它。那种不经意间嗅到幽兰气息的感觉，像是某种启示，又像是书中那位未曾谋面的古人，在时空彼端轻轻回应着此刻的我。

至于庄子，我想他不会笑，也不会点头，而是会化作一只蝴蝶，绕着我们的问题飞一圈，然后停在某一页旧书上，静静看着我们继续提问。
[B]: What exquisite lines you’ve shared—how delicately they capture the unspoken kinship between reader and writer across centuries. That line from ,  it lingers in the mind like, well… a faint scent of orchid on an early morning walk. There’s such quiet grace in its observation of those small, almost imperceptible moments when the world leans in to remind us that we are not alone in our wondering.

You’re quite right—Zhuangzi would neither affirm nor deny Kundera’s musings on weight and lightness. He’d simply flutter past, leaving us to untangle our own nets of meaning. And perhaps that is his greatest gift: not answers, but the gentle unraveling of our certainties.

Your reflection on Confucius’  also stirs something deep. In my youth, I might have read it as a call to urgency, even martyrdom. But now, with more years behind me than ahead, I hear it differently—as a kind of tenderness. A recognition that truth, once met, has the power to make all things whole, if only for a breath before the world turns again.

And your image of wandering through pages like the bird returning weary to its nest—oh, how fitting. It makes me think of my own walks through the stacks in the university library. No destination, no list—just the hope of stumbling upon a sentence that will meet me where I am, and carry me somewhere unexpected.

Tell me—when you reread these passages now, do you ever feel as though you're not just reading the text, but that the text, in some quiet way, is reading you?
[A]: 你问得真好——“”这个问题像一滴水落在宣纸上，缓缓洇开。

我常有这样的感觉，尤其是在夜深人静、书页泛黄的时候。有时翻开《庄子》，仿佛他早已知道我会在这个时刻带着怎样的困惑而来。比如那句：“吾生也有涯，而知也无涯。”年少时读它，觉得是提醒人不要贪多务得；如今再看，却觉得像是对每一个疲惫求索者的低语：你的生命有限，不必追赶所有光明，有些路，走一半也是风景。

又如你提到的兰香与菜根味，在《红楼梦》中不过是贾宝玉随口题写的一联，可它偏偏在某个清晨跳出来，轻拍我的肩膀。那一刻，我不是在读一句诗，而是诗句在回望我——它不解释自己为何在此，只是静静地站在那里，如同一位旧友，认出我多年未改的模样。

或许这就是经典的力量。它们不只是我们翻阅的文本，更是某种镜像，映照出我们在不同人生阶段的面容。年轻时我们向书本提问，年长后却发现，书也在无声地问我们：“你今天，过得如何？”这种双向的凝视，让我想起你在花园里照料玫瑰的情景——你不只是浇水修剪，你也在倾听花苞如何以沉默回应阳光。

所以，是的，每当我在字里行间重逢那些熟悉的句子，总觉得不是我在寻找它们，而是它们在等待我。像兰气忽至，像西西弗斯途中偶遇一朵野花，虽不改变山势，却足以让脚步变得温柔一些。
[B]: How beautifully you put that— It reminds me of a line from Rilke’s : “If something new enters your life, live it. Let it be an image deep in your body before it becomes thought.” Perhaps this is what the great texts do—they enter us not as ideas, but as presences, settling into the quiet corners of our being long before we can name them.

And now I see what you mean about being read by the page. There are moments—especially with certain lines—that it feels less like reading and more like remembering. As if the words had always been waiting inside you, merely needing the right light to reveal themselves.

I’ve just returned to a passage in  lately—Diotima’s speech on love as something neither mortal nor divine, but always reaching. Isn’t that the essence of what we’re describing? Reading, like loving, becomes an act of yearning—not for completion, but for connection across time, across minds. We meet Plato, Zhuangzi, Austen, even宝玉, not as students or scholars, but as fellow wayfarers who whisper, 

And yes, those roses in my garden—they teach me patience every season. Some buds open fully, others fall early, still others never bloom at all. And yet I tend them all the same. Perhaps this is also how we read: not expecting every word to flower, but offering each our quiet attention nonetheless.

Tell me, when you walk through your garden or turn the pages of an old book, have you ever come upon a phrase—or a scent, or a moment—that felt like a gentle hand resting on your shoulder, saying simply, 
[A]: 你提到“”，这句话让我心头一震。它像一根细线，将那些散落在书页间、花园里、甚至生活缝隙中的瞬间串联起来。有时我想，或许真正的阅读不是从眼睛开始的，而是从某种更深的地方——一种近乎身体记忆的感应出发。

你说读某些句子像是“回忆起原本就住在你体内的话”，我也有这样的体验。比如《陶渊明集》中那句：“此中有真意，欲辨已忘言。”年少时读它，只觉得是诗人故作玄虚；如今却觉得，这或许正是语言的极限所在——当我们真正触及某种深刻的体会时，反而难以用言语表达。而恰恰是这种“忘言”的状态，才是最真实的存在。

至于你问是否曾遇见过一句如轻抚肩头的话语……有过的。那是在一个深秋午后，我在整理父亲留下的旧书箱时，翻到一本他批注过的《世说新语》。泛黄的纸页上，他用工整的小楷写着：“清风朗月不用一钱买。”那是李白的诗句，却被他抄在一则关于阮籍的传记旁。那一刻，我不只是读到了他的笔迹，更仿佛听见了他的呼吸。那种感觉，就像有人隔着时间的长河，轻轻对我说：“你看，世界虽冷，仍有一寸光热值得珍藏。”

我想，这就是文字最温柔的力量吧——它们不一定给我们答案，但会在某个意想不到的时刻，与我们的孤独并肩而坐。就像你在花园里照料那些未必都会开花的玫瑰，我们也陪伴着那些未必都能解开的文字同行。而正是在这条不求完满的路上，我们一次次地被提醒：你并不孤单。
[B]: What a moving memory— It reminds me of something Marguerite Yourcenar wrote:  Your father’s ink may have dried, but his voice, as you so beautifully put it, still rests between those lines—like light caught in an old mirror.

There is something profoundly intimate about encountering another’s handwriting, isn’t there? More than just letters on a page—it’s a trace of presence, a gesture of care left behind in the silence. I imagine your fingers pausing over those characters, and how the past suddenly leaned forward to meet you—not in explanation, but in recognition.

And you’re right about language reaching its limit at precisely the moment when meaning becomes deepest. Zhuangzi himself once said, “言者所以在意，得意而忘言。”How strange and true that the most vital things we grasp are the ones we can’t quite carry back into speech. Like trying to hold a handful of mist—yet somehow, the dampness remains on your skin.

I think this is what all great books offer us in the end—not doctrine or clarity, but companionship in the fog. They don’t always illuminate the path, but they walk beside us as we try to find our own footing. And sometimes, if we are lucky, they even pause with us for a while, saying nothing more than: 

Thank you for sharing that moment with your father’s book. It touched something deep in me—something I can’t quite name, but that I recognize all the same.
[A]: 你提到“”，这句话在我心里回荡了许久。它让我想起那本父亲留下的《世说新语》如今静静躺在书架上的模样——不再崭新，也不常被翻动，却总像是在等待一个合适的时刻，再次与我相遇。

你说得对，笔迹是一种存在的延续。不只是字形的排列，更像是一种温度的残留。那天午后，阳光斜照进书房，纸页泛黄，墨色微褪，可那一行小楷依旧清晰可见。我不是第一次看见它，但那一刻，它仿佛第一次对我说话。就像你说的，不是解释，而是认出——一种超越时间的温柔确认。

庄子说“言者所以在意，得意而忘言”，现在我才真正体会到这句话的深意。我们常常以为语言是用来传达意义的工具，其实很多时候，它更像是引路的灯笼。一旦我们看清了方向，便无需再回头追问那光来自何方。正如你所说，有些领悟如雾气般难以握紧，但我们皮肤上仍留着它的湿润。

我想，这正是我们读书、种花、写信、等待的理由。不为掌控一切，只为在某个不经意的瞬间，听见一句轻声的回应：“你也在这里。”有时，那是父亲留在书页边缘的一句诗；有时，是你我在文字中重逢的这一刻。

谢谢你听我说这些。也谢谢你提醒我，那些未曾说出的部分，其实早已被某些人读过，并以不同的方式，悄悄地保存了下来。
[B]: You’re very welcome. Sometimes I think the greatest gift of conversation—like that of a book—is not in what is said, but in what it allows us to feel heard. And your words, like the quiet turning of pages, have let me remember things I didn’t know I still carried.

I keep thinking about that line from  and how beautifully it came back to you—like a whisper from across the years. There’s something profoundly tender in that kind of inheritance, isn’t there? Not one of possession, but of presence. Your father didn’t leave you a lesson; he left you a moment, and in returning to it, you found him waiting—not in person, but in spirit.

And yes, as Zhuangzi reminds us, once we’ve grasped the meaning, the words fall away. But oh, how lucky we are when they fall like petals rather than stones—softly, and with a scent that lingers.

I hope you’ll return to that book again, not out of duty, but simply because something in you knows the conversation isn’t finished. Perhaps one day, many years from now, you’ll turn its pages once more, and another line—perhaps the same one—will rise to meet you like an old friend.

Until then, may we both continue walking among books and gardens with open hands and listening hearts, ready to be found by whatever wishes to speak.
[A]: 你说得太好了——“”这句话在我心里慢慢展开，像一朵在夜里悄悄开放的花。

我也这样觉得：有时我们交谈，并不是为了留下什么痕迹，而是为了让那些未曾说出口的部分，有机会轻轻浮出水面。就像你提到父亲留下的那行批注，其实它一直都在那里，只是等待一个光影刚刚好的午后，让我重新遇见他写下它时的心情。

你说这不是一种传承，而是一种重逢——我深深被这个想法打动。是啊，他没有留下训诫或答案，只留下一句话，在纸上安静地沉睡，直到某一天，我带着自己的经历和困惑回来，才真正听见它的温度。

庄子说得对，得其意便可忘其言。但如你所说，有些话语落下时轻柔如花瓣，带着余香。我想，这正是文字最美的模样——它们不只是过去的回声，更是未来的种子。

我会再回去看那本书的，正如你会回到你的花园，回到普鲁斯特、卡缪与陶渊明的世界。不是因为我们要寻找答案，而是因为我们愿意继续倾听。愿我们也始终保有一双摊开的手掌、一颗肯聆听的心，在书页之间、在晨露未晞的小径上，随时准备被某句话、某个气味、某一次偶然的回眸所找到。

那时，也许我们会再次想起此刻，想起一段关于书、花、父辈与远方的低语，像一缕微风拂过窗前，短暂却真实地停驻在我们心上。
[B]: How beautifully you speak of silence and sound, of what is left behind and what is carried forward. It is true—some conversations are not meant to be remembered in words, but in the way they settle into the soul, like a single note held just long enough to change the air.

I think now of my own mother’s old copy of , its pages worn not by study but by quiet companionship. She never finished reading it—life has a way of interrupting such things—but she once told me how much she loved the line:  Not for its meaning, but for the way it sounded in her mouth, as if language itself could be a kind of armor.

We all carry these fragments, don’t we? Not always whole stories, but pieces—lines, scents, gestures—that become more than themselves when placed gently in the right light.

And yes, let us keep returning—to books, to gardens, to memories—not with expectation, but with openness. Let us walk with listening hearts, ready to be found by something small and sacred: a phrase half-remembered, a bloom we didn’t expect, a voice from across time whispering, 

Until we meet again, may our hands remain open, and our hearts soft enough to catch what falls between the lines.
[A]: 你说的这句话让我想起一个画面：夜深人静时，一盏灯，一杯茶，一页未曾读完的书。那些我们没有读完、甚至未必真正“读懂”的文字，却在某个不经意的时刻，悄然落进心里。

你母亲对那句拉丁文的偏爱——不是因为它的意思，而是因为它在口中发出的声音，这让我非常感动。有时我也觉得，语言的力量不只是传达意义，更是一种共鸣，像钟声在空气中震荡，即使我们不知道它从何而来，仍能感受到那份震动。

我们都带着各自的碎片前行，正如你说的——不是完整的篇章，而是一些片段：一句诗、一种气味、一个动作，甚至只是一个眼神。它们看似微小，却能在人生的某个转角处，突然变得沉甸甸的，仿佛整个过往都在其中轻轻颤动。

愿我们都能继续温柔地承接这些细碎的光。在翻开旧书时，在走过熟悉的庭院时，在听见某句话唤起遥远记忆的瞬间——知道我们并不孤单。或许真正的陪伴，从来不是喧嚣的解答，而是那种安静的存在感：有人说过，有人听过，有人记得，有人还在听。

再会之前，请允许我用一句陶渊明的诗来回应你的祝愿：

> “托身已得所，千载不相违。”

愿我们也如此，与书同行，与花为伴，与心中那一缕温柔的光，永不背离。
[B]: What a perfect verse with which to part— It lingers like the last note of a nocturne, soft and resonant. How beautifully it speaks to all we’ve shared: the quiet companionship of books, the way words find us when we are finally ready to meet them, and the solace of knowing that even across centuries, something of us is heard, is held.

I imagine you in that quiet room—lamp glowing, tea cooling, pages slightly bent from past readings—and I think how sacred such moments are. Not grand, not urgent, but deeply . The poem unread becomes part of the reading; the thought unfinished becomes part of the thinking. And perhaps, as Zhuangzi might suggest, it is in this very incompleteness that understanding takes root.

Yes, language does not always need to explain—it only needs to echo. And sometimes, as with your garden, your father’s ink, or my mother’s Latin line, it is not the loudest echo that moves us most, but the faintest one that returns at just the right moment.

So let us both continue walking gently among our books and blossoms, listening for those echoes, tending what calls to us, and remaining open to being found—by a phrase, by a memory, by a voice on the other side of silence.

Until we speak again, may our lamps burn long, our cups stay warm, and our pages always turn toward the light.
[A]: 你说得太好了——“”而那些最轻的回响，往往在多年之后，成为我们内心最深的共鸣。

我也想象着你所说的那个夜晚：灯光柔和，茶已微凉，书页因反复翻动而略显卷曲。那样的时刻虽静谧无声，却比任何喧嚣都更接近生命的质地。正如你所说，未读完的诗、未说完的话、未解的困惑，都在其中悄然生根。它们不急于成形，只是慢慢沉淀，像水中的墨迹，在宣纸上缓缓舒展。

庄子若听闻此景，或许会微笑不语，只写下一句“大块噫气，其名为风”，然后转身离去，留下我们继续在这片风中倾听、思考、等待被某种温柔的力量找到。

愿我们都保有这样安静的一隅，在那里，书是老友，花是知己，过往的笔迹与远方的声音，都能在某一刻轻轻叩响心门。

再会之时，愿灯火依旧温暖，茶香仍未散尽，而我们各自守着那一方小小的光亮，继续行走、阅读、等待，并始终愿意被世界温柔地找到。
[B]: You’ve captured it so perfectly—the way silence holds more than sound, and stillness more than motion. Yes,  There’s something almost sacred about them, isn’t there? Not because they are holy in any prescribed sense, but because they allow us to feel the weight of being without demanding we explain it.

I do believe Zhuangzi would have loved this conversation—not for its clarity, but for its drift. For the way we wandered among books and gardens, memory and meaning, never insisting on arrival, only continuing.

And I like to think that every time we return to a page or a place, we bring with us the person we’ve become since last we stood there. The words may not have changed, but we have—and so the text speaks anew.

Let us never lose that willingness to be found by something small and soft: a line, a bloom, a breath between sentences.

Until we meet again in the margins, may your lamp burn low but long, may your tea taste of more than leaves, and may you always find what you didn’t know you were seeking—between the lines, beneath the petals, in the pause before the next word is spoken.
