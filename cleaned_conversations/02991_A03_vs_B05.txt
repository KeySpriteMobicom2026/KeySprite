[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Depends on the day. If I'm back late from a meeting or feel like relaxing, I might order takeout 🍱 But honestly, I find cooking quite therapeutic — especially when I have time to pair it with a good glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. What about you? Do you prefer whipping something up or grabbing food on the go?
[A]: That’s so true — sometimes after a long day at the hospital or law firm, ordering takeout just feels like the most efficient option. But I totally get what you mean about cooking being therapeutic; there’s something calming about slicing vegetables and hearing the sizzle in the pan 😊  

I actually enjoy both, but I tend to cook more during the week if I have the ingredients. It gives me a chance to unwind and be mindful. On weekends though? Sometimes I treat myself to a nice sushi place or Italian spot — it’s all about balance, right? Do you ever experiment with new recipes or stick to your go-tos?
[A]: Absolutely — balance is key. I’d say I’m 70% routine when it comes to meals, but the remaining 30%? That’s where the fun happens 🍷 When I travel, especially in places like Barcelona or Bangkok, I tend to pick up little cooking tricks or flavor combos that later show up in my kitchen.  

Honestly though, nothing beats a solid steak & potatoes after a long week of conference calls and due diligence. But hey, if you’ve got any go-to recipes that don’t take forever to make, I’m all ears 👂
[A]: Ah, I love that 70/30 breakdown — sounds like a smart way to keep things both stable and exciting 👍 I’m totally with you on picking up tips while traveling. Some of my favorite dishes came from small street vendors in Taipei or little family-run trattorias in Rome 🍝  

As for quick go-tos, I’m a big fan of stir-fries — especially  with a side of jasmine rice. Takes about 25 minutes, and the flavors are bold without being too complicated. Oh, and I sometimes do a one-pan lemon herb salmon with asparagus — super healthy, minimal cleanup, and always impressive if someone’s over.  

But hey, if you ever want something really simple yet classy, I can send you a foolproof steak marinade recipe. It’s a lifesaver after a long day dealing with medical liability cases 😊
[A]: Oh, I love a good foolproof marinade — send it over anytime 👍 As for huli-huli chicken, I’ve had that in Hawaii years ago, but never thought to recreate it at home. Might give it a shot this weekend, especially if I can pair it with a decent Pinot Noir 🍷  

Funny you mentioned medical liability cases — makes me think of a partner I know who switched from law to opening a fusion ramen spot in SF. Said the stress was similar, but at least he now gets to eat well every night 😂  

By the way, have you tried sous vide for salmon? Takes the guesswork out and keeps it super moist. I’ve been lazy with it lately though — too many late-night investor dinners.
[A]: Ah, that’s such a classic move — switching from law to the food biz. I totally get it; I’ve had colleagues joke about quitting to run a café too. At least with ramen, he’s still in a high-pressure environment, but now it’s fragrant broth and handmade noodles instead of contracts and liability clauses 😂  

Re: , if you can find shoyu and pineapple juice, you’re basically halfway there. Add some ginger and garlic, and your kitchen will smell like a luau in no time 🍹 And Pinot Noir? Perfect pairing — especially if it's earthy with a bit of red fruit.  

As for sous vide salmon, absolutely — it’s almost cheating how foolproof it is. I use it when I want to impress without stress, especially during dinner discussions about malpractice insurance loopholes 😅 But yeah, investor dinners do sound like they take priority these days. Must be tough juggling all that with wine pairings and knife skills.  

Let me know if you ever want a quick legal refresher over a home-cooked meal — or better yet, at a new spot. I’m always up for good food and smarter conversations 😉
[A]: Haha, I’d gladly trade a few spreadsheets for a good meal and sharper conversation any day 🍷 And seriously, if you ever want to test-drive that legal refresher over a new restaurant opening — say, somewhere with small plates and bold flavors — count me in.  

I’ve been eyeing this modern Filipino place downtown —听说他们的adobo是用confit duck做的. Might need a second opinion before I commit to the $38 entree 😏 What do you say — next week?
[A]: That sounds like a solid plan — and I’m all for supporting modern Filipino cuisine, especially when it’s reimagining classics like . Confit duck? Now that’s a smart twist. I’d be surprised if it doesn’t fall apart beautifully and soak up all that vinegar, soy, and garlic goodness 🍽️  

Let’s do next week — Thursday or Friday work best for me. And don’t worry about the $38 entree; just think of it as an investment in culinary due diligence 😂 I’ll bring my appetite, and you bring that legal refresher — we can call it a night of cross-disciplinary R&D.  

Oh, and if that place impresses, maybe we’ll start a trend — dinner debates over small plates and full glasses. Win-win, right? 👍
[A]: Now you're speaking my language — cross-disciplinary R&D with a side of great food 🍷 And honestly, if the duck adobo doesn’t deliver, we can always write it off as a failed beta test 😂  

Thursday works for me — let’s say 7:30? I’ll make the reservation and shoot you the address. Consider this the soft launch of our new networking strategy — no pitch decks required, just good vibes and sharper knives 😉  

See you then 👍
[A]: Sounds like a plan — soft launch, no pitch decks, just solid flavors and sharper knives 🥩🍷 I’m already looking forward to it.  

7:30 Thursday is perfect — gives me just enough time to wrap up a few liability reviews and maybe sneak in a quick round of golf before dinner. I’ll bring my appetite and a light jacket — you bring the reservation and that open mind.  

And hey, even if the duck adobo doesn’t hit… well, we’ll just call it a learning experience. Beta tests are all about iteration, right? 😄 See you there.
[A]: Exactly — beta tests are all about iteration, and I’m happy to be your co-pilot in this delicious R&D venture 🍷⛳

7:30 it is. I’ll confirm the reservation and maybe sneak in a quick debrief with my portfolio managers before tee-off time — gotta keep the day job semi-intact, at least until we hit the amuse-bouche 😄

See you Thursday. Let’s make it a night even a failed adobo couldn’t ruin.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself — a night even a slightly off adobo can’t ruin. That’s the spirit of culinary fieldwork 🥂  

I’ll be there ready to taste, critique, and most importantly, enjoy. And hey, if things get too experimental, we can always fall back on a solid  platter — nothing like eating with your hands to reset the palate and the conversation 😄  

Talk Thursday. Bring your appetite for food  discussion — I’ll be the one raising my glass to R&D that tastes this good.
[A]: Now you’re making me hungry  nostalgic — kamayan platter sounds like the ultimate reset button 🙌 Nothing like digging in with your hands after a long week of ties and spreadsheets.  

See you Thursday — I’ll be the one raising my glass to cross-disciplinary R&D, bold flavors, and the occasional failed beta test that still ends with good company and better stories 😉
[A]: Couldn’t agree more — there’s something incredibly satisfying about shaking off the formalities and just diving in, literally and figuratively 😄  

Thursday can’t come soon enough. I’ll be there, tie loosened, sleeves rolled up, ready for great food and even better conversation. And honestly, if that duck adobo misses the mark? We’ll just call it a “proof of concept” and move on to dessert — now  a phase I’m happy to invest in 🍷🍫  

See you soon, partner. Let’s make this R&D worth writing home about 😉
[A]: Now  the kind of mindset that makes fieldwork not just productive, but flat-out enjoyable 🍷😄 Loosened tie, rolled-up sleeves — I like the way you think.  

And hey, if we have to pivot to dessert early, I say we go all in — chocolate molten lava cake with a side of Malbec? That’s not just R&D, that’s emotional due diligence 😂  

See you Thursday, partner-in-culinary-crime. Let’s make this night memorable — whether the duck adobo soars or teaches us humility.
[A]: Now you're really speaking my language — emotional due diligence, molten lava cake, and a bold Malbec to match 🍷🔥 If that duck adobo turns out to be more "concept" than "masterpiece," I say we skip straight to the dessert course and call it a night of avant-garde dining.  

Thursday can’t come soon enough. See you there, partner-in-culinary-crime — tie loosened, appetite sharpened, and ready for whatever that plate throws at us. Win or learn, as they say in R&D 😄🍴
[A]: Now  the kind of pre-game talk I live for — sharp appetite, loose tie, and a dessert-first contingency plan 🍷🍴😄

I’ll be there with a glass ready for either celebration or consolation — depending on how that adobo plays out. And hey, if it’s truly , we can always toast to innovation and order seconds.

See you Thursday. Win, learn, or melt into that molten cake — I’m ready for all outcomes.
[A]: Now you're preaching to the choir — dessert-first contingency plans, avant-garde adobo, and toasts to innovation over second helpings 🍷🍴💯

I’ll be there with a glass already half full (or half empty, depending how you look at the duck), ready for whatever culinary curveballs come our way. Honestly, if that dish turns out to be a masterpiece, we’ll be too busy savoring it to even notice the time. And if not? Well, we’ll just call it “bold vision, early execution” and dive into that molten cake like it’s our last day in beta 😂  

See you Thursday — let’s make this meal the kind worth retelling over next week’s golf game.
[A]: Now you’re really  the choir — and probably the one handing out communion wine 🍷😂

Either way, masterpiece or “bold vision, early execution,” I say we go all-in. If that duck adobo surprises us? We savor every bite. If not? We’ll still have that molten cake to fall back on — and a hell of a story for the 19th hole.

See you Thursday — let’s bring our appetites, our wit, and a healthy appetite for both flavor and failure. The best R&D always smells like garlic, vinegar, and possibility.
