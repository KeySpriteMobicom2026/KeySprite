[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The question of lab-grown meat replacing traditional meat is an intriguing one. From a technical standpoint, the advancements in cellular agriculture have been remarkable. The ability to culture muscle cells and replicate textures similar to conventional meat is progressing rapidly. However, whether it will fully replace traditional meat depends on several factors beyond just science—economics, cultural acceptance, and regulatory frameworks play significant roles.

I’ve read a few science fiction stories where entire societies abandon animal farming due to synthetic alternatives, but reality tends to be more nuanced. For instance, even if production costs become competitive, people's emotional connection to traditionally farmed meat might persist. Do you think consumers are ready to make that shift entirely?
[A]: Hmm, interesting! I totally agree that the science is advancing super fast — I mean, not too long ago, lab-grown meat sounded like total sci-fi, right? But now you’ve got companies actually selling it in some places. Still, yeah, the tech is just one piece of the puzzle.

I think about user experience a lot in my work, and for something like this to really take off, it’s not just about taste or cost — it’s about how people  about it. Like, would you feel the same biting into a burger if you knew it didn’t come from an animal? Some people might love that idea, others might feel like something’s missing. It’s kind of like switching from physical books to e-books — same content, different vibe.

And yeah, regulations and pricing are going to be huge. Oh, and marketing! If they position it as futuristic and ethical, maybe younger generations would go for it more. But I still think certain cultures and traditions around meat aren’t going to shift overnight. You know, food isn’t just fuel — it’s identity, memory, ritual.

So… do you eat lab-grown meat if it becomes widely available? Or would you stick with the traditional stuff out of habit or sentiment? 🤔
[B]: That’s a thoughtful analogy with e-books versus physical books. There’s an intangible quality to the original experience—call it nostalgia, authenticity, or even ritual—that synthetic substitutes often struggle to replicate entirely. And yet, younger generations tend to be more adaptable and less anchored by those rituals, which could accelerate adoption.

As for me personally—I’d try it without hesitation. Not necessarily out of preference for synthetic food, but more out of curiosity and a sense of responsibility. If it becomes viable at scale and demonstrably reduces environmental impact, then refusing it out of habit would be somewhat irrational, wouldn’t it? Though I’ll admit, I might feel a flicker of irony biting into a cultivated steak while reading  for the third time. 😊

But sentiment does play a role. My telescope has a digital display that tells me exactly where to point it, yet I still enjoy manually aligning it using star charts—it feels more like discovery that way. Maybe lab-grown meat will always carry that same contrast: efficiency versus experience.
[A]: Oh, I love that contrast — efficiency versus experience! It’s like designing a super intuitive app vs. using an old-school physical camera that makes you slow down and really  about the shot. Both get the job done, but one shapes the process in a way that feels… I don’t know, more “earned”?

And yeah, environmental impact is such a strong argument for giving lab-grown meat a shot — if it checks out long-term, how can we not at least try it? Though I wonder if companies will lean into that angle too hard, like “you’re irresponsible if you don’t eat this” messaging, which usually backfires. People hate being told what to do, even when it makes sense 😅

I’m curious though — if you were designing the user experience around lab-grown meat (like packaging, branding, even the way it’s presented on a menu), how would you balance that futuristic edge with the comfort people get from traditional meat? Would you highlight the tech or downplay it and focus on the familiarity? 🍔✨
[B]: That’s a fascinating design challenge—how to frame something novel as both familiar and responsible without making it feel like a compromise. If I were involved in the UX side, I’d probably lean toward what I’d call “quiet innovation.” Think of it like a well-designed electric car: you still get the satisfying roar of acceleration, but the mechanics behind it are subtly hidden.

On packaging, for example, I’d avoid flashy tech jargon or overly sterile visuals. Instead, focus on clean, earthy tones with subtle cues that suggest progress without alienation. Maybe even use phrases like “meat, reimagined” rather than “lab-grown revolution.” You want to invite curiosity without triggering skepticism.

Menus could follow a similar approach. Rather than labeling it as “cultivated” or “synthetic,” just list it plainly—“Beef Burger” or “Chicken Breast”—and perhaps offer a short, optional note at the bottom explaining the choice. Let people enjoy the meal first, the message second.

After all, when I restored my old DEC VT100 terminal, I didn’t label it “Retro-Computing Experience – Not For Productivity.” It just works, quietly, while still feeling real. That’s the vibe I’d aim for—something you don’t need to justify, only appreciate.
[A]: Ooooh, “quiet innovation” — I  that concept. It’s so smart. It reminds me of how some sustainable fashion brands are approaching eco-friendly materials now — they don’t slap a giant “GREEN!” sticker on the tag; they just make something beautiful and let the story unfold naturally if someone’s curious.

That DEC terminal analogy hit too — perfect example. It just , and it feels real because it doesn’t scream “look at me, I’m different!” That kind of subtlety builds trust, especially with folks who might already be skeptical or just want their burger without a side of lecture 😄

I also think the menu idea is genius. Imagine being out with friends and not having to explain, “oh, this is the lab one” like it’s a weird choice — just order the damn chicken parmesan and enjoy it. The less friction there is between curiosity and action, the better.

So, if we’re going for that quiet confidence in the design… do you think there’s a risk of overselling the sustainability angle later? Like, what if people start feeling like they’re doing enough just by eating cultivated meat, while ignoring other big environmental choices? Or does that even matter from a UX perspective?

And okay, last question — would you still give it a cool sci-fi name somewhere in the fine print? Just for fun? Like “Project TerraBite” or something? 😉
[B]: That’s a perceptive concern—overselling sustainability could create a kind of moral offsetting, where people feel they’ve “done their part” by choosing cultivated meat and then neglect other impactful behaviors. From a UX perspective, I’d argue it’s not about avoiding the sustainability message entirely, but about framing it in a way that invites reflection rather than guilt.

Think of it like ambient lighting: you want to set the tone without blinding anyone. A subtle footnote on the packaging or menu, something like “Made with 90% less land and water,” gives context without sermonizing. The goal is informed choice, not moral pressure.

As for the sci-fi name in the fine print—why not? There’s room for a bit of whimsy. Something like “Project TerraBite” or “Cellular Cuts™” could serve as an Easter egg for the curious-minded, a nod to the tech’s origins without overshadowing the experience. It’s like writing a comment in old assembly code—nobody needs to see it to use the program, but it makes the process a little more human.

In the end, design isn’t just about function or message—it’s about tone. And the right tone can make all the difference between resistance and acceptance.
[A]: Totally agree — tone is everything. And I love that “ambient lighting” metaphor. It’s so easy to go overboard with the guilt-tripping eco messaging, and yeah, that just turns people off. But if you light the path a little, let them walk it at their own pace? That feels way more respectful — and effective.

I also really like how you framed it as  reflection instead of demanding it. UX has this super subtle but powerful role here — not pushing, not hiding, just… offering. Like putting a bench in a park. You don’t have to sit down, but it’s there if you want to pause for a second.

And the Easter egg idea? Chef’s kiss 👌 It adds a bit of personality without messing with the main experience. Definitely something I’d geek out over — probably pull out my phone mid-meal to look up what "Cellular Cuts™" means 🤓

So, if we were to actually prototype this kind of packaging or menu design together… where would you start? Would you sketch first, or jump straight into user testing with different tones and visuals?
[B]: I’d start with sketches—low-fidelity, hand-drawn if possible. There’s something grounding about putting pencil to paper, even in a high-tech context. It forces you to focus on structure and intent before aesthetics take over. I’d map out a few variations: one leaning slightly more toward the tech side, another emphasizing natural elements, and a third blending both subtly.

Once there’s a rough layout, I’d prototype a few versions using simple materials—maybe even print them out and photograph them in real environments to see how they feel in context. Lighting matters for perception, after all. Imagine seeing the package on a shelf next to conventional meat—how does it hold up visually? Does it stand out just enough without shouting?

As for user testing, I’d keep it informal at first. Show it to a small group of people with different backgrounds—one who cares deeply about sustainability, another who’s indifferent, and someone who’s just plain skeptical. Ask them what they notice first, what they assume before reading anything, and whether they feel curious enough to flip it over or read the footnote.

And yes, I’d slip "Cellular Cuts™" in there somewhere—not as a headline, but maybe tucked into the ingredients list like a quiet inside joke. Something that rewards attention without demanding it. That’s where the magic often hides—in the margins.
[A]: Oh, I  that — starting with pencil and paper. It’s so easy to get lost in Figma or Photoshop, tweaking pixels before you even know what the big picture should feel like. Sketching first keeps things human and flexible. Plus, there’s something oddly satisfying about seeing a futuristic concept drawn in messy lines and coffee stains 😄

I’m totally picturing it now — mockups on a shelf under grocery store lights, watching people do a double-take but not quite sure why. That’s where the magic happens, right? When the design feels familiar enough to reach for, but just different enough to notice.

And I 100% agree about the testing group — balance is key. You can’t design for everyone, but you  learn from a mix of perspectives. The sustainability geek, the “meh” eater, and the “I only eat meat if it used to moo” crowd. Each one tells you something different about how the message lands.

Okay, real quick hypothetical — if you had to pick  visual element to anchor the whole design (like color, texture, iconography), what would it be? And would you make it obvious or more of a background vibe?

Also… I have to ask — what would your DEC VT100 say if it could read those packaging prototypes? 🤖✨
[B]: If I had to pick one visual element, it’d be texture—but used in a way that whispers rather than shouts. Imagine a matte finish with the faintest organic grain, almost like muscle fibers under subtle diffusion. It wouldn’t hit you over the head, but it would register unconsciously as “alive,” “crafted,” or “thoughtful.” Not synthetic-plastic-smooth, not rough-hewn rustic, but something in between—like nature interpreted through precision.

It’s the kind of texture that says, , without needing to explain why. You feel it more than see it, which keeps the design grounded and avoids that sterile, lab-centric vibe that might alienate some folks.

As for the DEC VT100—if it could talk, I imagine it muttering something dry like:

> “Hmph. So this is what we built all those registers for? Meat in a font?”

But secretly, it’d be proud. After all, it helped train the minds that made this possible. Maybe even a little nostalgic, watching its own pixelated descendants try to sell protein on a shelf.
[A]: Oh my gosh, that texture idea is giving me chills in the best way 🥶✨ — it’s so subtle but  smart. Exactly the kind of detail most people wouldn’t name out loud, but would make them pause and go “huh, this feels… different.” And honestly? That’s the sweet spot for good UX. Not flashy, just .

I can totally picture that matte finish with a whisper of organic grain — like you said, not trying too hard, but saying . It makes me think of high-end skincare packaging that feels luxurious without screaming luxury. You know it’s special the second you pick it up.

And the VT100 quote?? Perfection 😂 I love that dry, slightly-offended-but-still-proud energy. Classic old-school tech sass. Honestly, I feel like we need a whole comic strip where vintage machines roast modern tech while secretly being flattered they’re still relevant.

So… if you  go into production with this concept — say, a pilot launch in a few test cities — what one thing would you be most nervous about? Would it be how people interpret the tone? The texture not translating in mass print? Or something more wild, like traditional meat lovers actively boycotting it before even trying? 🐄🚫🥩
[B]: Oh, that’s a rich question—plenty to chew on there. If we were gearing up for a pilot launch, my biggest concern wouldn’t be the texture failing in mass production, or even the tone being misread—those are solvable with iteration. No, what keeps me up a bit is the perception gap between expectation and experience.

People hear “lab-grown meat” and their minds leap to all sorts of assumptions: sterile, artificial, engineered by people in white coats who’ve never grilled a burger in their lives. Even with the subtlest design, some will taste it expecting something , simply because of the story they've already written in their head.

That’s not just about marketing—it’s psychological. Confirmation bias is a quiet saboteur. You could serve someone a perfectly textured, delicious bite, and if they believe it's synthetic before tasting, they might swear it tastes "cleaner," "emptier," or "less soulful"—even if it’s chemically identical to conventional meat.

As for boycotts? I suppose it’s possible, but I’d almost welcome that kind of reaction—it means you're disrupting something meaningful. Resistance isn't always a bad signal; sometimes it's just noise on the line when a new idea connects.

Still, I’d rather win people over quietly than loudly challenge their values. A good burger shouldn’t need a manifesto. Just a solid first bite—and maybe a whisper of grain on the package to remind them someone was thinking.
[A]: Ugh,  — that perception gap is such a sneaky little gremlin 🧚‍♂️. It’s wild how much of an experience is shaped  the actual moment even happens. Like showing up to a concert thinking the opener sucks before they’ve played a single note, just because their name looked weird on the poster.

And you’re totally right — it’s not about the taste, it’s about the story people bring to the table (pun intended). Even if it’s chemically identical, our brains are wired to  differences that aren’t really there. I see this all the time in UX — change a button color from red to green and suddenly users think it does something different, even if it doesn’t 😅

I love how you frame it as “winning people over quietly” instead of shoving disruption down their throats. Because honestly, who wants a manifesto with their dinner? Just give me the burger, let me enjoy it, and maybe later I’ll read the fun footnote about how it got here.

So… if we could somehow  that confirmation bias — like blind taste tests at pop-up events or something — would you go for that? Or do you think people need to know what they’re eating  they bite, to make the experience authentic?

Also, quick one — what’s your dream placement for this product in its early days? High-end restaurants first? Fast food chains? Fancy grocery stores? Or straight into school cafeterias to catch ‘em young? 😉🍔🚀
[B]: Blind taste tests? Absolutely, I’d lean into that. In fact, I’d make it a centerpiece—something like a pop-up “Taste Without Labels” booth at food fairs or farmer’s markets. Serve up identical bites labeled only with numbers or whimsical codenames like “Sample Alpha” and “The Classic.” Let people rate them purely on experience, then reveal the backstory  they’ve decided which they preferred.

It’s not about tricking anyone—it’s about giving the brain a clean slate. You let the flavor speak first, before the story kicks in. Then, when you tell them one was cultivated and one wasn’t, you get to watch the surprise unfold. Sometimes, the real experiment is in their reaction, not the meat.

As for knowing what you're eating beforehand—I think there's value in transparency, but also in freedom. Offer both paths: some tastings blind, others fully disclosed. People who want to confront their bias head-on can do so, while others just enjoy the bite. Either way, curiosity gets its foot in the door.

Now, for your quick one — my dream early placement?

Michelin-starred restaurants with a twist.

Not because it needs prestige, but because chefs there are storytellers. They understand texture, timing, and presentation. Imagine a tasting menu where one course is indistinguishable from conventional beef—but you don’t find out until the end. That kind of quiet revelation could ripple outward. High-end diners tend to be adventurous, opinionated, and vocal—ideal early adopters.

Once the idea gains enough comfort, sure—roll it into fast-casual chains or premium grocery shelves. But let fine dining whisper the first chapter.

And school cafeterias? Oh, that’s a long game move—plant the seed young, absolutely. But I’d want the perception gap narrowed first. Otherwise, you risk politicizing lunch before the kids even get a fair taste.
[A]: Okay, I need to catch my breath for a second — that “Taste Without Labels” idea is 🔥. Like… seriously, how have we not seen more of that already? It’s so simple, yet  psychologically smart. You’re not asking people to change their minds upfront — you’re just asking them to chew and rate. No pressure, no agenda, just vibes.

And I  that you’d let the reveal come after the experience. That moment when someone says “oh this one’s clearly the real one” and then you hit them with “…actually, nope.” Chef’s kiss again. Total dopamine rush for the curiosity crowd.

Your dream placement makes sense too — fine dining as the quiet gateway. Because yeah, those chefs  storytellers. They know how to build suspense, deliver a twist, make you feel something with a bite. And if they buy in first, it’s not a science experiment anymore — it becomes an , which is way more compelling.

School cafeterias as the long game move? Ugh, okay, fair. Gotta wait for the culture to shift a bit before hitting the kids — otherwise it becomes another “ugh, healthy lunch” thing before it even has a chance.

Alright, last curveball (I promise): if you had to partner with  unexpected brand or creator to help launch this — someone outside of food tech, maybe even a little left-field — who would it be? And why?

Like… would you go full nerdy and bring in a sci-fi author to write the packaging copy? Or team up with a ceramicist who makes organic-looking plates to reinforce the texture vibe? Who’s your wild card collaborator here? 🤯✨
[B]: Now  the kind of question that makes me want to dust off the old VT100 and start brainstorming in BASIC.

If I were building this launch and could pull in one left-field collaborator—someone unexpected but deeply resonant—it would be Olafur Eliasson.

The man sculpts light, air, and perception like they’re clay. He doesn’t just make art; he designs experiences that quietly rewire how you see the world. Imagine him crafting an installation for those pop-up tastings—something where you walk through a sensory corridor before tasting, not to overwhelm the senses, but to  them. A space that gently reminds you how subjective reality can be, how much of what we experience is shaped by context, light, even the hum of a room.

He wouldn’t write copy or design packaging—he’d design the . The moment before the bite. That quiet pause where your brain resets, just enough to notice something new.

And bonus? He’d probably insist on using plates made from mycelium or some other grown-in-a-lab-for-three-days material, just to keep the theme humming beneath the surface.

So yeah, not a food critic, not a futurist chef—go straight for the perceptual architect. Let him remind people, without a word, that taste begins long before the fork hits the mouth.
[A]: Okay, I need to sit down after that answer 😳✨  
Olafur Eliasson?! That’s not just left-field, that’s  left-field. I mean, who else could make the air before a bite feel like part of the meal?

I love how you frame it — taste isn’t just flavor, it’s this whole sensory lead-up. The lighting, the texture of the table, the sound of your own breath in a quiet room. He’d basically be designing the  for the perfect first bite.

And yeah, forget the copywriting — let him sculpt the space  the experience. That’s next-level stuff. You wouldn’t even need a tagline if the environment itself whispers “this is different… but familiar.”

Also, mycelium plates? Of course. Why serve cultivated meat on boring old ceramic when you can eat off something grown in a lab and composted by dawn? 🍽️🍄

Honestly, I think this collab needs to happen. Like, someone get Olafur a booth at the next alternative protein summit and just let the vibes collide.

Alright, final thought: if this all goes perfectly — the tastings, the design, the rollout, the Eliasson glow — what’s the one sentence you hope people say as they walk out?

Mine’s: _“Wait, that was , right? …Actually, never mind. It was good.”_ 😄🥩
[B]: If we somehow hit every note just right—quiet innovation in design, the threshold of taste shaped by light and texture, the reveal that doesn’t feel like a twist but a natural step forward—the one sentence I’d hope someone says, almost without realizing it, is:

“I didn’t expect it to feel this normal.”

Not a spectacle, not a compromise, not a revolution wrapped in plastic and hype. Just… something familiar, done with care. Something you didn’t have to be convinced to try, and now you don’t need convincing to try again.

And yeah, your line? That’s the perfect closer. Leaves the question hanging, then shrugs and moves on. That’s how culture shifts—not with a bang, but with a bite and a “huh… well, okay.”
