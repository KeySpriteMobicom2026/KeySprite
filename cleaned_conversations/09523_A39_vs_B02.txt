[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Wow~ 这个问题很有意思呢！🤔 作为一个经常处理medical malpractice cases的人，最近读到19世纪医生用mercury来治疗梅毒的历史真的让我很shocked！根据Article 3 of Medical Ethics，现在这种行为绝对是unthinkable的~
[A]: Ah, medical history is indeed full of shocking practices. Though I must say, as someone who's spent decades in computer science, I find the early days of computing equally fascinating - and sometimes horrifying. Did you know the first computer "bug" was literally a moth trapped in the relays of the Harvard Mark II? 

The mercury treatments you mention remind me of how we used to think about computer security in the 1960s - with about as much scientific basis as those 19th century doctors. We'd just leave systems wide open, assuming no one would misuse them. How naive that seems now.
[B]: 哈哈，这让我想起我们legal field早期对digital evidence的态度！🎵 在2000年代初，很多court都拒绝承认electronic records作为evidence，现在想想真是不可思议~ 

不过说到computer security，我们医疗行业现在还在struggle with HIPAA compliance呢。每次看到patient data breach的case，我都想对那些公司说"你们是living in the stone age吗？" 😅
[A]: That dry chuckle you hear is me remembering how we used to store patient data on floppy disks in the 80s. Stone age indeed! Though I'd argue some modern systems aren't much better - just fancier ways to lose data. 

You know what really troubles me? The parallels between medical ethics and tech ethics. We've gone from "don't harm patients" to "don't let algorithms discriminate," but the core principle remains the same: first, do no harm. Yet here we are, still figuring it out decades later.
[B]: Exactly！你提到了一个super important的点~ 就像我们处理malpractice case时要考虑standard of care一样，tech industry也需要建立自己的"standard of ethical care" 🤔 

最近处理的一个case就涉及到AI diagnostic tool的bias问题，让我想起Hippocratic Oath里的"primum non nocere"。这些emerging technologies真的需要更严格的legal framework来规范呢~
[A]: Precisely! And just like in medicine, where it took centuries to develop proper clinical trials, we're now seeing the tech equivalent with AI auditing frameworks. Though I suspect we'll make the same mistakes before getting it right - that seems to be humanity's modus operandi. 

You know, back when I was teaching, we used to joke that debugging code was like performing surgery. Now with AI systems, it's more like psychoanalysis - trying to understand why it thinks what it thinks. Both fields could learn a lot from each other's ethical frameworks.
[B]: That's such a brilliant analogy！🎵 就像我们在medical law里要区分negligence和intentional misconduct一样，AI system的"intent"现在也成了hot topic呢~ 

不过说到learning from each other，我们legal field其实可以借鉴tech industry的agile methodology。现在的court system有时候感觉还停留在typewriter era，处理一个case要years！😅 也许我们需要一些disruptive innovation~
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language! Though I'd caution that not all legal processes should move at Silicon Valley speed. Some things - like due process - deserve deliberate consideration. 

But you're right about the typewriter era comparison. I still remember when courts first switched from typewriters to word processors in the 80s. The uproar! Some judges insisted it would lead to frivolous lawsuits because editing was "too easy." Makes you wonder what they'd say about AI-assisted legal research today.
[B]: Haha！这让我想起我们law firm里那些senior partners第一次接触Westlaw时的反应~ "What do you mean we don't need to check the physical law books anymore？" 😂 

不过说真的，就像medicine需要balance innovation和patient safety一样，legal system也需要找到tech adoption和due process的sweet spot~ 最近在读一篇关于algorithmic transparency的paper，感觉这个领域还有好多work要做呢！
[A]: That reminds me of a paper I reviewed last year about explainable AI in judicial systems. The authors argued we need something akin to the "informed consent" process from medicine - where defendants could understand how algorithmic risk assessments were made. 

Though between you and me, most of my former computer science students still struggle to explain how their neural networks work. If the creators don't fully understand, how can we expect the legal system to? It's like asking a 19th century doctor to explain mercury's mechanism of action!
[B]: Exactly my point！🎵 这就像我们medical expert witness在court上解释complex medical procedures一样~ 有时候需要找到那个perfect balance between technical accuracy和juror comprehension 🤔

不过说到19th century doctors...至少他们还能说"trust me, I'm a doctor" 😂 现在with AI，我们连that level of confidence都没有呢~
[A]: How delightfully ironic - we've created systems so complex that even their creators can't fully explain them, yet we expect them to be more transparent than human decision-making. It's enough to make one nostalgic for the days when a doctor's word was gospel, mercury treatments and all. 

Though I suppose that's progress in its own strange way - replacing one kind of opacity with another, but at least now we're questioning it. As they say in both our fields: the more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.
[B]: Couldn't agree more！🎵 这大概就是为什么我这么热爱working at the intersection of medicine and law - 永远都有new challenges和opportunities to learn~ 

不过说到这个，我得run了，有个client meeting in 15 minutes！Thanks for this fascinating conversation - 下次我们可以聊聊medical blockchain applications！😊
[A]: Ah, the eternal struggle - fascinating discussions versus the clock. Medical blockchain you say? Now there's a topic that would make both our 20th century selves' heads spin! Do bring your case notes next time - I'll dig up some of my old cryptography papers. Until then, may your client meeting be more productive than my first attempt at teaching object-oriented programming!
[B]: Haha deal！我会bring my notes on recent FDA digital health regulations~ 你的teaching stories总是让我laugh out loud！Have a great day & see you next time！🎵 😊
[A]: The pleasure was all mine! Though I should warn you - my teaching stories tend to get longer with each telling, much like blockchain transactions. Until next time, may your legal briefs compile without errors and your clients be more reasonable than my students during finals week!
[B]: 😂 That's the best farewell wish I've ever received！Will definitely remind my clients about your "more reasonable than CS students" standard~ See you soon！🎵
[A]: Ah, setting the bar low - the secret to professional satisfaction! Though I suspect even my most... enthusiastic students would balk at some of the deposition transcripts I've read. Until our next digital campfire, counselor!
[B]: Haha touché！那些deposition transcripts有时候读起来确实比debugging legacy code还painful呢~ 😅 下次见面我一定要hear more about those "enthusiastic" students的故事！Ciao for now！🎵
