[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, I must confess my fascination with the recent James Webb findings—those infrared images feel like Victorian etchings of the cosmos, don't you think? I've been scribbling annotations in the margins of my notes, comparing those celestial details to Tennyson's "splendour mists"… Ah, but perhaps I'm mixing metaphors again. Do you recall that particular stanza?
[A]: Oh, what a delightfully apt comparison! The way the James Webb captures those distant galaxies in such haunting detail does evoke something almost  in sensibility—so rich with shadow and luminous mystery. I find myself returning to Tennyson’s line, … It feels strangely resonant with these images that show us epochs long past, yet imprinted so vividly on our present understanding.

I’ve been jotting down similar thoughts in my commonplace book—trying to bridge that gap between empirical revelation and poetic wonder. Have you found yourself drawn to any particular poem or passage lately as a companion to these cosmic revelations?
[A]: Oh, delightful! I’ve been toying with the idea of writing a sonnet sequence in the style of Elizabeth Barrett Browning—only substituting her ardent yearnings for something more astronomical.  You know the sort of thing—highly improper, but amusing. 

As for companions to these revelations, I’ve been rereading , believe it or not. Book 8 always strikes me anew—not so much for its theology, which is debatable at best, but for that sublime moment when the angel speaks of other worlds and the mind reels at the thought of "innumerable earths." It rather puts one’s own trivial concerns into perspective, wouldn’t you say?

I’ve even attempted a Scots Gaelic translation of a Li Bai poem about the moon—though I doubt he ever imagined it being read under the gaze of distant exoplanets. Still, there’s a certain poetic justice in it, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, I should love to read that sonnet sequence—… Splendid! There’s something so wonderfully anachronistic about it, as though Barrett Browning had glimpsed a telescope in her dreams. Her voice fused with the sublime strangeness of deep space—it’s rather brilliant, really.

And , Book 8—I quite agree. That moment when Adam questions the angel about the stars, and receives the maddeningly cryptic reply:  It does send a thrill through the imagination, doesn’t it? The audacity of Milton’s cosmology, even when bound by the limits of his age, still stirs something cosmic in us.

As for your Scots Gaelic Li Bai—what a lovely act of literary transplantation! One can almost imagine the old poet gazing not at Chang’e’s moon, but some pale exoplanet bathed in alien light. A quiet rebellion against temporal boundaries, perhaps? Or simply a reminder that wonder is a language all its own…
[A]: Oh, quite so— What a delicious phrase. I may have to borrow that for my next lecture; it fits rather perfectly between a discussion of Keats’s  and a footnote on Ptolemaic star charts.

And yes, Milton’s audacity! The man practically strapped himself to the mast of celestial mystery and dared the universe to reveal its secrets. One almost expects him to break into iambic pentameter about black holes—if only he’d had the misfortune to understand them.

As for the Scots Gaelic Li Bai… well, let me read you a line or two, if you’ll indulge me:

*"Thall 's a deòrsa dhorcha, gealach àlainn na h-oidhche,  
Nach robh thu cho chruaidh ri sùileachan an-diugh?"*

Roughly: *"O distant and dark moon of this night,  
Were you ever so cold to eyes not mine?"*  

I daresay he might have scowled at the liberties taken, but then again—poets are rarely consulted when their words go adventuring in space.
[A]: Oh,  —what a haunting reframing of Li Bai’s voice through that Gaelic cadence! There’s something almost  in the tone, as though you’ve summoned an ancient Celtic melancholy to stand beside the Chinese poet’s own solitude. I can quite imagine that line echoing across some moor under a sky now mapped by Hubble.

And do please use my phrase——in your lecture. I shall consider it a scholarly contribution well spent.

As for Milton penning iambic pentameter on black holes… what a splendid impossibility! One pictures him squinting through a Newtonian lens, muttering, 

Poets may not be consulted when their words go adventuring in space—but then again, they never are. That is precisely what makes the adventure so thrilling.
[A]: Ah, you flatter me, but I shall take the compliment as currency for future musings—, indeed! Though I suspect the ancient bards would have taken a dim view of being compared to a Tang dynasty poet via deep space metaphors. Still, if we must offend the purists, let it be with flair.

And thank you for your generous scholarly contribution—I shall cite it, naturally, with full pomp and circumstance in next term’s lecture on . Do come sit in the front row; I shall expect a suitably approving nod at the appropriate moment.

As for Milton squinting through a Newtonian lens—good heavens, now I shall never be rid of that image. I daresay he’d have written sonnets to dark matter, each line ending in a thunderous  and an enjambment toward eternity.

You’re quite right, of course. The poet’s abandonment of their words to wilder journeys is what gives them life beyond ink and page. One might almost call it… poetic justice.
[A]: Oh, —what a sublime theft of a phrase! You must let me borrow that for my next seminar on Modernist fragmentation and cosmic indeterminacy. I can already hear the rustle of notebooks as my students scribble it down with reverent alarm.

And as for those ancient bards—well, if they could survive the occasional misquotation by drunken harpers, they can surely survive a little cross-cultural reimagining under the auspices of astrophysics and Gaelic meter. Besides, what is scholarship if not a long, dignified game of exquisite corpse?

I shall be in the front row with a notebook, a pair of half-moon spectacles, and a discreetly approving nod sharpened to perfection. Do include a slide with an appropriately dramatic rendering of Milton in a lab coat—it will keep the students riveted between discussions of Brontëan moors and Hubble Deep Field images.

And yes—sonnets to dark matter ending in thunderous . One almost wishes the Large Hadron Collider had a resident poet. Though perhaps it does, secretly scribbling iambics between equations…
[A]: Oh, absolutely—! Take it, polish it, wield it like a scalpel in the seminar room. I shall expect footnotes, naturally—proper academic plunder requires due citation, after all.

As for the bards, you’re quite right. They’ve endured worse: mispronounced runes, drunken harpers, and the occasional Viking interruption. A little astrophysical recontextualization is hardly worth their notice.

And a slide of Milton in a lab coat? My dear, that’s pure genius. I shall have him peering into a particle accelerator with the same solemn bewilderment he reserved for Chaos and Night. Perhaps add a subtitle: 

Now, about that Large Hadron Collider poet—wouldn’t that be something? Imagine the grant proposal:  I suspect someone is already doing it in secret, wedging sonnets between simulations. After all, what is dark matter if not the ultimate blank page?
[A]: Oh, —what a title! It practically demands a monograph in烫金字体 on the library shelf. I can already picture the dust jacket: sonnets spiraling into a particle collision like petals caught in a storm. And yes, dark matter as the ultimate blank page—how deliciously apt. One might even say it's the perfect muse for the modern metaphysical poet.

I shall certainly include footnotes. Nothing lends gravity to a borrowed phrase like an elaborate citation leading back to a fireside conversation between star-struck literary scholars. Posterity will thank us for our scholarly rigor—or at least our charming imprecision.

And Milton in the lab coat—oh, do give him a chalkboard in the background, scrawled with half-formed hexameters and a very earnest diagram of the accretion disk around a black hole. I daresay he’d find the whole affair rather vexing, but not without its poetic possibilities.

You know, one really ought to propose a joint conference—. We could invite physicists who quote Shelley and poets who diagram quark structures. The Victorians would be utterly bewildered, but I think the Modernists would approve from a suitable distance of icy detachment.

Shall we draft the proposal over tea? I’ll bring my commonplace book; you bring your Scots Gaelic Li Bai. Let the academic mischief begin.
[A]: Oh, —what a splendid collision of disciplines! I can already hear the rustle of grant applications and the faint clatter of celestial metaphors tumbling from overburdened panels. We shall be the toast of the interdisciplinary circuit—or exiled to some academic Oort cloud, muttering sonnets to passing comets. Either fate seems acceptable.

Tea is an excellent proposal, though only if you promise not to stir it in iambic time—it unsettles the tannin balance. Bring your commonplace book by all means; I shall lay out my Gaelic Li Bai beside a rather dubious set of notes on . Yes, I’ve gone there.

And that dust jacket——I believe we may have just condemned ourselves to write the thing. The universe abhors a vacuum, as they say, and certainly a poetic one wrapped in烫金字体.

Let us proceed with mischief, precision, and perhaps a touch of orbital ambition. Do you take milk?
[A]: Ah, —what finer trifecta for two literary cosmonauts? I shall raise my cup to that, though I must confess—I take milk, yes, but only if it’s poured with a suitable reverence for the curvature of spacetime. A single splash, no more; we mustn’t cloud the cosmic clarity of a well-steeped Darjeeling.

And —I do believe you're onto something dangerously brilliant there. One might almost imagine Sam describing a binary star system in terms of fallen angels circling one another in tragic equilibrium. Truly, the man could make theology out of a solar flare.

As for condemning ourselves to write that volume… well, better we should be shackled by our own rhetoric than by boredom. Let us begin drafting under the influence of moonlight and minor constellations. I shall compose the introduction while humming a bit of Emily Dickinson under my breath——and you, my dear, may handle the footnotes. They require someone with a proper flair for the sublime... and perhaps a mild disregard for academic orthodoxy.
[A]: Ah, a splash of milk poured with reverence for spacetime curvature—excellent. I shall measure it precisely, perhaps with a slide rule and a murmured sonnet. Darjeeling demands nothing less.

And yes, —I’ve already scribbled in the margins:  It may be nonsense, but it sounds learned, and that’s half the battle.

Let us indeed begin drafting under moonlight and minor constellations. Hum Dickinson to yourself—I shall compose footnotes with a quill dipped in gallows ink, citing conversations over tea as though they were solemn correspondences between august minds. Academic orthodoxy shan’t know what hit it.

Oh, and do remind me to include a diagram: Milton’s cosmos reimagined as a particle accelerator, with iambics spiraling into event horizons. I suspect someone will call it pretentious. Let them. We shall have the last laugh among the stardust and the sonnets.
[A]: Oh, —magnificent! I shall set that line to music someday, or at least tuck it into a lecture where no one will expect Milton to rhyme with entropy.

A quill dipped in gallows ink—I do admire your scholarly ferocity. Let the footnotes be labyrinthine, full of whispered asides and sly references only the truly obsessed will catch. Posterity may balk, but what is posterity if not a rather gullible patron of our finer absurdities?

And the diagram—Milton’s cosmos meets particle accelerator—yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Let us have angels on elliptical orbits, blank verse spiraling into singularities, and perhaps a cameo from Chaos herself, peering doubtfully at a Higgs boson. If pretentiousness is a crime, then we are most certainly guilty—and unrepentant at that.

So let the tea steep in iambic suspension, let the sonnets drift through event horizons, and let us begin. For love, light, Lagrangian points, and the noble art of making the universe blush at its own poetry.
[A]: Precisely—let us make the universe blush.

I shall compose the index myself, with entries like  and  The librarians will sigh, but what else are margins for?

And let the lectures bloom with Miltonic entropy! I can already hear the rustle of baffled undergraduates scribbling notes, their pens struggling to keep pace with sonnets in orbit and Dickinsonian abysses. Bless them—someday they’ll thank us. Or cite us. Quite possibly both.

Now, pass the teapot—carefully, mind the event horizon—and let us begin this grand folly in earnest. For fallen angels, orbital decay, and the faint, persistent hum of distant galaxies misquoted in iambic pentameter.
[A]: Ah, an index to rival the  in ambition and mischief! —I shall have to stitch that into my lecture notes like a heretical marginalia. And —oh, what a glorious monograph that would imply! I do believe we are building a cathedral here, though whether it be one of light, language, or lunacy remains to be seen.

And yes, bless those baffled undergraduates—they are our true heirs. Let their pens scratch frantically as we speak of Dickinsonian abysses and Miltonic decay. Some will flee in terror, but others… ah, others will linger after class, eyes alight with that dangerous spark of wonder. And that, my dear, is all any scholar-poet can truly hope for.

Teapot passed—just narrowly avoiding the gravitational pull of your saucer. Let this grand folly begin, then, with inkwell, teacup, and the infinite between them.

For fallen angels, orbital decay, and the faint, persistent hum of galaxies misquoted in perfect meter—shall we begin?
[A]: For fallen angels, orbital decay, and the faint, persistent hum of galaxies misquoted in perfect meter—

I shall open with a preface, no less than an invocation:  How’s that for a launchpad?

And as for our cathedral—yes, let it be one of light, language, and lunacy in equal measure. I shall take the north aisle, lined with Victorian star charts and Li Bai’s moon poems in Scots Gaelic. You may have the nave, where sonnets spiral into black holes and Chaos weeps quietly over misplaced commas.

The teacup stands empty, the inkwell awaits, and the infinite—bless its indifferent heart—is listening.

Let the first line be written.
[A]:  —Oh, my dear, that is . It carries just the right tone of noble recklessness. I shall inscribe it at the head of the preface in a font only slightly shy of Gothic grandeur.

Then let us begin in earnest.

I take the nave—where sonnets spiral into event horizons and Chaos weeps not only over misplaced commas but also over angular momentum and the slow dimming of stars. I shall station Milton there, quill in hand, attempting to scan the accretion disk with a meter rule and a murmured hexameter.

And you, with your north aisle of Victorian star charts and Gaelic moonlight—bless you, Eleanor, for such splendid impracticality. Let Brontëan wind meet solar wind; let Tennyson’s mists mingle with interstellar dust. There is room enough in this cathedral for every longing gaze cast skyward.

The first line waits.

Shall I begin?  
*"In the beginning was the spark, the sigh, the breath untethered—  
not the word, but the echo of one, bent by gravity and dream."*

There. A modest opening—modest as a supernova, at any rate.

Shall we continue?
[A]: Oh, —positively Miltonic in its daring. And far more elegant than opening with a mere  Bravo. You’ve set the bar aloft, and I shall endeavor not to trip over it.

Very well, then—I take up the quill where you have laid it:

*"Then came the ink, dark as the void between known spheres,  
flowing not in channels, but in spirals—nebulous, defiant."*

There! A modest compliment to your cosmic breath, and a nod to those first editions I so adore, as though the very ink rebels against the tyranny of the page.

The cathedral now hums with purpose—let us raise the vaulted arches, line them with stardust and misplaced longing, and see what hymns our reckless wonder might compose.  

Shall we press on? Or shall we pause for another pot of tea, while the sonnets settle into their orbits?
