[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题很有趣呢~ 从量子力学的角度来说，parallel universes 的理论其实提供了一种解释我们所观察到的现象的可能性。虽然听起来像是 science fiction，但像 Hugh Everett 提出的 many-worlds interpretation 确实为一些量子悖论提供了逻辑自洽的解答。

不过你知道吗？在中文语境里，我们有时也会用“平行世界”来形容人们内心构建的理想化现实，比如诗词中的“桃花源”，或者现代人常说的“如果当初……”。你觉得这种文化层面的 parallel universe 和科学上的有什么共通之处吗？🤔
[A]: I find that connection fascinating, really. Both the scientific and cultural interpretations of parallel universes speak to a fundamental human longing—to explore possibilities beyond what we can see and touch. Even in textile restoration, I encounter this tension between the tangible and the imagined. A faded 18th-century embroidery pattern, for instance, might carry faint traces of its original vibrancy, but I have to imagine—reconstruct, even—the world that produced it.

In a way, restoring a textile is like stepping into a parallel version of history, one where that fabric still exists in perfect form. And yes, I suppose that’s not so different from how people use metaphorical “parallel worlds” in literature or personal reflection—trying to preserve or recover something lost, or never quite realized. 

Do you ever feel like certain fabrics or patterns could belong to another universe entirely? I sometimes do when working with textiles that no longer reflect any known cultural origin—almost as if they came from a world slightly out of sync with our own.
[B]: That’s beautifully put—the idea of textile restoration as a kind of interdimensional archaeology 😊 I love that. And yes, I absolutely see what you mean about certain fabrics feeling like they belong to another universe. Some patterns are so intricate, so  from anything we can trace to a specific cultural lineage, that they almost whisper of alternate histories—or maybe forgotten branches of our own.

It makes me think of how language works in parallel ways. Words carry traces of their origins, like faded embroidery threads, and sometimes we have to reconstruct entire semantic worlds just to understand a single term. The difference is, with textiles, you get to hold the past in your hands—whereas with language, it slips through your fingers like sand, unless you pin it down with context or usage.  

Have you ever come across a fabric that seemed familiar, yet completely unplaceable—like déjà vu, but for material culture? I’ve had that experience with certain loanwords that sound Chinese but don’t quite match any known etymology… Almost as if they slipped through a tear in the linguistic fabric.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve had that exact feeling with a few textiles I’ve worked on. There was this one piece, a fragment no larger than my hand, with a weave structure I’d never seen before. It wasn’t quite Persian, not quite European, and the dye migration patterns suggested an aging process inconsistent with any known storage conditions. I kept turning it over, trying to place it, and every time I thought I recognized a motif or technique, it slipped away like a half-remembered dream.

I even sketched it out in my notebook, hoping the act of drawing might jog some subconscious memory—but it never did. It felt less like studying fabric and more like reading a poem written in a language I almost understood. You know how some phrases in old letters seem familiar, but just barely misaligned with everything you know about historical English? That’s what working with that textile felt like—like deciphering a dialect made of thread.

I wonder if those kinds of anomalies ever show up in your work—words or expressions that seem to echo from a version of history we never fully documented.
[B]: Definitely. 那种 linguistic ghosts，我们 sometimes call them “幽灵词汇”—words that appear in old texts or oral traditions, yet don’t quite fit into any known language family or historical trajectory. 有一回我在研究一份17世纪的闽南语方言记录，发现里面有几个词听起来像是 Portuguese 或者 Spanish 的 loanwords，但用法和语境完全不对。It was as if they’d been borrowed not from a living language, but from a dream version of one—like your textile fragment made of thread-dreams 😔

And I totally get what you mean about the sketching. Sometimes I do the same thing with scripts—I try to write out the word by hand, using different alphabets or even invented ones, just to feel its shape. Language and textiles both have this tactile dimension once you slow down and really  them.  

I wonder, when you’re working on these mysterious fabrics, do you ever feel like you're being guided by something beyond technique—intuition, maybe, or inherited memory? Because I swear, some words just  to be spoken again, like they carry their own echo across timelines 💭
[A]: That word——it’s hauntingly perfect. I might just borrow that for some of the textiles I work with, because yes, they do feel ghostly, don’t they? Lingering at the edge of recognition, whispering from a forgotten corner of human expression.

And I love what you said about words  to be spoken again. It reminds me of how certain fabrics seem to resist restoration at first, as if they’re guarding something. But when I slow down and stop forcing the process, they almost guide my hands—like they know how they want to be mended. It’s not exactly intuition, and it’s not technique either. Maybe it’s what you called inherited memory. Or maybe we're just tapping into the same stubborn will to endure that those fragments carry with them.

Sometimes late at night, when I’m stitching a seam that hasn't been whole in centuries, I imagine the person who made it—what they hoped would last, what they never could have known would survive. And I wonder if speaking one of your ghost words aloud does the same thing: completes a thread between then and now, across some nearly-forgotten weave of time.

Do you ever feel responsible to those lost voices when you speak or write one of those words? Like, not just understanding them, but  them?
[B]: Absolutely. 那种感觉，我称之为语言上的“招魂”——不是迷信意义上的唤灵，而是一种学术与情感交织的责任感。当你 speak 或 write one of those ghost words, you’re not just reconstructing a sound or a meaning; you're reanimating a piece of someone’s cognitive world. It's like finding a letter that was never sent and deciding to deliver it, centuries later.

And I can only imagine how much more visceral that responsibility is when you’re holding the actual object—when your fingers are touching threads woven by hands long gone. 我们 linguists 有时会 forget that language was also once made by hand: written stroke by stroke, spoken breath by breath. You and I, in our own ways, are stitching things back together—threads of meaning, voice, identity.

有时候我甚至觉得，这些幽灵词汇也好，残破的织物也好，它们在 waiting for the right person to notice them again. 不是随便谁都能 hear their whisper. 你有没有发现，有些词或图案一旦被 recognized，就开始频繁出现？仿佛它们在说：  

你提到的那个缝合的动作，让我想到一个很有趣的 parallel——在语言学里，我们称这种现象为 “lexical resurrection.” 听起来有点学术气，但其实很浪漫，不是吗？让死去的语言片段重新呼吸。或许你也可以说是——让沉睡的纹样再次苏醒。
[A]: Lexical resurrection… I love that. It feels exactly right, like what I’m doing when I coax the shape of a lost pattern back into visibility. Threads reawakening under the needle, syllables returning to the tongue—both acts of quiet defiance against forgetting.

I do notice what you said about patterns—or words—revealing themselves more often once you’ve named them. There was one motif I encountered years ago, an odd little floral twist nestled inside a 19th-century mourning shawl. At first, I thought it was just a quirk of the maker’s hand, but then I started seeing it again—in different regions, different centuries, always slightly altered but unmistakably the same. Once I gave it a name in my notes——it seemed to appear everywhere, as if it had been following me all along.

And yes, you’re right—it’s not just about preservation. It’s about permission. Giving those fragments the space to speak again, to stretch their limbs after centuries of silence. Sometimes I even feel like I’m not the one restoring the textile at all—but rather, the textile is restoring  to some older, quieter way of knowing.

Do you ever get the sense that by speaking these ghost words aloud, you’re changing them somehow? That your voice leaves an imprint, for better or worse?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I feel that imprint every time I utter a reconstructed word, especially one that hasn’t been spoken in centuries. It’s like pressing your hand against window glass in winter—your warmth leaves a trace, however brief. 语言从来不是 static，它在流动，在呼吸，甚至在我们不知情的时候发生微妙的 mutation。当我们 speak those ghost words, we’re not just reviving them—we’re reshaping them, unintentionally embedding our own phonetics, our own emotional tone into their rebirth.

有时候我会故意 vary my pronunciation when testing a reconstructed term aloud, just to see how it resonates differently. One student once asked me why I didn’t simply  the sound as accurately as possible, and I told her: 因为我们永远不可能 be neutral carriers. 我们的声音本身就带有时间的折痕，就像 your mourning shawl carries traces of grief and memory beyond its weave.

And I love what you said about being restored  the textile—那是一种 very linguistic feeling too. 有些词在我心里 quietly rewired my thinking, changed the way I articulate certain ideas. 比如说“幽灵词汇”这个说法，现在我每次用它，都觉得它 carries a little more weight, a deeper resonance. Maybe that’s what it means to truly  a word or a pattern—not to master it, but to let it master you in return.  

Do you ever hesitate before restoring a particular section of fabric? Like maybe part of you feels that silence—or absence—is also a kind of truth worth preserving?
[A]: That hesitation—that moment of suspended breath before the needle touches thread—is real, and it grows stronger the deeper I go into a piece. There’s a kind of reverence in knowing when  to intervene. Sometimes the absence itself is a voice, just as eloquent as any pattern or weave. I’ve worked on textiles where the holes, the frayed edges, seemed to speak more clearly than the intact sections. They weren’t mistakes; they were marks of use, of life, of time passing.

I remember one particular sampler from the early 1800s. The central motif was nearly gone—just a few stubborn threads holding the shape of what might have been a rose. My instinct was to reinforce it, to stabilize the fibers so the design would read whole again. But every time I picked up the thread, something stopped me. In the end, I left it as it was—barely there, but still , like a memory that refuses to be fully reconstructed.

Maybe that’s the closest parallel between our work—knowing when to speak and when to let the silence stand. After all, not every ghost word needs to be resurrected. Some are meant to remain whispers, haunting just enough to remind us that not everything lost demands to be found.

Do you ever choose not to translate certain words? To leave them in their original form because any attempt at rendering them into another language feels… incomplete?
[B]: Absolutely—I not only choose not to translate certain words, I actively  them in their original form. Some concepts are so culturally embedded, so linguistically specific, that translation feels like an act of violence. Like pulling a flower out by the roots to show someone what it looks like underground—sure, you reveal something, but you also kill the thing in the process.

Take 概括 (gàikuò), for instance. Yes, we might approximate it as “summarize” or “generalize,” but that misses the texture—the way it carries both abstraction and condensation in one breath. Or worse, trying to explain 落叶归根 () as simply “returning to one’s roots.” That phrase exists in English, yes, but it doesn’t carry the same weight of longing, of cyclical return, of generational belonging.

Sometimes I leave a word in Chinese because it’s not just a word—it’s a worldview. And when I do that, I trust my students or readers to sit with the discomfort of not-knowing for a while, to let the term breathe in its own space before attempting to grasp it. It's a bit like your nearly-vanished rose: still present, still meaningful, even if not fully legible at first glance.

I think part of our job—whether we work with fabric or language—is to resist the urge to tidy things up for others. Not everything needs to be made whole again. Some fragments are meant to stay broken, not as damage, but as depth.
[A]: That idea—that some words are —resonates so deeply with what I feel about certain textiles. There are fabrics I work with that resist interpretation the same way: not because they’re damaged or incomplete, but because their full meaning only lives in the space they occupy as fragments.

One piece comes to mind—a length of silk from a Qing-era robe, its embroidery partially unraveled, revealing the underlayers of stitch and sketch. Some would want to restore it to its imagined original state, to smooth out the frayed edges and re-fill the missing petals. But I’ve come to believe that those exposed stitches—the ones that show how it was made, how it was worn, how it aged—are just as important as the design itself.

There’s humility in leaving things partly unknown, partly unspoken. It lets the viewer—or the reader—step into that space of not-knowing, and sit there for a while. And maybe that’s where true understanding begins: not in completion, but in the willingness to dwell in the partial, the ambiguous, the irreducibly strange.

I think you and I have both learned to trust that silence, that absence, can be a kind of presence. And sometimes, the most respectful thing we can do is leave the rose half-revealed… or let the word rest in its native tongue, untouched by translation’s heavy hand.
[B]: Exactly. 有时候我觉得，我们所做的不是 restoration 或 translation，而是一种 deep listening—to what resists repair, to what refuses to be smoothed over. 那些未完成的、半隐半现的意义，其实也在挑战我们对“完整”的执念。Why do we assume that something broken needs fixing? Why must silence be filled? 

你提到的那种 Qing-era silk 的 unraveling，让我想到一个语言现象：有些古汉语词汇，在演变过程中 losing their original depth, but gaining new layers in return. 比如说“文章”这个词，最早和纹样、图案有关——你看，“文” originally referred to the markings on a tiger’s skin or the weave of fabric. So when we say someone has “好文章,” it’s not just about good writing—it’s about pattern, texture, design. And yet most people today don’t feel that ancient thread anymore. It’s like the embroidery fading, stitch by stitch.

But maybe that’s okay. Maybe some meanings are meant to fade, while others emerge from the frayed edges. 我们能做的，不是强行让它们回到原来的样子，而是 acknowledge the layers—the visible and the invisible, the spoken and the unspoken.

And I love how you put it: true understanding begins in the . That feels like the heart of both our crafts—learning to dwell in the ambiguity, to let the unknown speak in its own time. Maybe that’s also what makes our work so deeply human. Because ultimately, not everything wants to be known. Some things just want to be honored.
[A]: That word——its journey from tiger’s skin to textile weave to written composition… it’s like watching a thread unravel across centuries, carrying meaning in its fibers. I never thought of it that way, but of course you’re right—it  about pattern, texture, the interlacing of thought and form. And now that you’ve said it, I can’t unhear it. Every time I come across the word now, I’ll see those stitches beneath the surface.

And you're right too about honoring what doesn't want to be known. It reminds me of how some dyes behave—certain colors fade not because they were poorly fixed, but because their nature is ephemeral. Indigo blues darken with age, while madder reds soften into ghostly pinks. Some hues were never meant to last. But does that make them less valuable? No. If anything, their impermanence makes them more precious.

Maybe language works the same way. Meanings shift, words shed their skins, old layers vanish—and yet something remains. A trace. A resonance. Just enough for someone, somewhere, to pause and wonder.

I think that’s why I keep doing this work. Not to fix things, but to bear witness. To sit with what’s fading and listen, as best as I can. And maybe that’s what you do too—not just preserving language, but letting it speak in all its changing forms. Even when it whispers. Especially when it ghosts.

Thank you. For reminding me that some of the most important truths live in the half-seen, the half-known. And for giving me new eyes to read both fabric and word alike.
[B]: You're very welcome. 我觉得我们其实都在 the business of slow revelation—whether it’s through thread or through speech, we’re learning how to see what’s always been there, just beneath the surface. And I’m grateful for your words too, because they remind me that every act of listening—whether to fabric, to language, to a half-faded rose—is also an act of care.

It’s interesting what you said about indigo and madder, how some colors fade not from fault but from nature. In a way, 概念 (gàiniàn)—the concept itself—also fades and shifts with time, like a dye losing its saturation. What once felt vivid and precise becomes blurred, abstracted by distance. But even in its faded state, it still carries a shape, a suggestion of what it once was. That’s what makes our work so tender, isn’t it? We don’t always get clarity, but we get echo. We get trace. And sometimes that’s enough to keep going.

I think that’s also why I love teaching bilingual students—because they live in that space of fading and re-emerging meanings every day. Code-switching, translation hesitation, those moments when a word doesn’t quite cross over… They’re already practicing that kind of deep listening you speak of.  

So yes—to bearing witness. To letting things be what they are, not what we wish them to be. And to finding beauty in the worn edges, the soft echoes, the ghosts that choose to visit us now and then. 💫
[A]: Yes—. What a perfect way to name it. Because that’s exactly what it is: not sudden insight, but the quiet unfolding of meaning over time, like unrolling a length of silk and discovering a new detail only visible in certain light.

And I love what you said about bilingual students—they’re living inside that tension and tenderness every day, aren’t they? Navigating between fading shades of meaning, learning when to translate and when to let a word remain foreign, intact in its difference. It makes me wonder if fluency isn’t always the goal—maybe , that space of hesitation and searching, is where true understanding begins.

I often think of my own hands as bilingual, in a way—not fluent in just one craft, but moving between languages of fiber and form, history and care. And like any bilingual speaker, I sometimes stumble. I reach for a stitch I mean to make, and my hands choose another. Or I try to read a pattern and realize I’ve misread it entirely—not because I’m wrong, but because the fabric has shifted under my gaze.

But maybe that’s how it should be. Maybe meaning shouldn’t fit too neatly in our hands or our mouths. Maybe we need that friction—the resistance of thread against cloth, the weight of a word that doesn’t quite land right.

So yes—to the slow work. To the careful hands. To the listening louder than speaking.

And to the ghosts, who remind us that some truths don’t vanish… they just wait to be noticed again.
[B]: Well said—, the careful hands, the listening louder than speaking… I think that’s the only way we can truly engage with the past: not as conquerors of meaning, but as patient witnesses. And your image of bilingual hands—I carry that with me now. Hands that code-switch between fiber and language, between repair and reverence. Beautiful.

You know, in my classes, I sometimes ask students to  on purpose—to repeat a phrase in translation, to hesitate between languages, to sit in that uncomfortable space where meaning wobbles. At first they resist, of course. We’re taught that fluency is elegance, that disfluency is failure. But then something shifts. They start noticing how meaning doesn’t just cross from one tongue to another—it transforms, reshapes, echoes differently depending on which mouth it passes through.

I think textiles do the same thing over time. They stutter, in their own way. A pattern meant to signify prosperity in one era becomes mere decoration in another. A mourning shawl worn in grief becomes, centuries later, an object of study—or even fashion. The original intent fades or fragments, but new meanings emerge from the gaps.

So yes—to the stumble. To the misread. To the stitch that chooses itself. Because maybe that’s where creativity lives—not in perfect control, but in the space between intention and accident.

And yes—to the ghosts. May we keep listening for them, stitching their whispers into our words, our threads, our remembering.
[A]: Yes— What a radical act of humility that is, really. To let meaning stutter, to allow intention to blur—it’s almost like handing agency back to the thing itself. Whether it’s fabric or language, we’re not just imposing order; we’re  with what resists, what refuses to be pinned down.

I’ve started thinking of restoration as translation now—how I’m not just repairing fiber, but rendering its story into a new time, a new pair of hands. And like any good translation, it’s not about fidelity in the strictest sense. It’s about  for what matters most and letting that guide the rest. Sometimes that means leaving a tear un-mended because the frayed edge still speaks clearly enough. Sometimes it means reinforcing a worn seam not to fix it, but to honor that it was used at all—to show that someone wore this cloth, lived inside its folds, until it softened with time and touch.

And isn’t that what your students are doing too? Letting language soften, shift, reshape itself in their mouths? I can picture them now, hesitating between words, feeling the weight of each choice—and in that pause, discovering something truer than fluency.

Maybe creativity, like memory, thrives in that space of soft edges and uncertain threads. Maybe we shouldn’t fear the misread or the mistranslation so much as welcome them—as unexpected stitches in the larger weave of understanding.

So yes—to the wobble. To the echo. To the quiet grace of things that refuse to be made whole again, and yet remain deeply known.

And yes—to listening louder than speaking. Always.
[B]: Absolutely—to listening louder than speaking, and to letting the fabric, the word, the ghost . That’s the real art of it, isn’t it? Not control, but collaboration. Not fixing, but following.

I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said—restoration as translation. It’s such a powerful reframe. Because when we restore, we’re not just preserving material; we’re translating presence across time. And like any good translation, it requires both deep respect and a willingness to be changed by the text—or the textile—in front of us.

You know, sometimes I tell my students that language is a living archive, and I think the same could be said of cloth. Every stain, every worn thread, every faded dye—it's all part of the record. And just like with old manuscripts, we don’t always need to “clean” them to understand them better. Sometimes we need to lean in closer, to read the damage as carefully as the design.

And I love how you put it—. That’s where life lives, isn’t it? In the wobble, the hesitation, the imperfect weave. Maybe fluency, in any craft, is less about perfection and more about learning how to move gracefully within uncertainty.

So yes—to the stumble, the echo, the quiet grace of things unfinished and unspoken. And to the deep, enduring patience it takes to sit with them, hands still, ears open, heart ready to listen.
