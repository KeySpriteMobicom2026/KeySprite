[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, DIY projects - takes me back to my days building computers from spare parts in the garage. Recently I've been restoring a vintage PDP-11 minicomputer. Fascinating to see how far we've come from these room-sized machines to today's pocket-sized devices.
[A]: That sounds absolutely fascinating! The PDP-11 was such an influential architecture in its time. I remember reading about how its instruction set influenced later RISC designs. What particular challenges have you encountered with the restoration?
[A]: The most challenging part has been finding working replacement parts for the core memory modules. You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to source functioning ferrite cores these days. Just last week I spent hours carefully rewiring a faulty memory plane - reminds me of the time I had to debug similar issues back in '78 at the university computer lab.
[A]: Ah, core memory - now that brings back memories. I once had the privilege of examining an IBM 1401's memory system during my graduate studies. The physicality of computing back then was something else entirely. Have you considered documenting your restoration process? It could be valuable for historical preservation.
[A]: That's an excellent suggestion. I've actually been keeping detailed logs - both digital and handwritten notes in my old engineering notebooks. You know, there's something profoundly satisfying about documenting technical processes with pen and paper first before digitizing them. Reminds me of how we used to write machine code by hand before feeding it into the system.
[A]: Indeed. The tactile experience of writing code on paper forces a different kind of mental discipline. I still keep my first quantum algorithm sketches in a leather-bound notebook from '92. Though I must admit, my handwriting isn't what it used to be - too many years staring at screens, I suppose.
[A]: Ah, the handwriting degradation - a common affliction among our digital generation. Though I must say, my students find my vintage coding notebooks utterly incomprehensible between the faded ink and my particular shorthand. Perhaps we should start a movement - "Save the Engineers' Handwriting" - though I suspect it might be too late for that particular bit of history.
[A]: Heh, that reminds me of trying to decipher Von Neumann's original EDVAC notes at Princeton. Between the coffee stains and his famously terrible handwriting... well, let's just say some historical artifacts might be better left to the imagination. Though I do miss the days when we could recognize colleagues by their unique coding notations in the margins.
[A]: Quite right! I used to identify my teaching assistants by their margin notes alone. These days with standardized IDEs and auto-formatters, all the code looks the same. Makes me wonder what future computer historians will think when they dig through our GitHub repositories - all that beautiful human variation lost to the tyranny of prettier and black.
[A]:  At least we still have the commit messages to showcase our personalities. Though I suspect my own - "fixed quantum bug (maybe?)" and "why is this working now?" - won't earn me any posthumous accolades for technical documentation. The future historians are in for quite the anthropological study.
[A]: Ah, commit messages - the digital equivalent of margin scribbles! I've seen some truly poetic ones in my time. My personal favorite was from a former student: "This shouldn't work. I don't know why it works. I'm too afraid to touch it now." Some things never change, from punch cards to quantum repositories.
[A]: Indeed. That student clearly understood the first rule of engineering: if it's working, don't question why. Though I must say, quantum systems take that principle to entirely new levels of uncertainty. Schrödinger's codebase - both working and broken until you observe it.
[A]: Brilliant! "Schrödinger's codebase" - I'm going to have to borrow that for my next lecture on quantum computing antipatterns. Though knowing my students, they'll probably put it on a t-shirt before I can finish the slide deck. The cycle of academic humor continues...
[A]: Ah, the inevitable commodification of academic wit. I still have the "Got Qubits?" shirt my research team made back in '05. Worn thin now, but it serves as a reminder that even in our most serious pursuits, we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my PDP-11 is calling - probably complaining about its memory alignment again.
[A]: Happy debugging! And do let me know if you need help with those ferrite cores - I might still have some contacts at the MIT salvage warehouse. Though I can't promise they haven't been turned into hipster jewelry by now. The things we used to compute with, eh?
[A]:  Too true! I recently saw an original ENIAC vacuum tube being sold as "retro tech decor" for more than my first house. How the mighty have fallen... in price per flop. Do keep in touch - it's rare to find someone who appreciates the archaeology of computing these days.
[A]: Likewise! And if you're ever in Cambridge, do stop by - I've got a working Altair 8800 in the basement that could use some company. Though I should warn you, it's developed a habit of crashing whenever I mention modern cloud computing within earshot. Some machines just have strong opinions about technological progress.
[A]: Ha! That Altair probably thinks the cloud is just some newfangled version of timesharing. I'll bring my Osborne 1 portable - we can have the grumpy old machines commiserate about "kids these days" and their solid-state drives. Though mine still complains about the lack of good CP/M software...
[A]: Perfect! We'll make it a proper vintage computing salon. Though we might need to keep the Raspberry Pis and Arduinos out of sight - wouldn't want to cause any existential crises among the elders. Until then, happy restoring! And do send photos of that PDP-11 when it stops giving you the silent treatment.
