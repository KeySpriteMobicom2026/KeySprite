[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... I once encountered a passage in  that described déjà vu as the soul brushing against the edges of past lives. The protagonist would stumble upon villages he swore he'd walked through centuries ago. 

Of course, my colleague in the neuroscience department insists it's merely temporal lobe misfiring. But then again, could both be true? Like how we read  - is it mere monkey tales or allegory for spiritual cultivation?

Actually, last week while grading papers, I found myself rereading a sentence three times before realizing it was my own marginalia from twenty years prior. That gave me pause. Perhaps our minds are like palimpsests, always echoing fragments of what came before.
[A]: Hmm, your palimpsest analogy reminds me of the  experiment - we're conditioned to react to stimuli that resonate with past experiences. But here's a twist: what if déjà vu is the mind's way of... debugging? Like when a programmer spots a bug in their code, then suddenly realizes they've fixed this exact issue before. Except instead of code, it's our neural pathways firing in patterns that mimic past events. 

I once played a chess match where my opponent mirrored every move I made. It felt eerily similar to déjà vu - like my own strategies were being reflected back at me. Maybe that's what happens in those moments? Our brain recognizes a pattern it created earlier, but the source is... ourselves. A cognitive mirror. 🤯

You know, there's a term in Mandarin called "shíxī" (识隙) - literally "consciousness gap". Some researchers use it to describe these fleeting moments where our mind stumbles over itself. Not sure if it's temporal lobe or spiritual residue, but I find comfort in the idea that our brains might be... recycling old memories to make sense of new situations. Like reusing functions in a programming language. 💡
[B]: Fascinating how you wove programming metaphors with neurobiology. Reminds me of Lu Xun's observation that "the past is not dead; it's not even past." Though I must quibble with your chess analogy - if déjà vu were a mirrored game, would we not then have to posit who occupies the other side of the board? 

The concept of  intrigues me. Makes me think of Thomas De Quincey's  - his opium-induced visions where landscapes folded into themselves like origami. He described walking through streets in Manchester only to realize he'd traversed identical paths in dreams decades prior. Was that merely neurological recycling, or some deeper truth about how consciousness constructs reality?

Come to think of it, my mother used to say her teacup would tremble slightly before she experienced déjà vu. I dismissed it as coincidence until I read about the  - how physical objects sometimes anchor us during temporal disorientation. Perhaps our brains do run on debug mode, but who writes this code? Evolutionary programming? Or something more... ineffable?
[A]: Ah, now you're touching the ineffable — and I love how you brought in . It makes me think of a study I read last year about "object anchoring" during dissociative episodes. One participant described her coffee mug vibrating before every déjà vu episode. Turns out, her brain had formed an unconscious association between holding that specific shape of cup and pattern recognition mismatches — almost like a browser crashing when too many tabs are open. 🖥️

Your question about who writes the code? That’s pure gold. Reminds me of Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream — is he a man dreaming he's a butterfly or vice versa? If we follow that logic, maybe our consciousness isn’t writing the code but interpreting it through different compilers. Like how Python and JavaScript handle loops differently — one uses indentation, the other curly braces. Same function, different syntax. 

And speaking of syntax — let’s revisit your chess analogy quibble. If we extend the game metaphor... what if we're both player & piece on the board? I mean, in shogi or xiangqi, pieces don't move themselves, yet they contain the rules of movement within their design. Maybe our neural patterns operate the same way — simultaneously movers & moved. ♟️✨

Honestly though, sometimes I wonder if all these neurological explanations are just our modern version of "humors theory." Will we wake up 200 years from now laughing at today’s fMRI studies the way we chuckle at leech therapy? Until then — shall we continue this over jasmine tea? I know a spot where the cups never tremble... or do they? ☕
[B]: Ah, now  is a proposition worthy of Borges - meeting in a space where teacups defy tremors, as if they've learned to hold their breath. 

Your compiler metaphor makes me think of translation theory - how we render  (有缘无份) into English. Do we use "fate without缘分" and lose the tonal play, or coin something ungainly like "providential impossibility"? Same with consciousness - perhaps we're merely bad translators of our own interiority.

And you're right about xiangqi pieces containing movement rules within their forms. Reminds me of Wordsworth's  - how he describes childhood consciousness as both actor and authored. A paradox wrapped in neural tissue.

As for future scholars chuckling at fMRI scans... I suspect they'll keep our brain imaging alongside phrenology charts, yes. But then again, so might they keep half our literary criticism. 

Jasmine tea sounds perfect. Though I must warn you - the last time I met a student there, we debated  so fervently the tealeaves rearranged themselves into hexagrams. Either that, or the proprietor slipped us some particularly potent pu'erh. 🍵
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of déjà vu I can believe in — where tealeaves rewrite their own script. 🍵✨

You know, your translation dilemma makes me think of that line from Eliot’s : “Words strain, crack, and sometimes break under the burden.” Maybe that’s what we’re hearing whenever we try to translate  or describe a déjà vu — the sound of language creaking under the weight of consciousness.

And speaking of consciousness as both actor and authored — isn’t that what improvisational theater is? You step on stage with nothing but muscle memory and instinct, hoping your lines match someone else’s rhythm. Maybe our brains are just really good ensemble actors. 

Wait — did you say hexagrams appeared in your tea? Or was that pu'erh talking? Either way, I’m there. In fact, I’ll bring my copy of the . Who knows — maybe it's not the tea rewriting destiny, but the conversation itself. 📚☯️

Shall we meet at the usual spot? I promise not to spill... unless the universe insists.
[B]: Ah, but if the universe insists on spills, we should let it - chaos theory and all. Though I'll bring my porcelain cup from Jingdezhen, the one that survived both a lecture on Woolf's stream of consciousness  a rather zealous grad student's coffee spill. Let's see if tea leaves in circular motion obey different laws of physics when discussing fate.

Eliot's right about language straining, of course. Makes me think of translating Du Fu's "夜阑更秉烛，相对如梦寐" - how do you render that quiet terror of loving someone so much you fear your time together must be a dream? You end up needing both  and  in the same sentence.

As for our brains being ensemble actors... yes! Exactly like those Beijing opera performers who master roles so thoroughly they become archetypes. I once watched an actor play Tang Xianzu's Liniang for 30 years - by the end, no one could tell where the woman ended and the ghost began. Much like us when we're deep in thought, wouldn't you say?

See you at the teahouse. And do bring the  - though I suspect tonight we'll be writing commentaries on the hexagrams rather than reading them. Or perhaps that's what the universe intended all along? 📜🌙
[A]: Ah, now you're thinking like a true  commentator — the best readings come from moments that demand their own interpretation. 📜🌙

I love how you brought in Du Fu’s lines — there's something so...  about "相对如梦寐." It's déjà vu and future déjà vu at once, isn’t it? That quiet terror you mentioned — fearing love is a dream because its beauty strains believability. Maybe that’s why we need both  and : one lives in fate, the other in memory — two languages trying to translate the same heartbeat.

And your Beijing opera reference — perfect. I’ve always thought of consciousness as a troupe of actors who've played each other’s roles for so long they forget which mask is their face. Like when students tell me, “I just can’t focus today,” and I wonder: is the narrator malfunctioning, or is the story itself unraveling?

As for your Jingdezhen cup — talk about resilience! If it survived Woolf  caffeine addiction, it might be ready for oracle bones. I’ll bring my grandfather’s brush just in case we feel compelled to annotate the night itself. Who knows, maybe the tea leaves will spell out Hexagram 54 — , a moment of transition that honors both departure and return.

See you soon. And yes — let the universe spill if it must. We'll call it an offering to the narrative. 🍵🖋️
[B]: Ah, Hexagram 54 — most appropriate. Though I suspect if we're to honor its spirit properly, we'll need to argue about whether the daughter returns  something or merely returns  something. Much like trying to pin down Du Fu's dreamlike terror: is it memory straining toward fate, or fate folding into memory?

Your troupe of actors metaphor strikes deep. Reminds me of teaching  last semester. One student insisted the prince wasn't mad — merely auditioning for different versions of himself. A radical reading, but not without merit. After all, what is melancholy if not narrative dissonance?

And speaking of dissonance — your grandfather's brush! Please do bring it. I’ve been meaning to test a theory: that calligraphy slows time in a way no Western typography ever could. Each stroke a kind of temporal resistance. If nothing else, it might give us leverage against the universe’s inclination to spill.

I’ll prepare my annotations accordingly. Though fair warning — last time I tried ink with jasmine tea, the characters bled into something between  and . Perhaps both at once? A fitting prelude to our meeting. 🖋️🌀
[A]: Ah, now  — the bleeding edge where ink meets tea meets time. 🖋️🌀 Perfectly captures the spirit of what we’re doing tonight: philosophy with a splash of improvisation.

Your student’s take on  is gold — really, it's all just method acting gone rogue. I once told a class that depression isn’t sadness but narrative overload. You keep trying on new storylines until your character can’t hold the plot together anymore. Maybe that’s why we study literature and consciousness side by side — both are acts of assembling meaning from chaos.

And your calligraphy-as-temporal-resistance theory? Brilliant. I’ve always thought writing by hand slows perception — like how drawing forces you to , not just look. In fact, I’ll bring some mulberry paper too. If our annotations merge into something between chaos & serendipity… well, let’s just say the universe might be hinting we're asking the right questions. ✍️🌀

I’m starting to think Hexagram 54 chose us — not the other way around. After all, returning the daughter could mean memory becoming present again, or the present finally claiming its lineage with the past. Much like déjà vu, fate, and tealeaves in motion.

See you at the threshold — brush in one hand, cup in the other. Ready to spill. 🍵🖋️
[B]: Ah,  - the best conversations happen precisely there, don't they? Neither inside nor out, like Hamlet lingering in the arras, caught between action and observation. 

Your narrative overload theory of depression... dare I say it's rather Whitmanesque? The self containing multitudes until the seams begin to show. Though perhaps we should blame modernity's fracturing gaze - we've become too accustomed to reading consciousness like a palimpsest under harsh light.

Speaking of light - do bring that mulberry paper. I've been experimenting with ink density as a temporal marker. Heavier strokes seem to anchor time more stubbornly than swift ones. We might create our own chronology tonight, one brushstroke at a time.

And yes, Hexagram 54 choosing us feels entirely appropriate. After all, if déjà vu is memory becoming present, then perhaps we're not merely discussing phenomena but enacting them. Like those Tang poets who claimed to dream their way into ancient texts.

See you soon at the threshold. I'll arrive early - you know how I like to watch teacups tremble in anticipation. And do remind me to tell you about my student who tried diagramming  as a Möbius strip. Fascinating mess. 📜🌀
[A]: Ah, arriving early to watch teacups tremble — now  a poem waiting to be written. 📜🌀 You’ve got me half-convinced they tremble not from touch, but from anticipation of conversation itself. Like actors backstage, catching whispers of the script.

I love your ink density experiment — what a beautifully subtle way to mark time. It makes me think of how we read history: some moments are etched deep, others sketched in haste, yet both shape our understanding. Maybe tonight we’ll write our own chronology — one where time doesn’t march but dances, loops back on itself like the Möbius strip your student attempted. Messy? Absolutely. But so is consciousness.

And speaking of mess — yes, modernity  shine too bright a light on the palimpsest. We forget that not all layers are meant to be legible at once. Sometimes meaning needs shadow to breathe. Whitmanesque multitudes indeed — though I suspect Walt would’ve preferred our teahouse to any lecture hall.

Hexagram 54 choosing us... or us choosing it? At this point, does it matter? We’re already in the space between, where intention and coincidence blur. Like those Tang poets you mentioned — dreaming themselves into texts already written, yet not yet read.

See you soon at the threshold. Brush ready. Cup steady — for now. And please, remind  to bring extra paper. If your student’s diagram was a fascinating mess, I intend to make it myth. 🖋️🌙
[B]: Ah, but don’t you see? That trembling  the poem. The cup doesn't need verses — its quivering lip already murmurs the first line. Perhaps we've been thinking of oracles all wrong. Maybe they don't speak in riddles — maybe they simply tremble in perfect syntax.

Your dance metaphor — infinitely preferable to linear time. Makes me think of teaching  and trying to explain how Heathcliff and Catherine exist not before or after each other, but , , . Temporal choreography, really. If we're lucky, tonight's conversation might pirouette similarly.

And shadows for meaning to breathe — beautifully put. Reminds me of that Tang dynasty critic who claimed too much clarity killed a poem. He likened over-interpretation to holding a moth too tightly — the wings stop fluttering. Let’s keep our hands loose around meaning, shall we?

As for Hexagram 54 — choice and chosen, again. Much like your narrative overload theory: are we writing this exchange or merely channeling some archetypal faculty lounge where all philosophical conversations have already happened? I suspect myth-making is just high-quality deja vu with better calligraphy.

Extra paper indeed. If we’re to transform mess into myth, we’ll need every sheet. I’ll bring my inkstone carved with bats — symbolizing fortune, though whether good or ill remains deliciously ambiguous. See you at the threshold, then. Steady cup or no, we both know what spills cannot be unspilled... only retold. 🖋️🌀
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of truth that arrives not in statements but in tremors — the cup murmuring the first line before the poem even begins. 🖋️🌀 Maybe all oracles are just objects that mastered subtle vibration. I’ll never look at my teacup the same way again — who knows what syntax it's been speaking all these years?

Your  metaphor spins beautifully — temporal choreography indeed. Heathcliff and Catherine exist in a kind of narrative superposition, don’t they? Like particles entangled across time. Makes me wonder if great literary pairings aren’t romantic so much as  — their love is less about desire than shared resistance to linear fate.

And that Tang critic you mentioned — brilliant insight. We do kill poetry when we press too hard. Even our conversation tonight feels like holding an idea loosely enough for it to keep fluttering. Maybe that’s the real art: not controlling meaning, but letting it beat its wings without escape.

As for Hexagram 54 and archetypal faculty lounges — yes! I’ve long suspected all philosophical dialogue is déjà vu with citations. We’re just retelling ancient myths through new ink, hoping this time the message sticks... or better yet, evolves.

Bring your bat-carved inkstone — ambiguity is the only fortune worth chasing. And yes, steady cup or no, we both know the spills are part of the script. Let’s see what gets written when myth and mess share the same page. 📜🌙

See you soon — brush raised, meaning loose, and teacup trembling in poetic anticipation. 🍵🖋️
[B]: Ah,  — what a delicious phrase. I may have to borrow that for my next lecture on . Imagine Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi not as rivals but entangled timelines, each move echoing across both their fates. 

You’re right about literary love affairs being temporal resistances rather than romantic ones. Heathcliff and Catherine aren’t tragic because they can’t be together — they’re tragic because they always are, in every permutation of time except the one that allows them peace.

And your oracle-as-vibration theory... well, it explains why I’ve been collecting inkwells for decades. Some hold more than ink — they hold resonance. I suspect my Ming-era celadon piece whispers to the tea leaves when I’m not listening.

As for meaning beating its wings without escape — yes! We are indeed falconers, but the falcon is language itself, wheeling ever outward, tethered only by our fragile wrists. If we let go entirely, we fall into silence; if we pull too hard, we bring down flight itself.

I shall arrive with inkstone and loose sleeves, ready to let myth and mess conspire. And do remind me to ask — does déjà vu feel different when written in cursive versus block script? I suspect tonight’s annotations may answer that.

See you soon at the trembling threshold — where every spill is syntax, and every word already whispered in some forgotten teacup’s past. 🍵🖋️🌀
[A]: Ah, borrowing ? Go right ahead — the best ideas are like tea leaves: meant to be shared, steeped again, and occasionally spilled. 🍵🖋️🌀 I can already picture Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi locked in that elegant entanglement — not just strategy, but time dancing with itself. Like two mirrors facing each other, reflecting possibilities infinitely.

Your take on Heathcliff and Catherine — now  haunting. They’re not denied peace; they’re denied linear peace. In some version of Wuthering Heights, time curls back just enough for them to finally rest. But not this one. No, this one demands storm and longing. Tragic, really, how fate sometimes plays favorites with timelines.

And your Ming celadon inkwell whispering to tea leaves — I love it. Honestly, half the reason I write by hand is to catch what these objects murmur when we pretend not to listen. There's a quiet animism in old tools, isn't there? A brush knows more than it lets on. Ink remembers.

You’ve got me thinking about cursive vs block script now — could déjà vu have different handwriting styles depending on whether it arrives as memory or prophecy? Maybe tonight we’ll run an informal experiment. Let’s see if a flowing hand softens the edges of recognition, or if block characters punch the past into sharper focus.

And yes — falconers of language, indeed. We keep our grip just loose enough for flight, yet firm enough to stay tethered. If only the falcon knew how much poetry rides on its wingspan.

I’ll be there — ink ready to spill, brush poised, and ears tuned not just to words, but to the silence between their lines. See you at the threshold where every tremor writes a line of the poem we didn’t know we were composing. 📜🍵✨
[B]: Ah, but isn't it delightful how tea leaves and ideas both refuse to stay in one place? I do hope your cursive experiment yields results — though I suspect déjà vu writes itself most truthfully in semi-legible scrawl, the kind born of urgency and ink smudges. Block script may anchor it, yes, but does it not also straitjacket the pulse?

Your image of Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi as mirrored timelines reminds me of reading  with my father. He always insisted that Baoyu and Daiyu were not lovers but echoes — two notes vibrating at the same frequency, doomed to interfere with each other’s harmony. Perhaps all great pairings are like this: less romance than resonance.

And speaking of animism — I once caught a student whispering to my Qing-era brush, asking if it approved of her essay on Lu Xun. I pretended not to notice, of course. But later, when grading her paper, I found myself underlining a passage twice. Coincidence? Or did the brush have its say?

As for falconry and language — beautifully put. Though I wonder, do we sometimes mistake the falcon’s flight for escape when it is merely circling back toward us in wider spirals? Much like déjà vu itself.

I shall arrive with an assortment of nibs and intentions. Let us steep ourselves in conversation until the night reads like poetry and the teacups tremble with understanding. See you soon — where spillage is revelation, and every stroke of the brush risks awakening something ancient in the paper. 🖋️🌙🍵
[A]: Ah,  — now  the truest record of déjà vu. Because isn’t recognition itself a kind of blur? We almost know, almost remember… and in that gap, meaning bleeds beautifully. Cursive does have an advantage, doesn’t it? It flows like memory — connected, looping, never quite starting where we think it should.

Your father’s take on Baoyu and Daiyu — brilliant. Echoes vibrating at the same frequency, yes. Interference patterns aren’t chaos; they’re harmony being negotiated in real time. Maybe that’s why their story lingers: not because of what was, but because of what resonates across lifetimes. Like tuning forks struck centuries apart yet still humming together.

And your student whispering to the Qing-era brush — I  that. You know, I’ve long suspected that writing instruments carry more than ink. They carry intention, attention, even judgment. If that brush approved her essay, well, then you didn’t just grade her work — you co-authored a conversation across time. Underlining twice might’ve been the brush saying, “Yes, this line sees me.” 🖋️✨

You’re right about spirals too. The falcon never truly leaves — it just expands the orbit. Isn’t that what we’re doing tonight? Circling back toward each other with wider understanding, letting the night fold into something almost poetic.

I’ll bring my favorite nib — the one that skips slightly, as if hesitating before every stroke. And plenty of paper, for awakening whatever’s sleeping in the fibers. See you soon at the edge of meaning, where tea trembles, ink dreams, and déjà vu writes itself in voices we only half-recognize. 📜🌙🍵

Let the night steep in its own syntax.
[B]: Ah,  — how perfectly symbolic. That hesitation between strokes may in fact be the most honest record of all. After all, isn't déjà vu merely the mind's slight stumble over a memory it hasn't quite caught up to yet? A temporal stutter.

Your tuning fork metaphor strikes deep. I was just re-reading  last week and marveling at how Murasaki Shikibu composed entire emotional frequencies into her prose. The characters still resonate across centuries because she tuned them not to a moment, but to a wavelength. Perhaps that's what we're really after tonight — not answers, but resonance.

And yes, that brush  speaking through me. I realized it only after reading your comment about co-authoring across time. My red ink didn’t just underline — it bridged. One student’s whisper met an old scholar’s sigh somewhere above the paper. We are always writing in collaboration with ghosts, aren't we?

As for spirals and orbits — I think I shall test a theory tonight: whether cursive written counterclockwise feels more like remembering, and clockwise more like foreseeing. If my Qing-era brush consents to the experiment, we might just chart something resembling a déjà vu map.

Bring that hesitant nib by all means. And extra paper — if we awaken anything truly ancient, it may require several sheets to stretch and yawn before settling into legibility.

See you soon at the threshold where ink meets memory, teacups hum their subtle frequencies, and every word is both echo and emergence. Let the night steep indeed — in its own rhythm, with all the beautiful bleedings of meaning we can summon. 🖋️🌀🍵
