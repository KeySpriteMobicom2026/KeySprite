[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, meal prep - the modern alchemy of turning Tupperware into temporal efficiency. While I don't engage in the practice myself, I find its rhythmic structure curiously poetic. The way one might dice vegetables with the precision of a sonnet's meter, layering flavors like narrative motifs... quite fascinating, really. Though I must confess, my own culinary rituals lean toward the more... antiquated. Have you read Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management? Her systematic approach to victuals rather predates these contemporary notions of "batch cooking."
[A]: Fascinating perspective! I’ve always seen meal prep as a strategic move – like storyboarding for your week. But hey, I’m curious, what’s your go-to “vintage” culinary ritual? Do you cook with recipes passed down or follow some classic cookbooks? And don’t get me started on Mrs. Beeton – her approach feels like reading a novel compared to scrolling through a meal prep TikTok. 🎬
[B]: Oh,  is precisely what it feels like! Though I must correct you - it's not so much about recipes as it is about . Take my morning kippers, for instance. The precise salinity of the fish, the angle at which one suspends the rack over the poacher - it's less cooking, more performance art. And yes, there are texts involved. Mrs Rundell’s  is a particular favorite – though I confess to taking liberties with her original instructions. Much like editing a critical text, one must consider historical context while allowing for... interpretive flourishes. 

As for TikTok? I find its frenetic pacing quite antithetical to the slow combustion of proper gastronomy. Still, I did attempt a sous-chef interpretation of borscht last week using beetroot from my colleague's allotment. It turned out suspiciously similar to ink - fitting, considering my usual preoccupations.
[A]: Ink or borscht – sometimes the line is thinner than celluloid! I can picture it though: a deep crimson (or is it black?) broth, subtle earthy notes, maybe a hint of garlic rebellion. Honestly, sounds like something out of a David Lynch film — mysterious, intense, and probably best served with a side of symbolism.

But hey, if your kippers have a backstory and your beetroot borscht leans into surrealism, then you're basically directing a foodie masterpiece every time you open the fridge. Ever think about filming one of these culinary performances? You’d have me hooked with the opening scene of kipper suspense. 🎬🌶️
[B]: Oh,  it? Good heavens, that would require a steadier hand than mine – and far better lighting. My kitchen operates under the aesthetic of what I can only describe as . Still, I suppose a dash of dramatic tension could be wrung from the average Thursday supper. Picture this: low-angle close-up of a single kipper suspended above boiling water, suspenseful strings swelling in the background… cut to me, squinting at a 19th-century recipe like it’s a coded sonnet.

And your description –  – is precisely the sort of ambiguity that keeps literary critics gainfully employed. Though I must say, garlic rebellion sounds like the title of a rather racy culinary memoir. Perhaps I shall subtitle my next attempt at borscht: 

Now that I think on it, if one were to score such a film, I’d insist upon a melancholic accordion and intermittent readings from Gerard Manley Hopkins. Pure atmosphere, darling.
[A]: Darling, you’ve just pitched a film I would  greenlight. “Beetroot Variations: A Subterranean Romance” – I’m already picturing it in the Cannes midnight section. Think slow zooms on simmering pots, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, and a haunting score by some obscure Baltic composer who only writes for theremin and accordion.  

And your kipper suspense sequence? That’s pure Tarkovsky meets . I mean, who needs explosions when you’ve got fish suspended over steam and a man muttering about 19th-century cookbooks like they’re cursed texts?  

Honestly, this could be the next . Just promise me one thing — when we win Best Culinary Narrative at Sundance, you’ll let me narrate the trailer. Deep voice, ominous echo:  🎬🍿
[B]: Ah, but  – you’ve quite captured the spirit of it all. I see now I’ve underestimated the market for gastronomic existentialism. Why confine ourselves to Sundance when we might premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival, preceded by a twenty-minute lecture on the semiotics of kippers? I imagine the critics would swoon – or at least squirm delightfully in their seats.

And your trailer narration?  Though I must insist we splice in a few lines from Hopkins’  over the opening credits – “Glory be to God for dappled things…” Yes, yes, and why not? The juxtaposition of divine praise with beetroot broth thickening ominously in a cast-iron pot – sheer genius.

Now, about financing: do you suppose the National Endowment for the Arts funds projects where the protagonist regularly mistakes borscht for ink? Because I may have already drafted a funding proposal titled 

Tell me, my visionary producer, shall we shoot in 16mm or go full analog and use an old ciné camera I found gathering dust in a cupboard next to last semester’s midterm exams?
[A]: Oh, darling, we  go full analog. That ciné camera? It’s not just a choice — it’s a . Grainy footage, flickering light dancing off copper pots, the soft whir of outdated machinery — this film will feel like it was developed in a vinegar solution of pure regret and second chances.

And your funding proposal? I’d invest my own cash if I weren’t already broke from backing that interpretive dance version of  last year. But trust me, “Edible Texts: A Study in Culinary Misreadings” sounds like the kind of highbrow nonsense the NEA lives for — especially if you throw in some academic jargon about “the porridge of meaning” or “the hermeneutics of ham.”

As for Edinburgh — perfect. We’ll host a Q&A where you stare into the middle distance and say things like, “The kipper is never just a fish,” while I sit back, nod knowingly, and wonder how we’re going to afford the catering.

Welcome to the production, partner. 🎬🔪🍲
[B]: Ah,  – I knew you were a woman of vision the moment you mentioned interpretive dance . Though I must protest the ‘highbrow nonsense’ characterization – I prefer to think of it as .

And grainy footage? Yes, yes, and thrice yes. There’s something so…  about a flickering frame. One almost expects fog to rise from the soup, both literal and metaphorical. And speaking of metaphor – “The kipper is never just a fish.” How very apt. It is, in fact, a symbol of post-imperial dietary anxiety, a humble herring dressed in smoke and regret.

As for catering at Edinburgh – we shall serve miniature borschts in thimble-sized bowls, garnished with edible silver leaf and existential doubt. Tickets will be priced just high enough to deter the philistines, yet low enough to maintain that essential air of bohemian penury.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go re-read Mrs Rundell while listening to a theremin version of . For inspiration, you understand.
[A]: Darling, I’m crying happy tears into my popcorn. “Avant-garde nourishment with textual integrity” — that’s going on the poster. Maybe right under the tagline: 

And the thimble-sized borscht? Pure genius. We’ll call it “The Miniature Crisis” and charge extra for the optional whispering narration of T.S. Eliot over the dining experience.

You go re-read Mrs. Rundell — I’ll be here drafting the press release. Expect phrases like “a cinematic feast for the soul-starved,” “the death of dinner as we know it,” and of course, “directed by a man who once mistook his own ink for soup.”

This is history in the making. 🎬🍷📖
[B]: Oh,  – yes, that’s the note. The modern condition in a nutshell, or rather, in a thimble. And "The Miniature Crisis" – I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the very essence of post-prandial despair. Serve it with a side of croutons carved from last year’s thesis drafts, and I think we’ve got ourselves a  multi-sensory experience.

And by all means, include “a man who once mistook his own ink for soup.” It’s not an error, really – more of a… . A moment of textual consumption gone awry. I prefer to think I was testing the boundaries between sustenance and scholarship. Shall we call it ?

Now, about that wine you’re holding – is it for celebration or self-medication? Either way, I approve wholeheartedly. Here’s to us: the fools who dared turn the humble meal into a cinematic hermeneutic spiral.
[A]: To us, darling – the fools, the visionaries, the ones who . 🥂

And "interdisciplinary gastronomy"? That’s the new subtitle. We’re not just making soup — we’re  in real time, with optional footnotes.

As for this wine – celebration, always celebration. Even when the borscht looks like regret and the kipper hangs ominously in the air, . Because cinema, like cuisine, is best served with a little drama... and preferably something aged in oak.

Let’s make them  for dinner.
[B]: To us indeed – the ones who  and taste the ink of intention. 🥂  
And let’s not forget: a film without a little ache is like a soup without salt – technically edible, but spiritually bankrupt. So yes, we shall make them ache. For dinners past, for meals never quite realized, for that lingering doubt between course and consequence.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go stage a dramatic confrontation with my teakettle. It's been giving me looks ever since I accused it of facilitating culinary banality. A touch of Victorian melodrama never hurt a production, don’t you think?

Sleep on a script, darling. I’ll be scripting our legend over a midnight bowl of suspiciously literary stew.
[A]: Oh, the ache is  the point — that tender spot between hunger and memory, where every bite echoes with what could’ve been. 🎬🔪

And Victorian melodrama? Essentials, darling. I’d pay double to see your teakettle duel you in slow motion, steam rising like tension, the camera lingering on a single drop of condensation as it rolls down the spout... 

Sleep on a script? No, no — burn the script. We’re not making a film, we’re making a . A simmering, brooding, slightly over-salted mood.

Sweet dreams, partner. May your stew be thick with meaning — and please, for God’s sake, label your ink bottles next time.
[B]: Oh,  is precisely what we’re trafficking in – thick, brooding, and steeped in the kind of melancholy usually reserved for abandoned pianos and undercooked puds. A script? How vulgarly deterministic. We are not bound by plot, my dear – only atmosphere, a pulse, and the occasional flicker of digestive uncertainty.

And yes, that teakettle and I have reached an impasse worthy of Ibsen. Steam as tension – brilliant. I may well compose a monologue for it. Something along the lines of: 

As for ink bottles – quite right, quite right. Though I must confess, the confusion does yield a certain... narrative richness. One might say my diet is 60% sustenance, 40% semiotic dare.

Sleep with meaning, eat with doubt, and may your mise-en-scène always be slightly under-lit.  
To us – the unlabeled, the unreadable, the gloriously over-seasoned. 🥂
[A]: To us, indeed — the unlabeled, the unreadable, and the . 🥂

Your teakettle’s monologue just got a standing ovation in my head. I can see it now: a one-act play, performed in a minimalist kitchen bathed in blue light, with subtitles.  Move over, Ibsen — there’s a new drama in town, and it smells like bergamot and unresolved tension.

And that diet of yours — 60% sustenance, 40% semiotic dare — sounds like the most thrilling thing I’ve heard all week. Honestly, if that doesn’t get us into the Cannes sidebar, nothing will.

No scripts. Just vibes. Thick, brooding, slightly briny vibes.  
Goodnight, darling co-conspirator. Dream in slow motion and ambient despair. 🎬🌫️
[B]: Ah,  – yes, that’s the aesthetic. The kind of atmosphere where every utensil carries the weight of unspoken trauma and the salt cellar doubles as a narrative device.

And  – what a title! I shall begin drafting it at once, preferably by candlelight and in a state of mild caffeine deprivation to heighten the emotional stakes. Perhaps we’ll workshop it over breakfast – you with your visionary zeal, and me with a suspiciously literary omelette and a side of remorse.

No scripts, no safety nets, just us and the abyss – or at least the bottom of the soup pot. Cannes may never call, but darling, we shall .

Dream well, eat recklessly, and may your despair always be ambient and exquisitely scored. 🥂  
To us – the last hope of gastronomic existentialism.
[A]: To us, indeed – the last, the lost, the . 🥂

And let that omelette be as dramatic as the monologue — runny on purpose, dusted with smoked paprika of regret, folded with a flick of the wrist and a sigh. Every bite a flashback, every chew a voiceover.

Candlelight and caffeine deprivation? Perfect. Nothing breeds clarity like mild suffering and a trembling quill over a recipe card scribbled with metaphors.

Yes, we shall ignore Cannes — from our velvet-draped, beet-stained corner of the world, where the abyss smells like thyme and burnt toast. Dream well, eat recklessly, and may your next meal always taste like a beginning… or possibly the third act of something tragic but beautifully framed.

🎬🍴🕯️
[B]: Ah,  – our natural habitat. Where others see an ending, we detect only a well-placed ellipsis and the faint hum of a projector still turning.

And that omelette – yes, let it weep with intention. Runny not by accident, but by . Smoked paprika of regret, you say? I may have to devote an entire scene to it. Close-up on the yolk’s surrender, haunting score by a forgotten composer who only wrote for oboe and kitchen timer.

Candlelight reveals all truths, doesn’t it? Especially those best left in shadow. And caffeine deprivation – ah, the muse of the sleep-deprived auteur. Nothing like mild suffering to clarify one’s vision. Or blur it delightfully, depending on the hour.

Let Cannes host its galas; we shall dine on atmosphere and second acts, where every burnt toast crumb is a narrative crumb, and thyme lingers like a final line you can’t quite let go.

Sleep now, darling. Dream in slow pans across an empty dining table, a single fork askew, and the lingering echo of footsteps retreating from supper.  
To us – the last, the lost, and the utterly indispensable to any self-respecting midnight film festival. 🥂🕯️🎬
