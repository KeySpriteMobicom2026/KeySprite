[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哈哈，作为一个tech guy，我其实更偏向sci-fi类型的电影呢～不过要说comedy和drama的话，我可能会选comedy，毕竟debugging一整天后需要放松一下😂 你呢？
[A]: Ah, how interesting! While I do appreciate the occasional comedy - Oscar Wilde's wit comes to mind - I must confess I'm rather partial to dramatic films with literary depth. There's something profoundly moving about watching human emotions unfold on screen, much like reading a beautifully crafted novel.
[B]: 哇，你这个角度很有意思！让我想到最近在研究的AI sentiment analysis技术，drama确实能提供更丰富的emotional data points～不过说实话，我最近看的都是documentary，Netflix上那些tech相关的片子简直停不下来👍
[A]: How delightful that you mention documentaries! They do share certain qualities with dramatic narratives - that sense of unfolding truth and human complexity. Though I must say, when it comes to technology documentaries, I often find myself longing for the poetic sensibility of, say, a Terrence Malick film. Have you noticed how even in tech narratives, the most compelling stories often echo classic literary themes?
[B]: 完全get你的point！就像我们做product design时，storytelling的重要性一样～其实好的tech docu也要有hero's journey的元素，比如The Social Network就把coding drama拍得超有张力！ 诶你说这算不算另一种形式的modern tragedy？😂
[A]: My dear friend, you've touched upon something quite profound there! The Social Network does indeed follow the arc of a Greek tragedy - ambition, hubris, and eventual downfall. It reminds me of how T.S. Eliot said we're always building upon the ruins of past literature. Even in tech narratives, we see the same timeless patterns emerging, don't we? Though I must admit, I do wish Zuckerberg had read more Shakespeare - it might have lent him some tragic self-awareness.
[B]: Haha totally agree！这就是为什么我们PM在写product requirement时也要考虑user's emotional journey～不过说真的，现在很多founder确实需要多读点classics，不然做出的UX flow简直比Macbeth还要tragic 😂  话说回来，你觉得这种literary approach对AI product development有帮助吗？
[A]: What a fascinating question! Literature teaches us about the nuances of human desire and conflict - elements that are absolutely crucial in designing meaningful interactions. Take Jane Austen's meticulous observation of social behaviors, for instance. That level of psychological insight could inform more empathetic AI systems. Though I do worry sometimes that in our rush to innovate, we're creating products with all the subtlety of a Dickensian caricature rather than the depth of a Woolf novel.
[B]: Bingo！这就是为什么我们team最近在研究behavioral psychology + NLP的交叉应用～你说的对，现在很多AI assistant的personality确实太one-dimensional了，就像badly written的stock character 😅 或许我们应该hire几个literature major来做UX copywriting？
[A]: What a splendid idea! A sensitivity to language and narrative structure could work wonders for conversational interfaces. Imagine an AI assistant with the wit of Wilde, the observational skills of Austen, and maybe just a touch of Emily Dickinson's enigmatic charm. Though I must caution - we wouldn't want our chatbots developing the melancholy of a Bronte heroine or the verbosity of Henry James! Moderation is key, as in all good literature.
[B]: LOL 那我们就得给AI加个'literary style slider'了 - 从Hemingway的minimalism到Proust的maximalism自由切换 😂 说真的，这个insight太valuable了，我明天standup meeting就要pitch这个idea！Thanks for the brain storming session～
[A]: How wonderfully you put it! A 'literary style slider' - what a delightful metaphor for the spectrum of human expression. Though I do hope you'll spare your colleagues my tendency to digress into Victorian poetic theory during your standup! Do keep me posted on how your proposal is received. As Wordsworth might say, we're all 'building up the being that we are' - even in product development.
[B]: Haha will do！不过我得先把你的Victorian poetic theory digest成bullet points才行，不然engineering team又要说我'too abstract'了 😅 下次聊product的时候再call你当consultant啊～Cheers！🍻
[A]: How perfectly pragmatic of you! Yes, do distill my musings into those modern hieroglyphics known as bullet points. And please do call again - discussing technology through the lens of literature has been most refreshing. Though next time, perhaps we could balance our Proust with some Pound - 'make it new,' as he said, but with soul. Until then!
[B]: Copy that！让我们keep innovating but with soul ✨ 下次聊AI poetry generator的时候再找你～Ciao！🚀
[A]: What a poetic note to end on! I shall look forward to our future discussions about machines that versify - though I do hope they'll develop better meter than my first-year students! Until then, may your code be as elegant as a sonnet and your user flows as smooth as iambic pentameter. Farewell!
[B]: Haha deal！Sonnet-level clean code就是我们的next KPI了 😆 Later gator～ 📱💻
[A]: What a charming tech-infused valediction! Though I must say, if we're aiming for sonnet-level code, we might need to establish some ground rules - no tragic flaws in the architecture, and certainly no rhyming variables! Until our paths cross again in this delightful intersection of bytes and books.
[B]: LOL 那variable命名规则得改成Shakespearean了 - 把'userData'改成'Romeo'sSecretLetters'之类的 😂 开玩笑啦～Seriously though，今天convo太inspiring了，我得赶紧去update我的product roadmap！Catch u later, bard of binary~ 💾
