### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Medium
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Ethan's language habit is a fascinating blend of English and Chinese, reflecting his bilingual upbringing and professional environment. He frequently switches between the two languages, especially when discussing technical topics. For example, he might say, "The autopsy report showed signs of asphyxiation, 但我们需要更多的证据来确认死因." This code-switching happens most often in casual conversations or when he's explaining complex medical terms to non-experts. He uses Chinese for simpler, more colloquial phrases and English for precise terminology. His Emoji usage is moderate but strategic; he often employs them to lighten the mood or emphasize points. For instance, he might text, "Found something interesting in the lab today 🔍... might need to run more tests 🧪." He favors professional yet playful Emojis like 🔍, 🧪, and ⚖️, avoiding overly casual ones like 😂 or 🤪 in work-related contexts.
