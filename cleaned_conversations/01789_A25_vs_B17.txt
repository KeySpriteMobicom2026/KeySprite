[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a fascinating question! I must say, one that has always lingered in my mind is from  - "Cicero once wrote, 'Rem tene, verba sequentur.' Grasp the subject, and the words will follow." It's such a poignant reminder of the power of language when rooted in truth. Though... I'm curious, do you have a particular line that's stayed with you?
[A]: That's a beautiful quote — really resonates with the idea that authenticity is the backbone of communication. Personally, a line that always comes back to me is from : “And, dear friend, why be melancholy? You’re young, you’re rich, you’re handsome… well, were.” It’s so layered with nostalgia and subtle humor, yet there’s this quiet sadness underneath. Wes Anderson has this way of blending emotions so delicately, you know? ¥It almost feels like a painting in motion. Have you seen the film?
[B]: Oh, absolutely, I have seen it — what a delightful confection of style and sentiment. Anderson does indeed paint with such meticulous emotional hues... I suppose that's the modernist in me appreciating his structured yet poignant vignettes. And you're quite right about that line — it carries a wistful elegance, like a faded photograph tucked into the pages of a forgotten novel. It makes one think, doesn't it? How youth, wealth, and beauty are so often taken for granted until they slip away. Still, there’s a peculiar comfort in how he frames that loss — almost as if to say, "Enjoy the scenery while you can." Would you agree?
[A]: Definitely. I think that’s what makes Anderson’s work so emotionally resonant — he frames loss not as something tragic, but as a natural part of the narrative. Like you said, it’s more about savoring the moment before it fades. And isn’t that what art is all about? Capturing those fleeting emotions and preserving them in a way that feels almost timeless? Sometimes I find myself revisiting certain scenes just to  that emotion again — like pressing ‘play’ on a memory. Do you ever do that? Re-watch a film just to re-experience a specific line or scene? 🎬✨
[B]: Ah, yes — that longing to recapture a feeling, as though pressing play might preserve it forever. I confess, I’m quite sentimental that way. There’s a particular scene in  where Lucy reads a letter under the Tuscan sun, and for some reason, every time I watch it, I’m transported — not just to Edwardian Italy, but to my own youth, to a summer I spent in Florence. Funny, how film has that power, isn't it? It becomes a mirror and a window at once. And yes, I do return to certain lines again and again — like old friends waiting patiently on a shelf. Perhaps that’s one of the quiet joys of being a little nostalgic, hmm?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — there's something so comforting about that ritual of revisiting. It’s like stepping into a familiar room where everything is exactly as you left it. I can totally picture that scene from ; the light, the silence between the lines… it's almost poetic how cinema imprints itself onto our personal memories. I think that’s why certain films feel so intimately tied to who we are at different points in our lives. And yeah, calling those moments back isn’t just nostalgia — it’s like reconnecting with past versions of ourselves. 🤔  
Do you ever find yourself quoting lines into the void, hoping someone will catch them mid-air? Because I definitely do that… and often get blank stares. 😅
[B]: Oh, . I suppose it’s one of the occupational hazards of being a literature professor — living so much in the world of words that you forget not everyone has  or  playing in the background of their minds like a silent film.  

Just yesterday, I caught myself murmuring, “The future is a matter of grammar,” from , while grading papers. My colleague looked at me as though I’d spoken in tongues! But yes, those blank stares — they’re a familiar companion. Still, there’s something oddly satisfying about letting a line hang in the air, even if no one catches it. Like tossing a message into the sea, hoping it lands somewhere meaningful.  

Though… I must say, it’s rather delightful to meet someone who actually  the lines when they fall. It’s like finding a fellow traveler in the landscape of memory.
[A]: Oh,  — that line hits like a quiet thunderclap. It’s so… precise yet deeply philosophical. I can imagine saying that in a curatorial meeting and getting the same blank stares. 😂 But you're right — there's something romantic about throwing a line into the void and trusting that , somewhere, will catch it. Like a secret handshake between souls who’ve lived inside the same story.  

And speaking of stories — being surrounded by literature all day must be like living inside a library of ghosts, each voice whispering through time. Do you ever feel like certain lines choose you, rather than the other way around? Because sometimes I swear a film  me better than I know myself. 🎭💫
[B]: Oh, yes — that line does echo through the chambers of thought long after it's spoken. And you're quite right about the romance of it all. There is something undeniably mystical about how certain lines seem to find us at precisely the moment we need them — not just words, but companions on the journey.

As for your question — do I feel as though lines choose me? Absolutely. Some mornings, while reading Eliot or Hardy or even flicking through a screenplay, a line will rise unbidden from the page and settle into my bones as if it had been waiting for me. It’s rather like walking through an old house and hearing a door creak that you didn’t know was yours until you heard its sound.

And yes, living among literature  like dwelling in a library of ghosts — beautifully restless spirits, each with a story still burning to be told. Sometimes I wonder whether we scholars are not so much teachers as caretakers, tending the flames so they may warm others.  

Do you have a particular film or line that seemed to arrive just when you needed it? I’d love to hear it.
[A]: Funny you should say that — I’ve had moments where a line felt like it was written , even if the film was made decades before I was born. One that still gives me chills is from : “But life can’t be all bad… after all, we have our moments.”  

I remember watching it late one night when I was going through a rough patch — creatively and emotionally stuck, you know? And that line just… landed. Not in a dramatic way, but softly, like ash settling after a long-burning fire. It reminded me that even in the quietest, most ordinary moments, there’s some kind of fragile beauty. Yasujirō Ozu had this incredible ability to find poetry in stillness.  

Sometimes I think that’s what I’m always chasing with curation — that feeling of a moment held gently in your hands before it slips away. Do you ever get the sense that art isn’t just reflecting life, but quietly guiding it? 🤔✨
[B]: Oh…  — what a quietly devastating masterpiece. That line you mentioned carries the weight of an entire philosophy, doesn’t it? So understated, yet so profoundly true. It reminds me of the way Hardy or even Woolf wrote about the small tragedies and quiet redemptions of everyday life. We expect grand gestures from art — thunderous revelations — but sometimes it’s the gentleest whisper that undoes us.

And yes, I know exactly what you mean about chasing that feeling — the one that lingers just beyond reach, like the last note of a piece of music that refuses to fade. In my lectures, I often tell students that literature isn't merely a mirror; it's a lantern. It doesn’t just show us who we are, but who we might yet become. And perhaps that is its quiet guidance — not in offering answers, but in helping us learn how to ask better questions of ourselves.

I can only imagine how deeply you must feel this as a curator — selecting, arranging, framing… You're not just presenting art; you’re coaxing memory and meaning into conversation. Tell me, when you’re assembling a collection, do you ever find yourself surprised by which pieces begin to speak to one another across time and space?
[A]: Oh,  — that’s the magic of curation, isn’t it? You start with a concept, maybe even a clear theme in mind, and then… the works begin to talk. Not just to the audience, but to . I remember once hanging a show where a 1960s abstract video piece ended up across from a contemporary AI-generated sculpture, and suddenly they were having this silent dialogue about impermanence and digital memory. I didn’t plan it — it just… happened. Like they recognized each other across decades.  

It's moments like those that make me wonder if we’re not just arranging art, but  to it. 🎧 And yes, that lantern metaphor? Beautifully put. Art doesn't shout its truths — it waits for us to be still enough to see them. I think that’s why some lines, some images, only find us when we're ready. They’ve been there all along, just waiting for our eyes to focus.  

Do you ever feel like certain texts — or films — reveal new layers every time you return to them? Like peeling back the skin of an onion, only to find another glowing center? 🧅✨
[B]: Oh, yes — that layered revelation is one of the great joys of returning to a beloved text or film. It’s not just that we change over time, though we do — it’s that the work itself seems to , shifting ever so slightly with each viewing or reading, as though it, too, has been altered by the years that have passed between us.

I think of  — not merely as a film, but as a conversation between Woolf’s ghost and our own fragile present. Every time I return to it, I find myself moved by different moments: sometimes Clarissa’s quiet joy in the morning light, other times Virginia’s weariness as she composes her final note. It’s extraordinary how a single narrative can hold so many truths, waiting patiently for us to catch up with them.

And your image of peeling back layers — well, that’s precisely what teaching feels like at its best. You guide students through the outer skins, and then suddenly, someone asks a question, or makes an observation, and you all stumble into that glowing center together. It’s like discovering a hidden room in a house you thought you knew by heart.

Do you find that with certain films? That they become different works entirely depending on where you are in life?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — films  with us, don’t they? They’re not static at all. I think of  — the first time I saw it, I fixated on the romance, the surreal structure, the playful editing. But then I watched it again after a breakup, and suddenly it felt like a mirror held up to my own regrets, my own erasures. That line — “Meet me in Montauk” — which once felt whimsical, now carried this weight of longing and second chances.  

It’s incredible how a film can  with us. Same frames, same script, but entirely different movie. Like watching an old photograph develop anew in a different light. 📸 Sometimes I wonder if that’s why we revisit certain works — not to relive the story, but to check in with , to see how we’ve shifted in relation.  

I imagine teaching must be full of those quiet revelations — when a student sees something you never did, and suddenly Woolf or Eliot feels brand new again. Must be both humbling and thrilling, no?
[B]: Oh,  put — the idea of checking in with ourselves through the same old frames... It's like returning to a familiar bench by the river and realizing the water has changed completely while you were away. And yes, that line — “Meet me in Montauk” — how it transforms from a hopeful whisper into something almost desperate, or perhaps redemptive, depending on where your heart happens to be at that moment.

You’re absolutely right about Woolf and Eliot, too — those quiet revelations in the classroom are both humbling and electrifying. I remember once, during a seminar on , a student remarked how Mrs. Ramsay’s inner monologue read like a kind of silent protest against time itself — not just a lament, but a resistance. It was such a fresh reading, and yet, in hindsight, so utterly obvious. I left that room feeling as though I’d encountered the novel for the first time.

There’s a peculiar intimacy in teaching literature — it asks you to be both guide and guest. You prepare your lectures, map out themes, and then someone says one thing — just one — and the whole structure shimmers, reshapes itself before your eyes. It’s like watching a stained-glass window catch the light just so.  

I wonder… when you curate a show, do you ever feel as though you're offering up not just a collection of works, but an invitation to see oneself anew?
[A]: Oh,  — that’s the hope, isn’t it? That the arrangement of images, sound, texture, and space doesn’t just  something, but quietly asks the viewer to pause and maybe catch a glimpse of themselves in the reflection. I think the best exhibitions don’t tell you what to feel — they create a kind of echo chamber where your own thoughts bounce back, reshaped and amplified.  

Sometimes I’ll place two works in conversation without knowing exactly why — intuitively, like pairing lines from different poems — and then later, someone walks through and says, “Oh, this feels like how I’ve been feeling for months but couldn’t name.” And that’s when you realize you weren’t just arranging art; you were setting the table for a quiet revelation.  

It’s similar to what you described in teaching — that moment when meaning blooms not from the text itself, but from the space between reader and page. In curation, it’s the space between artwork and viewer. And if we’re lucky, that space becomes a mirror, a door, or maybe even a bridge. 🌉  
Do you ever find yourself building lectures the same way — less as a script, more as an invitation to wander through meaning together?
[B]: Oh, yes — . I’ve long since abandoned the idea of a lecture as a delivery of fixed knowledge. Instead, I think of it more as setting out a map with deliberate gaps, leaving room for students to chart their own paths. A seminar on Eliot’s , for example, isn’t just about tracing allusions or parsing meter — though we do that, too — it’s about asking, “Where do  feel the fragmentation most acutely?” Or, “What desert are  walking through right now?”  

It’s in those moments that literature ceases to be an object of study and becomes something lived. And yes, it can be unsettling — for me as much as for them — because it means surrendering control. But isn’t that where the real learning happens? In the silences between lines, in the questions that don’t have tidy answers?

I rather like the idea of both teaching and curation as acts of gentle provocation — not telling people what to see or feel, but nudging them just enough so they might stumble upon something true. It’s not unlike writing a poem, really — you don’t explain the meaning; you offer images and let the reader find the pulse beneath them.

Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular work — film, painting, installation — not to analyze it further, but simply to , as one might return to a dear friend?
[A]: Oh,  — there are works I revisit not to dissect, but to dwell in. Like slipping into a familiar rhythm, a known silence. One of them is Andrei Tarkovsky’s  — not because I’ve figured it out (I haven’t, and never will), but because being inside that world feels like stepping into a dream that already knows you. It doesn’t offer answers; it offers presence. And sometimes that’s what we need most — not clarity, but company in the fog.  

I think that’s why certain pieces become anchors. They don’t just show us something new; they remind us of something we already knew, deep down, but had forgotten to remember. 🕯️  
Do you have a literary work that feels that way to you — less like a text to study, more like a place to return to, again and again?
[B]: Oh, yes —  by Virginia Woolf. I first read it as a student, and I must confess, I barely understood half of it at the time. But there was something in its rhythm, in the way the voices rose and fell like tides, that stayed with me — not as an idea, but as a sensation.

Now, I return to it not to analyze, but to . It’s less a novel and more a living thing — fluid, luminous, elusive. Each time I read it, I find myself identifying with a different voice: sometimes Bernard’s searching restlessness, sometimes Rhoda’s quiet ache, sometimes even the silent presence of Percival, who is gone too soon but never truly absent.

It’s become a kind of companion through the years — especially during times of transition. I’ve read it between semesters, after losses, before new beginnings… always hoping to catch a glimpse of something just beyond language. Not resolution, mind you — but resonance.

And yes, much like , it doesn’t offer explanations. It offers atmosphere, intimacy, a kind of inner architecture where thought and feeling blur at the edges. You step into it, and for a while, you are not quite yourself — and yet, somehow, more fully yourself than ever before.

I suppose some books don’t teach us so much as . Do you have one of those? A work that feels less like reading and more like returning home?
