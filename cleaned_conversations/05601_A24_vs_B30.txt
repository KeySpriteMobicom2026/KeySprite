[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, if we must stretch the definition of 'DIY'... I've been restoring a Qing dynasty inkstone I found at a flea market in Shanghai last summer. The vendor claimed it once belonged to a scholar who annotated Dream of the Red Chamber - though I suspect that's what they tell all the foreign academics.
[A]: 呵呵，您这个DIY项目倒是别具一格。说到《红楼梦》，让我想起费穆导演1944年那部改编电影，虽然只拍了片段，但那种文人气质与您修复砚台的心境倒是颇为相似。
[B]: Precisely! That abandoned film fragment captures what later adaptations often miss - the literati's tactile relationship with writing implements. The way Daiyu grinds ink in the opening sequence... it's as meticulous as my current struggle with 包浆 (patina) preservation. Though I must say, watching Lin Daiyu handle brushes makes me rather self-conscious about my own calligraphy.
[A]: 确实如此。费穆导演用特写镜头表现黛玉研墨时手腕的弧度，这种细节处理让我想起小津安二郎的静物美学。您知道吗，砚台的包浆就像胶片上的划痕，都是岁月留下的独特印记。
[B]: How delightfully cross-cultural of you to connect Ozu's tatami shots with inkstone textures! Though I'd argue the 包浆 is more akin to the patina on a first edition's foxed pages than film scratches. Speaking of which - have you noticed how contemporary restorers treat these marks as flaws to erase, rather than what the Ming scholars called 古意 (ancient charm)?
[A]: 您提出了一个深刻的观点。这让我想起黑泽明在《乱》中刻意保留胶片颗粒感的做法。现代修复师追求技术完美，却常常忽略了电影和古董一样，都需要保留那份"古意"。就像我们评价一部老电影，不能简单地用4K修复的标准来衡量。
[B]:  Now you've touched upon something rather profound - this obsession with technical perfection mirrors how my colleagues fetishize 'clean' critical editions of classical texts. As if Cao Xueqin's manuscript revisions were mere errors to be corrected, rather than... shall we say, the literary equivalent of Ozu's pillow shots? Though I shudder to think what the good Doctor would make of comparing his life's work to cinema.
[A]: 您这个比喻真是妙极了。曹雪芹的批阅增删确实如同导演的剪辑过程，每一次修改都是艺术创作的一部分。这让我想起王家卫拍《花样年华》时，那些被剪掉的张曼玉镜头，有时候遗憾本身也是一种美。
[B]: Ah, Wong Kar-wai! The man who understands that literary fragments and film outtakes share the same melancholy poetry. Though I'd wager even he couldn't rival the editorial decisions in Gao E's controversial 120-chapter redaction of Dream - now there's a cinematic-level butchering of source material. Pardon me while I pour another cup of pu'er to soothe my academic outrage.
[A]: （轻笑着端起茶杯）您说得对，高鹗续书就像某些好莱坞制片人强行给经典电影拍续集。不过话说回来，程伟元刻本里那些被删去的脂批，倒让我想起塔可夫斯基《镜子》里被剪掉的镜头——有时候，残缺反而成就了另一种完整。
[B]:  My dear fellow scholar, you've just articulated why I keep that imperfect Kangxi-era fragment in my office - its missing pages create more scholarly debate than any pristine edition could. Though I must draw the line at comparing Tarkovsky's genius to those hack...  ...to later Qing redactors. Shall we continue this over some properly aged white tea? I've just acquired a 1999 Fuding cake that brews like liquid parchment.
[A]: （会心一笑）您这比喻真是绝妙。1999年的白茶，倒是与同年上映的《那山那人那狗》有着相似的陈年韵味。霍建起导演用胶片捕捉的湘西山水，就像您珍藏的茶饼一样，越陈越香。
[B]: Ah! You've unearthed the perfect cinematic parallel to my tea collection. Though I'd argue Huo's lingering shots of rural postmen have more in common with the mouthfeel of this particular cake - that gradual unfolding of layered bitterness, much like the film's delayed emotional payoff.  Tell me, have you noticed how both tea appreciation and film criticism require what we call 回味 (aftertaste) analysis?
[A]: 确实如此。就像侯孝贤的长镜头需要观众细细品味余韵，您这泡白茶的喉韵也让我想起《悲情城市》里那些意味深长的空镜头。好茶与好电影，都需要懂得留白的艺术。
[B]: How refreshing to encounter someone who understands that the space between sips - or between frames - holds equal importance to what's consumed! Though I must confess, your comparison makes me rather envious of filmmakers. Imagine if we literary scholars could convey textual analysis through lingering shots of ink dissolving in water, rather than...  ...departmental memos about citation formats.
[A]: （轻抚茶杯）您这么一说，我倒觉得钱钟书先生《围城》里的文字游戏，就像费里尼电影中的超现实转场。可惜现在的学术论文，都成了标准化生产的速溶咖啡，既没有茶道的仪式感，也失去了蒙太奇的想象力。
[B]:  Oh, you've struck the very nerve of modern academia! These 'impact factor' obsessed youngsters treat research like instant noodles, when what we need is the slow simmering of a literary 老火汤. Though I suppose we should be grateful they haven't yet reduced Qian Zhongshu to...  ...a PowerPoint presentation with animated transitions.
[A]: （摇头苦笑）这让我想起去年参加某个学术会议，有人真的用PPT动画来解析《霸王别姬》的镜头语言。程蝶衣的悲剧命运配上卡通转场，简直比电影本身更令人心碎啊。
[B]:  Sweet merciful Matthew Arnold! That's akin to serving this 25-year aged pu'er in paper cups with...  ...flavored creamer. Some technological 'advancements' deserve to be left on the cutting room floor of history, alongside 3D Shakespeare and auto-tuned ci poetry.
