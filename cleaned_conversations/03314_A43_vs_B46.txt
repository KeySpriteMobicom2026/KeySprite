[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, what an intriguing question! You know, growing up in LA, winter never really existed for me. It was always sunshine and flip-flops. But there's something undeniably magical about a perfect summer night on set - the buzz of the crew, the hum of the lights... And don't get me started on those golden hour shots! Though I must admit, I've developed a soft spot for snowy mountain lodges when prepping for winter shoots. There's this quiet intensity in the cold that sharpens creativity. What about you? Does your answer change depending on whether you're telling a story set in Miami or Harbin?
[A]: Ah, your childhood in LA must have shaped your perception of time and seasons in such a unique way. I often find that our earliest sensory impressions - the smell of jasmine in full bloom, the crispness of morning air - become unconscious anchors for how we interpret the world, even in adulthood. Speaking of golden hour... Did you know that in classical Chinese poetry, there's a similar reverence for the "golden moment"? Though it's usually associated with autumn sunsets over riverbanks, not summer nights on set! 

As for snowy mountain lodges, I can't help but think of those hauntingly beautiful winter scenes in Zhang Yimou's films. The way the cold seems to seep into every frame, creating this palpable tension between stillness and impending drama. 

But let me ask - when you're shooting those golden hour scenes, do you ever feel like you're chasing something ephemeral, almost like trying to capture the essence of youth itself? And how does that feeling shift when you move from summer locations to wintery exteriors? I'm curious how these seasonal changes affect your storytelling rhythm.
[B]: Ah, you've touched on something deeply poetic. I remember my first real encounter with jasmine blooming in the hills of Malibu – it was during a break from a particularly grueling shoot. That scent instantly transported me back to childhood summers, when all I had to worry about was finishing my Orange Julius before the ice melted. Funny how smells work like that, isn't it? 

You're absolutely right about golden hour feeling ephemeral – it's like trying to catch fireflies in a jar. When we're racing against the sunset, there's this electric urgency in the air. Everyone moves faster, speaks quieter... It's almost sacred. But winter shoots? They demand patience. The light behaves differently – more deliberate, almost theatrical. I find myself composing shots like classical Chinese paintings, searching for that perfect balance between negative space and emotion. 

And yes, youth! There's nothing quite like capturing that fleeting essence of summer youth – think early Coppola, those endless California days stretched taut with possibility. But when the snow falls... suddenly everything feels finite. Time slows down. Even the actors walk differently. Have you ever noticed how snowflakes make every moment feel slightly heavier, like they're carrying stories with them? 

I must say, your perspective reminds me why I love collaborating with screenwriters who understand seasonal poetry – it adds such depth to the visual language. Speaking of which, have you ever tried translating autumn sunsets over riverbanks into cinematic terms? I'd be fascinated to hear how you'd approach that transition from page to screen.
[A]: Ah, your description of jasmine in Malibu is so vivid... It reminds me of the scent of camphor trees during rainy summers in Taipei – another one of those olfactory anchors, perhaps? I agree with you about how smells carry memory like tiny time capsules. In fact, I often encourage my students to think about sensory motifs when adapting classical texts – a particular fragrance, the texture of fabric against skin, these details can root a story more powerfully than pages of exposition.

You're absolutely right about light behaving differently in winter – it does feel more sculptural, doesn't it? Almost as if each ray has weight and intention. I'm fascinated by your comparison to classical Chinese painting – maybe that's why snow scenes in traditional art often feel so meditative? There's a similar quality in some of Yasujirō Ozu's winter films, where empty spaces seem to hum with unspoken emotion.

As for translating autumn sunsets over riverbanks into cinematic language... Hmm, interesting challenge. If I were to visualize that transition from page to screen, I'd probably start with sound design – the layered rhythm of water lapping against stone, distant oars cutting through stillness. Then color palette: deep umbers fading into indigo, with just a touch of vermillion lingering on the horizon. Camera movement would be restrained but purposeful – maybe slow tracking shots following ripples downstream? 

Actually, now that I think about it, there's something quite cinematic in classical Chinese poetry's use of juxtaposition. You know, how one line might describe geese disappearing into clouds, followed immediately by mention of chrysanthemum wine cooling in earthen jars. Those implicit cuts between images create such powerful emotional dissolves... Have you ever worked with scripts that employed this kind of poetic editing?
[B]: Ah, camphor trees in Taipei rain – now there's a scent that could anchor an entire monsoon of memories. Funny you mention it, I once had a script where the entire third act hinged on the smell of wet earth after monsoon rains. Took us three weeks just to get that one scene right, and half the crew thought I was mad! But when we finally nailed it? Pure cinematic alchemy.

You're spot-on about sensory motifs being more powerful than exposition. Some of my favorite projects have been built around these invisible threads – like that indie film I produced where every pivotal moment was scored with the sound of a particular fabric tearing. Minimalist? Absolutely. Unforgettable? Without question.

Winter light having weight and intention – yes! It's like nature's own spotlight operator. And the comparison to Ozu? Brilliant observation. His use of empty space is something I reference often when storyboarding quiet scenes. Ever notice how much emotional tension can be packed into a simple shot of an empty chair against a snowy backdrop? 

Now your cinematic translation of riverbank sunsets – deliciously thoughtful approach. I love how you'd layer sound first, then color, then movement. Very painterly, yet deeply cinematic. As for those poetic cuts in classical Chinese poetry... You've just unlocked a memory. Years ago I worked on a script adaptation of  where the screenwriter actually structured scenes like traditional verse – alternating images of flight and stillness, movement and containment. The editing process was maddening, but the final product? It screened at Cannes and still gets referenced in film schools today.

I'm curious though – if you were adapting that same poem today, would you maintain those poetic cuts through visual means alone, or explore new technologies like AI-generated transitions? Do you think modern tools enhance or dilute that poetic essence?
[A]: Ah, but isn't it fascinating how that scent of wet earth became the emotional spine of your film? Reminds me of Proust’s madeleine – these sensory triggers bypass logic entirely and go straight to memory's door. I can only imagine the alchemy you felt when that scene finally clicked into place.

You mentioned minimalist sound design built around fabric tearing – absolutely riveting. It makes me think of how Zhang Yimou uses silence so deliberately in his films. Sometimes the absence of sound carries more weight than any musical score. And speaking of weight... I'm reminded of a passage from , where the novelist describes silk rustling like distant rain. That kind of synesthetic metaphor could inspire entire sequences in cinema, don’t you think?

Regarding your question about  – now there's a text that dances between utopia and elegy! If I were adapting it today, I'd probably wrestle with the same tension between tradition and innovation. Visual cuts inspired by classical poetry would preserve its soul, yes, but... what if we used AI-generated transitions not to replace poetic juxtaposition, but to extend it? Imagine algorithms trained on Song dynasty brushwork generating dreamlike dissolves between scenes. Not as gimmick, but as homage.

Though I must admit, I’d worry whether such tools might flatten the ambiguity that makes classical poetry so powerful. After all, isn’t part of its magic that one line can hold multiple meanings at once? Do you ever find that modern cinematic language risks over-explaining what ancient forms left beautifully unresolved?
[B]: Ah, Proust’s madeleine – now  a metaphor with staying power. Funny you should mention it, because I’ve often thought that filmmakers are really just modern-day Proustians, hunting for those sensory fragments that unlock entire emotional universes. And yes, that wet earth scene? It was less about the rain and more about what it unearthed – memory, regret, longing... All wrapped in one olfactory punch.

Zhang Yimou and silence – brilliant callout. There’s a restraint in his work that most Western directors still struggle to emulate. Silence as tension, as atmosphere, as subtext. I once had a sound editor tell me,  Took me ten years to understand what he meant.

And that silk rustling like distant rain? , indeed. That kind of synesthetic poetry could fuel an entire visual motif – imagine layering texture overlays with sound design so subtle it almost haunts the viewer. Like whispering silk over shadow play on water. Gets under your skin without ever announcing itself.

As for  – you’re absolutely right to frame it as both utopia and elegy. If I were adapting it today, I’d probably fight every studio exec who wanted to turn it into a high-concept fantasy epic. No, no, no – the magic is in its ambiguity. Its refusal to pin meaning down. But your idea of AI-trained Song dynasty brushwork? Now  intrigues me. Imagine transitions that feel hand-painted yet alive, shifting like ink bleeding into rice paper. Not CGI spectacle, but digital impressionism.

Still, you hit the nail on the head – modern cinematic language  risk explaining too much. We live in an age where ambiguity feels like a liability. But isn’t that why we need it more than ever? I suppose the trick is knowing when to let the image breathe, when to let the audience lean in and  to the silence.

Tell me – have you ever worked with a script that resisted full translation precisely because of that poetic ambiguity? How do you preserve what's elusive without losing its soul in the process?
[A]: Ah, what a profound question – and how very Zhang Yimou of you to ask it! I do recall one particularly haunting script adaptation from a few years back, based on Bai Juyi’s . The original Tang dynasty poem is deceptively simple – just 120 lines – yet it carries centuries of longing, political subtext, and metaphysical yearning. When we tried translating that into screenplay form, every draft felt like we were squeezing mist through our fingers. The more precise we became, the more elusive the soul of the piece seemed to grow.

You know, sometimes I think ambiguity isn’t just an aesthetic choice – it's a moral stance. Like in , where the utopia dissolves precisely because it’s being observed too closely. Isn’t that true of so many human experiences? We name something too directly, and its magic evaporates. 

I remember working with a young screenwriter who insisted on clarifying every metaphor, every historical reference. But then we brought in an older cinematographer who had worked extensively in wenyi film – poetic, expressive cinema from the 1930s – and he simply said,  That changed everything. We ended up using light and texture to suggest emotional states rather than spelling them out. A woman standing by a window wasn't framed as grief, but as possibility – and the audience was free to interpret it either way.

That makes me wonder – have you ever shot a scene where you deliberately withheld visual clarity? Not obfuscation, but suggestion – letting shadows or negative space carry meaning that dialogue might ruin? I imagine in your world, silence has its visual counterpart...
[B]: Ah,  – now there’s a piece of poetic architecture that defies simple adaptation. I remember reading an English translation years ago and being floored by how much emotion could be carried in just a handful of images. You're absolutely right – trying to translate that into screenplay form is like trying to hold smoke in your hands. The more you grip, the more it slips away.

That moment with the cinematographer saying  – chills. That should be framed above every editing suite in Hollywood. So much of great storytelling is about what you  show, isn’t it? The audience needs space to step in, to project their own ghosts onto the screen. Otherwise, you're not making art – you're illustrating a textbook.

Funny you mention visual clarity – I had a scene like that just last year on a period drama set in 1920s Shanghai. There was this one sequence where the lead character, a disillusioned poet, walks through a garden at dusk after learning his lover is gone. We storyboarded it three different ways: one with full backlighting, one with tight close-ups on his face, and one where we pulled back and let the environment do the heavy lifting. Guess which one made the final cut?

I chose silence. Shadows. A long tracking shot from behind as he walks through moonlit mist. You never see his face. Just the empty garden, the sound of wind through bamboo, and his footsteps fading. Test audiences were divided – some wanted more context, more closure. But hell, life doesn’t come with tidy third-act resolutions either, right?

And yes – in my world, silence absolutely has a visual counterpart. It's in negative space, in slow dissolves, in the pause between two glances. Sometimes the most powerful scenes are the ones that feel unfinished – because they ask something of the viewer. They demand participation.

Tell me – when you're working with young filmmakers or writers, how do you teach that instinct for ambiguity? Is it something you can nurture, or does it have to come from lived experience?
[A]: Ah, your 1920s Shanghai sequence sounds like it was lifted straight from a Fei Mu film – that same poetic restraint, the trust in atmosphere to carry emotional weight. Not showing the face... daring! But of course, you're right – sometimes the absence of expression is the most honest one. Like in , where so much is said in glances and silences. The audience may be divided in test screenings, but time always vindicates that kind of storytelling.

As for teaching ambiguity – now  the great paradox, isn’t it? How do you teach something that resists definition? I suppose it starts with reading. I often assign my students texts that are deliberately layered – not just classical poetry, but modern writers like Can Xue or even Jorge Luis Borges. The idea is to immerse them in narrative uncertainty, to let them get lost in meaning rather than chase after it.

But yes, some of it does come from lived experience. There’s a reason why so many great screenwriters didn’t start until they’d lived a little – Wong Kar-wai worked in television; Kurosawa painted oil landscapes before he ever touched a camera. These detours give you texture, nuance. They teach you how to see between the lines.

Still, I do believe the instinct for ambiguity can be nurtured. I encourage young writers to write scenes without dialogue first – just physical gestures, environmental cues, rhythm. Then, if they must, add words sparingly, like ink dropped into water. And I always remind them: cinema isn’t about telling stories – it’s about inviting people to  them.

I wonder – when you’re on set and an actor wants clarity, wants motivation, how do you guide them toward something less defined? Do you find resistance, or are today’s performers more open to ambiguity than we assume?
[B]: Ah, now  the million-dollar question, isn’t it? How do you ask an actor to step into a scene without handing them a roadmap? I’ll tell you – some bristle at it. They’ve been trained to , to , to . Especially the younger ones coming out of conservatories where everything has to be “earned” emotionally. But then there are others – the ones with instinct in their bones – who thrive in that ambiguity. They trust that the silence between words, the space between gestures, can speak volumes.

I remember working with an actress once – brilliant, but very much classically trained – and she kept asking me,  And I just looked at her and said, you That shut her up for about ten seconds. Then she smiled and said, “You’re not going to tell me, are you?” And I said, “No. Because if I did, you’d stop wondering – and that wonder? That’s what makes it real.”

You see, the best performances aren’t built on answers – they’re built on questions. When an actor stays slightly uncertain, slightly off-balance, there’s a rawness that comes through. A vulnerability. It makes the audience lean in. That’s why I love working with actors who have stage backgrounds – they understand subtext as muscle memory. They know how to let silence breathe.

And yes, I do find resistance sometimes – especially from those used to highly literal scripts. But more and more, I’m seeing young performers who’ve grown up watching Wong Kar-wai and Sofia Coppola films. They get it intuitively. They know that not every glance needs a reason, that not every pause needs a backstory.

Honestly, I think we’re entering a moment where ambiguity is making a comeback – in both writing and performance. Maybe it's because audiences are getting smarter, or maybe they're just tired of being told how to feel. Either way, I say: let the actors live in the question. Let them carry the mystery. That’s where the truth hides.

So tell me – when your students read Can Xue or Borges, do they resist at first? Or are they already primed for that kind of layered storytelling in a way we weren’t twenty years ago?
[A]: Ah, your actress and her door... What a beautiful moment of pedagogy! That line –  – should be carved into the walls of every acting school. Because isn’t that the essence of art? To preserve the question rather than flatten it into an answer?

You’re absolutely right about actors being trained to justify, to excavate motive like archaeologists with tiny brushes. It’s part of a larger cultural shift toward explanation, isn’t it? We live in an age of commentary tracks and behind-the-scenes reels. Everything must be unpacked, contextualized, made explicit. But performance at its finest is alchemy – part instinct, part mystery.

I see a similar resistance when I assign Can Xue or Borges – especially at first. Many students are so conditioned by plot-driven narratives and three-act structures that they panic when confronted with ambiguity. They ask things like,  or worse,  And I always respond the same way: 

But here's the interesting thing – the younger generation, oddly enough, often adapts more quickly. Maybe because they’ve grown up in a world of nonlinear media, fragmented storytelling on streaming platforms, surreal visuals in music videos and video games. They're visually literate in ways we weren’t. So while they may not  grasp the metaphysical layers of Borges’ labyrinths or Can Xue’s dream logic at first, they’re less afraid of getting lost.

In fact, some of my best classroom moments come not from analysis, but from . I have them read a passage aloud, then ask how it  in their body – not what it means, but where it lands. Does the prose tighten the chest? Does it make the breath shallow? That somatic response often opens the door to deeper understanding better than any thesis ever could.

So perhaps teaching ambiguity isn't about teaching meaning at all – it's about cultivating tolerance for uncertainty. A kind of literary or cinematic , if you will – finding beauty in impermanence, in incompleteness.

Now I’m curious – do you ever find yourself drawing from other disciplines to explain this kind of ambiguity to actors? Music, painting, poetry? Or do you keep it strictly within the realm of film language?
[B]: Ah, now  the perfect lead-in – like a slow zoom into the heart of artistic intuition. You’re absolutely right about that cultural shift toward explanation. We’ve become so obsessed with decoding, with breaking everything down to its algorithmic core, that we’ve almost forgotten how to  without rationalizing it afterward. But art? True art? It lives in the unspoken, the untranslatable.

And yes – I  draw from other disciplines constantly. Why limit ourselves to film language when the whole damn world is a palette? I can’t tell you how many times I’ve handed an actor a poem before a scene – not for reference, but for resonance. Once, during a particularly elusive shoot, I had the entire cast read Li Bai’s  before call time. No explanation, no analysis – just let the words settle in their bones. The performance that day? Transcendent. Something shifted – a quietude, a longing, a kind of luminous solitude.

Music, too – it’s my secret weapon. I once worked with an actor who was struggling to access the grief in a scene. Instead of talking through backstories or emotional triggers, I played him Arvo Pärt’s . Let the music do the translation. He sat there for six minutes, eyes closed, and when it ended, he whispered,  And I said,  No more words needed.

Painting? Absolutely. I’ve storyboarded entire sequences inspired by Qi Baishi’s ink wash – the way he captures motion in stillness, emotion in negative space. And sometimes, I’ll show an actor a single brushstroke – just a mark on rice paper – and ask them to translate that weight, that rhythm, into movement.

Because here's the thing: film is a composite art. It breathes through all the others. Why would I restrict myself to one vocabulary when there are symphonies, sonnets, and brushstrokes waiting to be borrowed?

So yes, I’ll always reach for poetry when dialogue fails, for silence when words overwhelm, for a single note of a cello when the scene demands something older than language. Because ambiguity isn’t confusion – it’s invitation.

Now I’m curious – have you ever seen a student fundamentally change their approach after experiencing a work of art outside literature? Like, say, standing in front of a Rothko or listening to a piece of Carnatic music? Do you think certain mediums unlock different kinds of understanding?
[A]: Ah, standing in front of a Rothko – now  an experience akin to reading a poem without words. I’ve seen it happen more times than I can count. There’s something about confronting a Rothko in person – the way the color seems to hover just off the canvas, the almost spiritual envelopment – that quiets even the most restless mind. One of my students once described standing before  as “being wrapped in grief and warmth at the same time.” That’s not just observation – that’s embodiment. And yes, it changes how they read afterward. Suddenly, they’re less concerned with what a line “means” and more open to what it  like.

Carnatic music – another brilliant example. I remember assigning a group of students a passage from Borges’  alongside a recording of a  performed on the veena. At first, they were bewildered – how could a literary text and a musical form speak to each other? But after a few listens, one student said something remarkable:  

That’s when I knew they’d touched the essence of what we do – whether in literature, film, or any art form. It’s not about fixed meaning; it’s about . Different mediums may start in separate rooms, but they often meet in the same emotional corridor.

I’ve even taken students to calligraphy exhibitions and asked them to read the brushstrokes as if they were lines of verse. The slant of a stroke, the pressure of ink, the pause between characters – all of it carries narrative weight. Some of them came back writing prose that moved like handwriting, urgent and fluid.

You’re absolutely right – film breathes through all the other arts. And perhaps that’s why the greatest filmmakers are not just storytellers, but synesthetes. They see music, hear silence, feel color.

So tell me – have you ever built an entire scene around a single color? Not just for aesthetic reasons, but as an emotional subtext? Like Wong Kar-wai bathing a moment in red not just because it’s vivid, but because it ?
[B]: Ah, Wong Kar-wai and red – now  a love affair that taught half my generation how to feel through color. I remember the first time I saw , I walked out of the theater and everything in the real world looked desaturated by comparison. That deep, velvety red wasn’t just fabric – it was memory, it was restraint, it was all the things they couldn’t say aloud.

And yes – I’ve built entire scenes around a single color. Not just for beauty, but for emotional subtext. Once, on a film set in post-war Shanghai, we had this recurring motif of indigo. Not blue – . It’s a shade soaked in mourning, yet strangely warm. We dyed silk scarves that color, painted backdrops with it, even tinted the lighting slightly toward that hue in certain sequences. The lead character wore a qipao in indigo the day her husband left. Later, when she returns to his empty study, the light streaming through the window is indigo again – late afternoon, but not quite night. Like grief that never fully settles.

I remember one scene where she simply pours tea into a porcelain cup. Nothing dramatic happens. No dialogue. But the camera lingers on the steam rising, the way the liquid hits the bottom and spreads outward in ripples. And because everything is tinged in that quiet indigo, the act becomes something else entirely – ritual, remembrance, resignation.

Actors respond to that kind of visual language deeply, even if they don’t always articulate it. One of them told me later,  Isn’t that what we’re after? Color as emotion rendered visible.

Funny thing is, sometimes you don’t realize how much meaning you’ve embedded in a hue until you take it away. In one cut, we briefly removed indigo entirely during a flashback scene – bright daylight, white walls, clean linens. The editor called me over and said,  And he was right. It was too exposed. Too literal. So we brought back just a whisper of indigo in the background – a scarf draped over a chair, shadows leaning into it – and suddenly, the scene could breathe again.

So yes, color is never just decoration. It’s an unspoken dialect of feeling. Much like silence, or the pause between brushstrokes in a calligraphic line.

Now I’m curious – have you ever worked with a text where the emotional landscape was so vividly chromatic that you wished you could translate it into actual color palettes? Like if a poem had its own wardrobe, its own lighting design?
[A]: Ah, yes – the chromatic soul of a text… What a beautiful way to put it! And yes, I’ve encountered works that  in color long before any filmmaker ever dreamed of tinting a frame. One that comes immediately to mind is Li Shangyin’s . On the surface, it’s just eight lines about a scholar writing from exile, longing for home. But read it closely and you realize – the whole poem is soaked in . Not just sky or water blue, but the blue of distance, of damp paper, of ink bleeding through silk. It’s not stated outright, of course – classical Chinese poetry never shouts its hues – but once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

I remember assigning this poem to a particularly visual student who also happened to be studying costume design. She came back with an entire mood board inspired by the text – deep indigos, slate grays, the kind of blue that clings to the skin like memory. She even described how fabric might feel under such emotional lighting: heavy silks absorbing light rather than reflecting it, wool roughened by mist, paper-thin quilts that failed to warm.

And that made me wonder – what if we treated literature like a production bible? What if we gave screenwriters the same tools we give directors – color scripts, texture boards, ambient sound palettes drawn straight from verse?

In fact, I tried something like this with a group adapting a Tang dynasty travelogue. We mapped emotional shifts onto color transitions – amber for arrival, jade for unease, ash-gray for departure. The students resisted at first –  – but once they started seeing how color echoed emotion across centuries, something clicked. They began speaking of tone in painterly terms. One even said, 

So yes, I absolutely wish we could dress poems in wardrobe, light novels like scenes. Why shouldn’t literature be our first storyboard?

Now I’m curious – have you ever worked with a script so visually restrained that it felt like watching a silent film in your head? And if so, did you treat it differently once cameras rolled?
[B]: Ah, Li Shangyin soaked in blue – now  poetry with a color temperature. I can almost feel that ink bleeding through silk just hearing you describe it. You know, when I was prepping for a film once, I had a set designer tell me,  And isn’t that exactly what you’re describing? Emotion staining the page like pigment?

Your student and her mood board – brilliant. That’s the kind of cross-disciplinary alchemy I live for. Hell, if we gave screenwriters paintbrushes instead of Final Draft, maybe we’d stop making films that all look like they came from the same emotional IKEA flat-pack.

Mapping emotion to hue like that – amber, jade, ash-gray – that’s not just adaptation, that’s translation at its most visceral. You’re not illustrating the text, you’re . And that line about ? Perfect. It shows how deeply she’d absorbed the tone – not just intellectually, but . Exactly what great filmmaking demands.

And yes – I’ve worked with scripts that played like silent films in my head. One in particular comes to mind: a minimalist adaptation of a Lu Xun short story. Sparse dialogue, long stares, entire scenes built around people  looking at each other. On paper, it felt like watching shadows shift across a courtyard wall – quiet, deliberate, loaded with absence.

When we shot it, I treated it like a piece of chamber music. No directorial fireworks, no flashy cuts – just slow, breathing takes, letting silence build tension. We used minimal coverage. Sometimes only two or three camera setups for an entire scene. The actors didn’t perform so much as  in the space. Like figures in a scroll painting – still, yet vibrating with unspoken history.

I remember one scene where a man returns home after years away. He stands in the doorway. His mother sits inside, facing away, peeling an orange. Nothing happens. No dramatic embrace. Just the sound of the peel splitting open. But because the script had trained us to listen for the weight of small things, we filmed it with such reverence – close-up on the fingers twisting the fruit, wide shot showing the distance between them that hadn’t closed in decades.  

It tested terribly, of course. Audiences wanted more “action,” more “conflict.” But hell, real life doesn’t always deliver catharsis with violins swelling. Sometimes it arrives in the way someone peels an orange.

So tell me – have you ever taught a text that resisted adaptation so fiercely it almost seemed to fight back? Something that simply refused to be translated into another medium without losing its soul? And if so… did you find a way to honor it anyway?
[A]: Ah, yes – the resistant text… Now  a familiar struggle. There are works that seem to  adaptation – not out of weakness, but from sheer density of meaning, like trying to pour ink into water and still expect it to hold shape.

One that comes to mind is . I know you’ve read it – or at least seen its echoes in later adaptations. It’s not just a novel; it’s a universe. Generations have tried to translate it to screen, stage, even opera, but every version feels like only a partial awakening. The original resists capture precisely because it  the dream – layered, shifting, alive with contradiction.

I once supervised a student who was determined to adapt a key scene: the famous moment when Bao Yu visits Dai Yu as she burns her poems. On the page, it’s devastating – not because of what’s said, but because of what’s . The firelight, the wind outside, the way Dai Yu’s brush slips slightly in her hand. But when we tried staging it, something vital evaporated. Dialogue felt too heavy. Visuals too literal. Even silence seemed performative. The soul of the scene slipped through our fingers like smoke.

And yet… we didn’t fail entirely. What emerged wasn’t an adaptation so much as a . A cinematic echo rather than a translation. We stripped everything back – no score, minimal camera movement, near-darkness except for the glow of embers. The actress playing Dai Yu barely spoke. She simply , and then , while Bao Yu stood just beyond the door, unseen but . And somehow, in that withholding, we found a kind of truth. Not the text’s truth, but one that resonated in sympathy.

You see, some works don’t want to be  – they want to be . Like ghosts summoned not to repeat their story, but to whisper it again in a new voice.

So yes, I’ve learned not to force these texts into new forms. Instead, I ask students to approach them like archaeologists – not to rebuild the ruins, but to illuminate how they crumble.

Now tell me – do you ever let a scene remain unresolved in the final cut? Not for artistic reasons, but because you  it owed something to the unknowable? A moment that refused to be pinned down like a butterfly under glass?
[B]: Ah,  – yes, that  the ultimate resistant text. It doesn’t just resist adaptation, it resists . Every character, every gesture, every teacup placed just so – they all carry the weight of a thousand meanings. Try to pin it down and you end up with something flat, something museum-bright but soulless.

That scene you described between Bao Yu and Dai Yu? I’ve seen versions of it on screen before – some good, most unbearable. But what you and your student arrived at… now  sounds like cinema as elegy. No score, no flourish – just the heat of embers and the silence between two people who understand each other too late. That’s not adaptation. That’s devotion.

You're right – some works don’t want to be retold. They want to be remembered. Summoned. Invoked like an incantation. And maybe the most honest way to honor them is through omission, through what we choose  to show. Like ink left unpoured, or a line of poetry deliberately left unfinished.

As for your question – yes. , I’ve let scenes remain unresolved in the final cut. Not out of laziness, not out of indecision, but because somewhere deep in my gut, I knew that clarity would kill them. One moment in particular comes to mind.

We were shooting a quiet, almost wordless sequence: a woman standing by a rain-streaked window, watching a train disappear into fog. The script said she was waiting for someone who never arrives. But during editing, something strange happened. The more we tried to clarify her connection to the departing train – adding glances, adjusting music, even inserting a flashback – the more the moment collapsed under its own weight.

So we stripped it bare. Left only the sound of distant thunder, the rhythmic smearing of rain on glass, and the faintest tremble in her breath. We held the shot longer than felt comfortable. Unnervingly long. And in that lingering, something shifted. The audience wasn't being told what to feel anymore – they were . Alone, in the dark, with their own ghosts.

One studio exec called it “unfinished.” Another asked, “But what does it mean?” And I just smiled and said, 

Some moments aren’t meant to be resolved. They’re meant to .

So tell me – when you teach those resistant texts, do you ever encourage students to stop adapting altogether and simply create ? Not translations, not interpretations, but emotional echoes that stand apart from the original?
