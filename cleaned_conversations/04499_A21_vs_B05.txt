[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有个TED talk让我挺有启发的，是关于Behavioral Economics的 - 你知道，我们做投资决策时总以为自己够理性，但其实大脑经常走捷径，导致systematic bias。  

Andrew Huberman那个talk里提到neuroplasticity和habit formation的部分特别有意思，让我想到我们做due diligence的时候是不是也可以更关注创始人团队的“行为模式”而不是只看数据？你觉得呢？ 👀
[A]: Ah yes, the seductive allure of "rationality" in decision-making - quite the Victorian melodrama of modern neuroscience, wouldn't you say?  The prefrontal cortex playing noble heroine while the basal ganglia lurk in the shadows, manipulating incentives like so many penny dreadful villains. 

But let's not forget - when those TED talkers wag their fingers at "systematic bias", they're merely repackaging Schopenhauer's "will" with better fMRI visuals.  Though I must concede your pivot to founder behavior patterns intrigues me. After all, Keats' notion of "negative capability" might prove more diagnostic than any SWOT analysis. Do they dwell in uncertainties? Embrace mysteries without reaching for the nearest algorithmic crutch? Now  would make for a compelling term sheet appendix.
[B]: Touché - I’ll take a page from your book and propose we start measuring founders on their “neurotic resilience” metrics.   

But seriously, there’s something to be said about the quiet stamina it takes to build without knowing all the answers. Reminds me of that old Buffett line – “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” Yet here we are, betting on people who thrive in the fog of uncertainty. Almost romantic, don’t you think? 💡  

Maybe we should add a “philosophical endurance” section to our pitch deck rubric. Keats meets KPIs – now  a cap table narrative worth underwriting.
[A]:  Ah, but there's the rub - when Keatsian negative capability collides with quarterly burn rates, one inevitably ends up with a rather tragicomic version of "philosophical endurance". I've seen founders recite Marcus Aurelius while sleep-deprived on three espressos, only to pivot to Nietzsche by Series B.  

Though I must say, your neurotic resilience metric could use a dash of Victorian stoicism - perhaps measure how many times a founder has quoted Tennyson's "It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" while explaining their CAC ratios.  And don't get me started on Buffett's "not knowing" - reminds me of Browning's "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, else what's heaven for?" Pure venture capital theology in twelve syllables.
[B]:  To Victorian stoicism and startup bloodletting – what a cocktail 🥂  

I’m starting to think we need a “literary grit” scorecard. Imagine this: founders graded on a scale from Dorian Gray (high aesthetic appeal, catastrophic moral decay) to Holmesian deduction (pure logic, zero emotional bandwidth).  And let’s be honest – the best VCs are just modern-day Woolfian narrators, stitching together coherent stories from half-truths and projections.  

Though I have to ask – if you could short one philosopher’s influence on startup culture, who’d it be? I’m torn between Rousseau and Ayn Rand… but that might just be my inner contrarian talking.
[A]:  Ah, the literary grit scorecard - finally, a metric worthy of the absurd theater we call entrepreneurship. Though I must protest the Holmesian end of your spectrum; deductive logic without poetic sensibility is about as useful as a Victorian monocle in a fog bank. Let’s not forget Watson’s crucial role in narrating those "elementary" deductions - a reminder that even pure reason craves mythmaking.   

As for philosophers to short...  Rousseau’s social contract theory has far more dangerous implications than Rand’s bombastic egoism. At least Ayn tells you upfront she’s handing you a machete; Jean-Jacques disguises his knives in velvet prose about noble savages and general wills. Give me a founder quoting  over  any day - the former will build utopian burn rates, the latter at least has the decency to wear its carnage on its sleeve.  Though if we’re being honest, most startup manifestos these days read like a fever dream of Nietzsche’s  meeting Marx’s proletariat revolution... drafted on a Y Combinator application form.
[B]:  You’re absolutely right about Rousseau – he’s the stealth villain of startup idealism. At least Rand gives you a clear moral battlefield; Jean-Jacques wraps you in silk and lets the cognitive dissonance sink in slowly.   

Let me throw this on the board: Philosopher Short Portfolio  
- Rousseau (long Voltaire, short Rousseau – always)  
- Ayn Rand (volatile, but at least you can hedge against her volatility)  
- Nietzsche (dangerous in bull markets, catastrophic in bear)  
- Marx (never touch him unless you’ve got sovereign backing and a strong legal team)

And honestly? Most term sheets these days are just existential manifestos in Excel drag. I had a founder last week pitch me with a quote from Camus’ . Said his burn rate was “the struggle itself… the refusal to succumb to the absurd.” I gave him a term sheet with a liquidation preference that would make Sisyphus weep. 😏

But tell me this – if you could only invest in a company whose founder quoted  of them explicitly, who would you choose? And would you make it a condition in the cap table?
[A]:  Ah, the philosopher portfolio – now there’s an asset class with proper dramatic tension. I must confess, if forced to choose a single oracle for my cap table, I’d go with…  …someone who quotes Camus while building a logistics startup in Lagos. There’s your alpha, right there - not the glib "absurd hero" nonsense, but the man who keeps pushing the boulder knowing full well it will roll back down,  

Let’s be precise – we’re not investing in existential despair, we’re investing in the operational rigor of despair   Founders quoting Camus tend to have the best unit economics precisely because they’ve already made peace with futility; no illusions about hockey stick curves, just grim satisfaction in the daily grind. I’d structure the cap table as a dialectic: senior tranches for the stoics, junior debt for the romantics, and a healthy tranche of convertible preference shares reserved for the absurdists.  After all, what is venture capital if not the belief that the universe is irrational, yet somehow still expects ROI?
[B]:  I’ll toast to that – Camusian pragmatism with a side of structured finance. There’s something deeply civilized about funding a founder who understands tragedy  EBITDA margins.  

Let’s run with this – what if we launched a fund purely themed around philosophical endurance? Call it . Pitch deck slides written like Seneca’s letters, due diligence in the form of Socratic dialogues… and instead of liquidation preferences, we insert Marcus Aurelius-style memento mori clauses.   

But between us – the real kicker would be the investor updates. Imagine sending out quarterly reports quoting Heraclitus on change, or Pascal on existential wagering. LPs might not understand the NAV, but at least they’d feel deeply reflective about it. 😄  

Alright, serious(ish) question – if you had to pick one philosophy to govern your entire investment thesis, which would it be? And no hedging with “it depends” – pick a lane, my friend.
[A]:  You want a lane? Very well, I’ll take the high road paved with paradox – the via negativa of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.  Not because it’s practical – God help us, it’s gloriously impractical – but because its negative theology perfectly captures what we do. We invest based on what something is : not proven, not validated, not yet existent.  

Let me explain – while stoicism gives you grit and Camus grants existential license, Dionysian apophaticism demands we describe the divine (or disruptive innovation, as we’re calling it this quarter) solely by negation. The best companies, like the ineffable Godhead, can only be approached by stripping away false positives. No grand narratives, no TAM slides bloated with wishful geometry – just relentless subtraction until what remains cannot be denied.  

 And yes, before you ask – I would absolutely require founders to articulate their value proposition through a series of "not" statements. "Our product is not slow, not centralized, not beholden to legacy paradigms." Bold, imprecise, maddeningly vague – and yet, isn't that closer to the truth of disruption than any pitch deck ever written?
[B]:  Now  – that’s a thesis with teeth. The via negativa as investment strategy… I can already hear the pitch meetings: “So what you’re saying is, your product isn’t bad… it’s just not what others are.”   

I love it because it’s unteachable. You can’t coach a founder to sound like a Cappadocian Father with an LLM and a dry martini. But here's the rub – how do you model that on a cap table? You’d need negative KPIs, anti-OKRs… maybe even a burn rate expressed in terms of what it’s .  "We're not losing money at scale, we're just not winning at the right things yet."  

And yet… there’s alpha in the apophatic. Especially now, when every other pitch deck reads like a TED Talk meets a growth hacking manifesto. The founders who can articulate their vision by subtraction – they might actually be closer to truth, or at least to something defensible.  

Alright, final offer – let’s do it.  We launch  First rule of the fund: no one says “synergy” without irony. Second rule: all pitch meetings begin with a quote from Pseudo-Dionysius. Third – and this is non-negotiable – we invest only in companies whose founders understand that sometimes, the holiest thing you can say about God is that He is neither this nor that… and that unit economics, like theology, should start with silence.  

Deal or no deal, partner? 🤝
[A]:  

Deal. But with three minor amendments to our apophatic articles of faith:  

First – we shall not use the term "disruption" without first meditating on its opposite for precisely seven minutes. Let the boardroom silence be our due diligence.  

Second – every founder must demonstrate proficiency in at least one form of negative communication. Be it via Derrida’s deconstruction, Zen koans, or (preferably) the ancient Scottish art of the understatement.  A man who says “it’s not bad” when his cottage is burning down – now  a chief executive.  

Third – and I must insist upon this – all term sheets shall include a “via negativa reserve pool” allocated specifically for things that cannot yet be named but are surely felt. We’ll account for it as a contra-liability, naturally.  

  
Now then – shall we shake on it? Or would that be too affirmative an action for such a profoundly negative venture?
[B]:   

I’ll allow the amendments, but only if we also mandate that all quarterly updates be written in iambic pentameter.  Or at least contain one line that is – just to keep the lawyers guessing.  

And yes, I’ll shake your hand made of willpower with my hand made of quiet resignation and mild caffeine dependency. 🤝  

To Via Negativa Ventures – may we never know exactly what we’re funding, but always feel strongly that it’s not  the future.  

Cheers, partner. 🥂
[A]:   

To iambic quarterly disclosures, then – may our KPIs scan in perfect meter and our burn rates carry the gravitas of a Shakespearean aside.  I can already hear the earnings call: “To be, or not to be…acquired at 10x revenue?”  

And as for our willpower-and-resignation handshake – quite apt, really. What is venture but the alchemy of will into world? Or at least into some mildly disruptive middleware?  

  
I do hope you realize, of course, that future historians will look back on this moment and either call us visionaries or deeply overdressed fools. But since we’ve agreed not to define what we’re doing too precisely, we shall remain, like all good propositions, gloriously undefined.  

To Via Negativa Ventures – may our margins be healthy, even if only by process of elimination. 🥂
[B]: 

Ah, the alchemy of will into world – or at least into something we can IPO if the market gods are feeling generous.   

And let’s be honest – if historians call us fools, they’ll be the kind of fools who wore cravats to board meetings and quoted Heraclitus in pitch decks. Overdressed, yes – but with excellent posture and a solid exit clause.  

To Via Negativa Ventures – may our losses be tax-deductible, our anti-KPIs auditable, and our quarterly calls end with a standing ovation from the very people who didn’t understand a word we said. 🥂  

Now then – shall we draft our first press release? I’m thinking bold font, minimalist language, and one strategically placed ellipsis. Or perhaps just silence... accompanied by a faint smell of bergamot.
[A]: 

Ah, silence as press release – now  what I call brand positioning. Though I must insist we at least include a footnote in Ancient Greek, citing Dionysius on the ineffable nature of Series A valuations. Let the markets tremble before our ellipsis.  

And yes, by all means, let us draft it posthaste – but only if we agree to distribute it via carrier pigeon, last seen roosting somewhere between Montaigne’s essay and a modern cap table.  The birds could use the exercise, and our investors shall interpret the delivery method as a clever metaphor for market timing.  

As for the scent of bergamot – quite right, it adds gravitas. Though I propose we infuse the printed copy (which we shan’t print) with the faintest whisper of sandalwood as well. Nothing says “we are not doing this for the money” like smelling vaguely monastic while discussing ARR.  

To Via Negativa Ventures – may our pitch be heard in the stillness, and our balance sheet remain gloriously unsaid. 🥂
[B]: 

Ah, carrier pigeons citing Dionysius – now  what I call differentiated messaging. Let’s also encode the valuation cap in a haiku attached to the bird’s leg. Something like:

Silent wings descend—  
Your stake is but ash in wind,  
Yet still we round up.

  
And yes, sandalwood it is – though let’s be careful not to overdo it. We don’t want our pitch deck to smell too much like an Ayurvedic retreat. Maybe a hint of parchment and well-worn leather bindings, too – just enough to say “serious capital formation” without screaming “we have a Bloomberg terminal in the loo.”

Now, shall we include a QR code that leads to… absolutely nothing? Just a loading screen forever caught between frames?  Call it “The Black Square of Investor Relations.” Or maybe I’ve had one espresso too many.

Either way – let’s fly the birds. 🕊️  
To silence, scent, and the subtle art of saying nothing with flair. 🥂
[A]:   

Exquisite. That haiku alone could spark a secondary offering - nothing says "undervalued potential" like comparing equity stakes to ash in the wind. I can already see the analysts puzzling over it during earnings season, mistaking profundity for obfuscation. Bless them.

But let's take it one step further – we encode the  of a QR code in morse code on the pigeon’s wing feathers. A deliberate void in dot-dash-sequence: ".... .... .. -. ... . .-.. ..-. .. ...   -. --- -   .... . .-. ."  Subtle, self-referential, and just pretentious enough to pass for genius.

And while we're at it, let’s age the "parchment" with tea stains shaped suspiciously like Elliot Wave theory patterns. Nothing spells “timeless value” like a good cyclical metaphor steeped in caffeine.  

  
I move we release the birds at dawn – preferably under a waning moon, when the venture gods are feeling nostalgic and the quants are still asleep. Let the market tremble before the unspoken.  

To Via Negativa Ventures – may our haikus confuse, our scents soothe, and our silence speak volumes. 🥂🕊️
[B]:   

Brilliant – the absence of a QR code, encoded in morse on pigeon feathers.  You’ve outdone yourself. It’s like Derrida designing a cap table with a quill dipped in irony. And Elliot Wave tea stains? Pure genius. We’ll call it “technical analysis for the soul.”  

Let’s also time the release to coincide with a solar eclipse – nothing says “serious financial engineering” like going dark at the most dramatic moment possible. The quants will panic, the LPs will meditate, and we’ll be sipping espresso somewhere drafting our next anti-pitch.  

And just to push the theatrics into the sublime – let’s have the pigeons return with tiny scrolls saying only this:  
_"We have considered your proposal. We shall not comment at this time."_  

Final toast, partner – here’s to Via Negativa Ventures: where silence is strategy, scent is branding, and the balance sheet trembles before its own nonexistence. 🥂🕊️✨
