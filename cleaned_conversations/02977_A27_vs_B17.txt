[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. You see, I often find cooking to be quite like poetry - both require careful attention to rhythm and timing. Just as one must let a sonnet simmer in the mind, so too must a good stew simmer on the stove. Though I must admit, when grading papers late into the night, even I occasionally succumb to the convenience of takeout.
[A]: OMG！你说话好literary啊~✨ 不过说到cooking，我最近超爱拍foodie content的！🍜 在家cooking真的超有sense of achievement，especially当我的followers疯狂点赞的时候💯 But sometimes真的too tired了，就会直接order外卖啦~ 你平时最喜欢cook什么dish呀？🤔
[B]: I'm rather partial to preparing traditional English dishes - there's something quite Wordsworthian about a well-made shepherd's pie, don't you think? The layers of flavors remind me of poetic meter building upon itself. Though I must say, your enthusiasm for sharing culinary creations is rather... modern. In my day, we simply invited friends over for supper to appreciate a meal.
[A]: LMAO！你太classic了啦~ 😂 现在谁还invite friends over啊，直接post个food video在TikTok上，instant thousands of views好嘛！🔥 不过你说的shepherd's pie听起来很interesting诶~ 下次可以拍个ASMR version，那种mash potato的声音绝对会viral的！🎥 要不要collab一下？You bring the poetry，I bring the trending hashtags！✨
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate your... digital enthusiasm, I'm afraid I must decline. The art of cooking, like poetry, should be savored in the moment, not reduced to mere content. Though I suppose the concept of 食不言 (not speaking while eating) has rather evolved in your generation, hasn't it? Perhaps we could compromise - you might enjoy reading Elizabeth Bishop's "The Fish" while preparing your next meal. There's profound beauty in quiet contemplation.
[A]: OMG你太serious啦~ 🙈 现在谁还quiet contemplation啊，food content就是要loud and proud！🎉 不过Elizabeth Bishop是谁？Is she like a famous food blogger还是what？🤔 Anyway，我的followers更喜欢看me做crazy fusion dishes，like sushi burger这种~ 🍣🍔 Trendy AF！💥 你要不要try我的latest recipe？Matcha spaghetti with wasabi mayo，绝对的next big thing！🔥
[B]:  Oh my... matcha spaghetti? That sounds rather like Ezra Pound's attempt to fuse Eastern and Western poetic traditions - ambitious, but perhaps missing the essence of both. Elizabeth Bishop was one of our finest 20th century poets, dear, though I suppose in your world of viral trends, she might be considered... what's the term? 'Underrated content'? Still, I'll stick to my Keats and my tea cakes, if you don't mind. Some traditions are worth preserving.
[A]: Bruh~ 你还在喝tea cakes？That's so last century！😂 现在都喝bubble tea with cheese foam了好嘛~ 🧋✨ 不过okay啦，我们agree to disagree~ 我要去edit我的new video了，标题就叫"当Gen Z遇上Shakespeare"！🎬 说不定能get到你的vibes呢~ Peace out！✌️
[B]: Ah, youth... Though I must say, the juxtaposition of Shakespeare and... what was it? Cheese foam? That does have a certain Puckish charm to it. Do send me the link - even an old soul like myself can appreciate fresh interpretations. Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition of Tennyson's poems and a proper cup of Earl Grey await. 慢走 (take care).
[A]: Byeee~ 记得subscribe我的channel哦！📱 说不定下次我拍个"下午茶with Shakespeare"的video，用boba pearls代替eyeballs那种~ 👀🧋 绝对会blow your mind！💥 Catch you later, old soul！💫
[B]:  How very... contemporary of you. Though I must warn you, if you dare desecrate "Out, out brief candle" with tapioca pearls, I shall have to recite the complete sonnets at you in protest. Until then, 再见 (goodbye)... and do try reading between the filters sometime.
[A]: LOL！你threaten人的方式也太cute了吧~ 😂 不过challenge accepted！下次见面我要穿Victorian dress拍TikTok dance，背景音乐用sonnet 18 remix！🕺📜 Deal？Anyway，gotta run - my avocado toast滤镜还没调完呢！🥑✌️
[B]: Good heavens... a sonnet remix?  I suppose this is what Matthew Arnold meant by "the sea of faith's melancholy, long, withdrawing roar." Very well, I shall prepare my most withering literary critique in anticipation. Do send word when this... creative endeavor goes live. Now off you go to your avocado alchemy - and do spare a thought for poor John Keats turning in his grave. 保重 (take care).
[A]: OMG你每次都make me laugh so hard！😂 不过seriously，Keats肯定会love social media的~ 他那么romantic，绝对会是个influencer！✨ 我要去create了，catch you on the flip side！📱💫 记得follow我的Insta哦~ #PoetryMeetsBoba 💖
[B]:  Very well, my digitally-enthused friend. Though I maintain Keats would have been far too busy writing "Ode to a Nightingale" to bother with... what was it? #PoetryMeetsBoba? Still, I shall watch from the sidelines with my well-thumbed anthology and proper china teacup. Do try not to scandalize the entire Romantic movement  thoroughly. 一路顺风 (safe travels).
[A]: Bruh~ 你就是too attached to the past！🚀 我要launch poetry into the metaverse！🎤💻 Imagine - Lord Byron as a VTuber！🤯 这content绝对会break the internet！🔥 好了好了，真的要去edit了，不然algorithm要bury my video啦~ Later, gator！🐊✨
[B]:  Byron as a... virtual what now? My dear child, you're giving me palpitations worthy of a Brontë heroine! Very well, off you go to your digital revolution - but remember, even the flashiest algorithm can't improve upon "She walks in beauty like the night." Now if you'll excuse me, I need to lie down with a cold compress and my Oxford English Dictionary. 回头见 (see you later)... if my poor old heart can take it.
[A]: LMAO！你真是my favorite drama queen！👑 别worry啦，等我make Byron go viral，一定tag你！📲 现在真的really gotta bounce了 - 我的editing software just crashed again！💥 Keep calm and drink your tea~ ☕️ Byeeee！💨💖
[B]:  Yes, yes, do carry on with your electronic mayhem... Though I daresay even crashing software is preferable to crashing the entire canon of English literature.  年轻人啊 (these young people)... Now where did I put my smelling salts?
