[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite the intriguing question! I must say, the universe is so vast and full of mysteries that it's hard not to wonder about life beyond our planet. While I don't have any personal encounters to share, I've heard some fascinating stories from travelers who stay at the hotel. It always makes for an interesting conversation over breakfast! What about you? Have you ever had any experiences that made you think there might be something out there?
[A]: You know, I’ve always thought the universe is like a giant coffee cup—there’s so much room for surprises ☕️! Some of my customers who travel a lot have shared wild stories about seeing UFOs in places like Peru & Japan. While I can’t say I’ve seen anything myself, I do find it fascinating how people describe their experiences~ Have you ever been to any place that made you feel like something  could be around the corner? 🌌
[B]: Oh, I simply adore that coffee cup analogy! ☕ There's something so comforting about the idea that the universe still has room for mystery and magic. Speaking of which, you've just reminded me of a rather peculiar experience I had while traveling through the Scottish Highlands several years ago. Now, I wouldn't exactly call it otherworldly, but... let's just say the locals spoke of "the thin places," where the veil between worlds feels almost tangible. I stayed in a tiny village surrounded by ancient standing stones, and some mornings, I'd wake up with the strangest feeling that something—well, not quite explainable—was lingering just beyond sight. It was eerily peaceful, really.  
But tell me, since you hear so many stories from your customers, have any of them shared details that particularly stood out to you? The kind that made you think, ? 🌌✨
[A]: That sounds absolutely magical~ 🌿 The idea of "thin places" really resonates with me, like those moments when you sip a perfectly brewed cup and everything just feels... aligned. I’ve had customers describe similar feelings while traveling in places like Sedona & Tibet—like the earth itself hums beneath your feet if you stay long enough to listen.  

One story that stuck with me was from a traveler who stayed in a remote village in Ireland. She told me about walking through a misty valley at dawn and suddenly feeling this overwhelming sense of being watched—not in a scary way, but more like… being  by something ancient and kind. She said the air got still, and then she heard what sounded like whispering in a language no one could recognize. When she asked locals about it later, they simply nodded and said,   

I mean, how do you explain that? Coincidence? Folklore? Or maybe... a glimpse into something just beyond our everyday reality? 🌌✨ What do you think made you feel that way in the Highlands?
[B]: That’s an absolutely beautiful way to put it— I’ve always thought that certain places carry a sort of memory in the land itself, like echoes of time that we only occasionally tune into. And the fact that the locals in Ireland had a name for it? That adds such a rich layer of meaning—it's not just a fleeting feeling, but part of a shared human experience across generations.  

As for what I felt in the Highlands… well, I suppose it was a mix of atmosphere and energy. The landscape there is so dramatic—rolling moors, stone circles weathered by centuries, ruins that whisper stories if you lean in close enough. But more than that, I think it was the silence. Not just the absence of noise, but a presence within the quiet, if that makes any sense. It made me hyper-aware of my own breath, my heartbeat, almost like I was sharing the space with something unseen but deeply rooted in that land.  

It makes me wonder—do you think these experiences are tied to place, or to the people who are open enough to notice them? Or maybe it's both? 🌿✨
[A]: I couldn’t agree more—sometimes silence isn't empty at all; it's , like a held breath waiting for the next note in a melody 🎶. You put that feeling into words so beautifully. I think it  both—place & the people who slow down enough to feel it.  

Think about it: we walk into a space and assume it’s just walls or landscape, but what if some places are like coffee beans? They hold the history of where they're from—the soil, the rain, the altitude. And when you roast them just right, you can taste that story. Maybe certain landscapes do the same thing—they store energy, memory, even spirit.  

And then there are those people who are naturally more sensitive to it, like having a finer grinder for life’s flavors ☕️. Not that others don’t experience it, but they might not recognize it for what it is.  

Honestly though, the fact that these moments exist—that we can feel connected to something older than ourselves—is kind of magic in itself, right? Do you think you'd ever go back to that village in the Highlands? Or maybe you're already planning your next  adventure? ✨✈️
[B]: That’s such a poetic way to think about it—places as storytellers, and people as the ones who choose whether or not to listen. I love that analogy with coffee beans; it's true, some experiences need the right conditions to truly reveal their depth. And sensitivity really does act like a fine grinder—it helps us savor those subtle notes we might otherwise miss in the rush of daily life.  

You know, since you mentioned it, I  been thinking about returning to the Highlands… perhaps when the heather is in bloom this summer. There was something so grounding yet ethereal about being there, and I’d love to give myself the chance to feel that stillness again—with a bit more time to simply be present. But now I’m curious—do you have a place that calls to you like that? Somewhere you feel drawn back to, no matter how many times you visit? ✨🌿
[A]: Oh, I love that—… I might have to write that down & roast it into my next batch of beans ☕️. There’s definitely something to returning to a place that feels like an old friend, you know?  

As a matter of fact, there  a spot that keeps pulling me back—Kyoto, especially during the autumn leaves. Every time I go, it feels like stepping into a quiet poem written in golds & reds. I stay in this tiny ryokan near the foot of Mount Kurama, where the air smells like moss & incense, and the mornings begin with the distant bell of a temple. It’s not just beautiful—it’s , like your soul exhales for the first time in months.  

Maybe it’s the tea ceremonies, or the way light filters through paper screens, but every visit feels like coming home to a version of myself I almost forget exists. I keep telling myself I’ll spend a whole season there one year, no rush, just… presence. Like brewing a slow pourover—worth every extra second.  

Now that I think about it, maybe that’s what “thin places” really are—where time dilutes and lets you taste the essence of life in its purest form 🌿✨. Have you ever experienced something like that while traveling? A place that didn’t just impress you, but somehow… changed your inner landscape?
[B]: That sounds absolutely dreamlike—Kyoto in autumn must feel like stepping into a watercolor painting. I can almost smell the crisp air, the moss-covered stones, the faint trace of incense curling through morning light… how utterly serene 🌿✨. And your description of it as a place where —oh, that’s perfect. It’s not just about beauty, is it? It’s about presence. About being gently reminded who you are when the noise fades away.

Funny you should ask if I’ve felt that elsewhere—I think I have. There was a moment in Marrakech, of all places, that stayed with me. Not in the bustling souks or grand palaces, but in a small courtyard garden tucked behind a centuries-old riad. The scent of orange blossoms hung in the air, fountains whispered stories in Arabic I couldn’t understand, and the light had this golden hush, like the world was holding its breath. I remember sitting there for what felt like hours—though it was probably only twenty minutes—and realizing how much I’d been carrying with me without even noticing. That place didn’t just quiet the outside; it quieted something  me.  

Maybe that’s what these special spots do—they don’t just show us the world, they help us re-find ourselves within it. Don’t you think? 🍃☕
[A]: Absolutely—spot on 🌿✨. It’s like some places have this quiet wisdom built into their stones and soil, just waiting for someone to sit still long enough to listen. And I love that you found that in Marrakech—such a vibrant, chaotic city, yet tucked away in a garden, you found this pocket of peace. That’s the thing about travel, right? It surprises you when you least expect it.

I totally agree with you—those spaces don’t just reflect the world back at us, they help us  with something deeper inside. Like a gentle reset button for the soul 🧘‍♂️☕️. Maybe that’s why we remember them so vividly—they weren't just beautiful to look at, but meaningful to .  

Now I’m sitting here thinking… if you could go back to that courtyard in Marrakech tomorrow, or anywhere else that’s held that kind of magic for you, would you? Or is part of the charm how fleeting those moments are—like sipping a perfectly balanced pour-over that only exists for a few minutes before it starts to cool? 😊✨
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought—to return or to let the memory remain just as it is, like that perfect sip of coffee at its peak. You know, I think I’d go back. Not to chase the exact same moment, because you can never truly recreate magic, but to see if the feeling still lingers in the air like incense smoke—faint, but familiar. I’d sit in that courtyard again, maybe with a book in hand and no expectations, just to see what, if anything, would rise up from the silence once more.

And yet… you’re right about the beauty of impermanence. Those fleeting moments are precious precisely because they don’t last forever. They teach us how to be present, don’t they? Remind us to savor what we have while we have it. Much like life itself, really.  

Now I’m curious—are there any places  revisit not to escape, but to remember who you are when the world gets too loud? Or perhaps one that taught you something unexpected about yourself? 🌿✨
[A]: Oh, that’s such a thoughtful question… and honestly? Yes—absolutely. There’s this little coastal town in southern Taiwan called  (車城), where my grandmother used to take me as a kid. It's not on most travel itineraries, but for me, it's full of quiet power. We’d stay in a simple guesthouse made of bamboo and old wood, sleep with the windows open to the sound of cicadas & ocean wind, and wake up to market fishermen selling fresh oysters and papaya milk tea 🌊🥛.

I didn’t realize it then, but going back there as an adult taught me how much of myself I had unknowingly left behind—my connection to simplicity, patience, and the rhythm of nature. In Taipei or Tokyo or even Paris, life moves fast. But there, time feels like slow-dripped coffee: intentional, fragrant, grounding.  

One trip, I ended up helping an elderly fisherman mend his net just because he asked if I knew how. I didn’t—but he taught me anyway, saying,   
(“A young person should learn how to mend things—not just nets, but also the heart.”)  

That line stuck with me. Funny how wisdom sometimes arrives through calloused hands and salty air instead of books 😊✨.  

Do you ever find that? That the most meaningful lessons come from the least expected places—or people?
[B]: That’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve heard in a long while…  Oh, what a gift. There’s something so profound about learning from hands that have spent a lifetime working with care, isn’t there? It feels like receiving a quiet truth wrapped in everyday gestures.

And yes—I couldn’t agree more. Some of the most meaningful lessons I’ve carried with me didn’t come from grand experiences or deep conversations in lofty places, but from fleeting moments with people who simply  what they knew to be true. Like that fisherman in Checheng, or the old woman in Morocco who taught me how to fold mint leaves just right into tea—because, as she said, 

It makes me think… maybe that’s part of what travel is really for—not just to see new places, but to let ourselves be gently unraveled and quietly re-stitched by the hands we meet along the way 🌿☕️.  

Have you been back to Checheng since that conversation with the fisherman? And if so, did you bring anything new to mend—or did you find yourself being mended all over again?
[A]: Funny you ask… I  go back a couple years later, with a bit more wear on my heart & a suitcase full of city stress I didn’t realize I was carrying 😊. And wouldn’t you know it—there he was, same spot by the harbor, still mending nets like time hadn’t moved at all. He barely looked up at first, just handed me a torn piece and said,   
(“You remember how to mend this?”)

I did—not perfectly, but enough to get back into rhythm. And in that quiet act of weaving thread through holes, something in me settled again. I realized I wasn’t there to fix anything new—I was there to be reminded that some things don’t need fixing right away. That healing, like net-mending, is a slow craft. You can’t rush the knots or force the weave. You just have to keep your hands steady and trust the process.

So yeah… I left a little lighter, like I’d been gently re-stitched by the sea breeze and old wisdom 🌿🌊. Makes me wonder—have you ever had a moment like that? Where someone gave you a small task that somehow ended up tending something much bigger inside you?
[B]: Oh, that’s just… . The way you describe it—how the mending became more than just a task, how the rhythm of it brought you back to yourself—it’s like life handed you a quiet teacher in the form of a fishing net. And what a beautiful thing, to be welcomed back like that, as if no time had passed at all. It reminds me so much of something that happened during my very first trip to Italy.

I was staying in a small village outside of Florence, helping out at a family-run vineyard for a few weeks—mostly light work, picking grapes, sweeping the stone porch in the mornings. One day, the matriarch of the house, Nonna Lucia, handed me a basket of figs and simply said,  (“Wash them with care.”) I thought she meant not to bruise them, so I took my time, gently rinsing each one in cool water, laying them out to dry in the sun.

Later that evening, as we sat around the table sharing bread, cheese, and those same figs, she smiled at me and said,  And in that moment, I realized she hadn’t just been teaching me how to wash fruit—she’d been reminding me to treat myself with that same gentle attention. That some parts of us are delicate, and they need patience, not pressure.

It stayed with me. Still does.  

So yes… I know exactly what you mean when you say someone gave you a task only to find your heart was being tended all along 🌿✨. Some people see straight into the quiet places inside us—and offer us a way back in, one careful gesture at a time.
[A]: That’s... honestly, I don’t even know what to say except that it's so beautiful how life teaches us through these soft, unspoken moments 🌿✨. Nonna Lucia sounds like one of those rare souls who carries wisdom in her fingertips—like she didn’t just grow figs, she grew . And you—you were ready to receive it.

I think that’s the thing we often forget: sometimes the most healing thing isn’t a grand gesture or some big revelation—it’s just being asked to do something small, with your full presence. A kind of meditation without calling it one.  

You know, maybe this is why I love coffee so much—it’s the same idea. The way you grind, the water temp, the pour speed… they all seem like little details, but together? They shape the whole experience. Life’s kind of like that too, right? We’re always brewing something, whether we realize it or not ☕️😊.

Say, since you’ve worked with grapes and figs alike—have you ever thought about how certain fruits carry their own kind of soul? Or is that just me being overly romantic about food again? 😄
[B]: Oh, not overly romantic at all—I’d say you’re simply paying attention in the way that truly matters. 🌿✨ Fruits  carry their own kind of soul, don’t they? There’s something deeply personal about them—the way they ripen slowly, with patience, often unseen; how they hold both sweetness and seeds of what could become something more.

Working with grapes in Italy, I noticed how much care goes into each bunch before it ever touches the press. They’re handled like memories—you don’t rush them, you don’t force them. You wait until they’re ready, and even then, you treat them gently, knowing they’ve already lived a full life before they reach your hands.

And figs? Oh, those are something else entirely. So soft, almost vulnerable on the outside, but with such deep, rich flavor hidden inside—like they're guarding secrets beneath their delicate skin. It always felt like a privilege to work with them, as if they trusted me enough to be opened.

You know, now that I think about it, coffee must feel a bit like working with these fruits—each bean carrying its own history, its own terroir. Do you ever roast beans and think, ? ☕🍃

I wonder—have you ever tasted a coffee that reminded you of a place? Or maybe… a person?
[A]: Oh, —so much yes 🌿☕️. Some beans are like postcards from places you’ve never been but somehow still recognize. I remember roasting a batch from Huehuetenango a while back—just a deep, rich roast with this unexpected note of stone fruit & wild honey. As soon as I ground it, I was instantly pulled back to this tiny village in northern Thailand where I once stayed for a week, surrounded by lychee trees and foggy mountain air. It wasn’t the same flavor exactly, but it  like the same place—if that makes sense?

I think coffee does that more than we realize—it carries not just geography, but memory. You taste something and suddenly you're standing barefoot on a sun-warmed deck, or wrapped in the scent of someone’s perfume on a rainy afternoon.  

And people? Oh, absolutely. There’s a customer who used to come in every Sunday morning—always ordered the same Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, always drank it slowly while reading poetry. After she stopped coming in (moved overseas, I think), I couldn’t brew that same bean without thinking of her. Now when I do, I almost feel like she’s sitting here again, quietly turning pages in the corner ☕✨.

Do you think there’s a particular drink—or dish—that holds someone for you? Someone you taste even if only for a second?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—there most certainly is. 🌿✨

Every time I make , that simple Portuguese potato and kale soup, I taste my late grandfather’s hands in the broth. He used to make it every winter, always with a bit too much garlic and just the right amount of smoky chouriço to make the kitchen feel like home. He’d hum old fado songs while chopping, never measure anything, and finish it off with a drizzle of olive oil he swore came from his cousin’s grove near Lisbon.

I didn’t realize how much of  was in that soup until after he was gone. Now, even when I make it exactly as he taught me, I still expect to hear his voice asking if I’ve tasted it yet. Funny how flavor can hold not just memory, but presence. Like love bottled in a bowl.

So yes… I think we all have those dishes—ones that don’t just feed us, but remind us who we are, and who we’ve loved, through the quiet alchemy of taste ☕🍃.

I think I’d like to try that Ethiopian Yirgacheffe sometime—I’d love to see if I could taste the poetry in it, just a little. Would you brew me a cup? 😊
