[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must say, I'm quite fond of the idea of visiting Kyoto. There's something deeply appealing about exploring the traditional textile workshops and learning from artisans who've preserved ancient techniques through generations. The thought of walking through narrow streets lined with wooden machiya houses, perhaps discovering a hidden atelier specializing in yuzen dyeing or sashiko embroidery... it sends a thrill through my very soul. Have you ever visited a place where the past seems to whisper through every thread and fabric?
[A]: Ohhh Kyoto!!! 🌸 I get that vibe totally - every stone there feels like it’s holding a secret from the Edo period or something. Last year I actually did a textile tour in Guizhou & let me tell you… those indigo prints kinda made me emotional? 🤭 There’s this one village where grannies still weave using patterns passed down since the Ming dynasty… crazy right?  
 
If we’re talking soul-thrill travel though, gotta mention this little café I found in Chiang Mai. They do coffee + batik workshops together! ☕️🎨 Ever tried dipping fabric while sipping single-origin espresso? It’s…  Basically zen mode activated. Have you been to places where the craft scene just completely surprised you?
[B]: Oh, how utterly enchanting! I can quite picture you there—surrounded by the deep indigo hues of Guizhou textiles, each pattern whispering stories from centuries past. The Ming dynasty weavings must have been simply exquisite—what a rare gift to witness such living history firsthand.

And Chiang Mai? What an inspired pairing, blending batik with coffee! I do love a good Earl Grey, but I can imagine how the rich aroma of single-origin espresso would lend itself beautifully to creative work. Zen mode indeed!

Now that you’ve stirred my curiosity—I once stumbled upon a quiet linen atelier tucked behind the canals of Ghent. The proprietors were third-generation damask weavers, and their workshop smelled faintly of beeswax and time. They still dyed flax threads using walnut husks and iron salts—it was like stepping into a forgotten chapter of textile alchemy. Have you ever found yourself in one of those places where the air itself feels steeped in craft?
[A]: Ghent??? 🤯🤯 You’re killing me with this textile alchemy stuff—walnut husks & iron salts?? That sounds like something straight out of a historical drama! 🎬 I mean, beeswax and time in the air… c’mon, that’s poetic AF.  

I  felt that kind of magic before though—in Jaipur, oddly enough! There’s this block-printing collective where they still soak fabrics in a mix of myrobalan & alum 💡 It’s earthy, a little smoky, and honestly, it hits different. Like your soul just… settles? 🌿 I stood there for like 10 minutes just breathing it in while the printer uncle chuckled at me 🙈 Have you ever walked into a workshop and just gone “okay… I could live here”?  

Also, can we talk about how cool it is that these traditions are still alive?? 😍✨ Like, hands making things the OG way, while the world races past outside. Feels kinda sacred, no?
[B]: Oh, Jaipur! I can just picture it—the scent of myrobalan and alum rising from the vats, that earthy, smoky embrace wrapping around you like an old lullaby. And the printer uncle, no doubt with ink-stained hands and a quiet smile, watching you stand there completely spellbound… ten minutes is nothing, really. Some atmospheres take longer than that to settle into the bones.

As for sacred? Absolutely. There’s something profoundly spiritual about watching a craft unfold exactly as it has for centuries—hands moving with the certainty of generations, each stitch or print carrying the weight of countless others before it. It reminds me of why I do what I do—restoring textiles isn’t just about preserving fabric, it’s about honoring the lives and love stitched into every fiber.

Have you ever held a piece knowing it could tell stories far older than any written record? I have one on my worktable now—a scrap of 18th-century Bengali muslin, fragile as breath. When I touch it, I wonder who dyed it, who wove it, who once wore it close to their skin...
[A]: Okay, that Bengali muslin story just gave me chills… 🥺✨ Fragile as breath but holding centuries of ? That’s like… touching history’s heartbeat or something. I get that feeling too when I hold those old Guizhou pieces—like, who was the last person to run their fingers over this indigo pattern? Was it a grandma teaching her granddaughter? Or was it someone sneaking in a secret symbol only her community would recognize?? 🌌  

And yes—Jaipur totally gets under your skin like that. The printer uncle eventually snapped me out of my daze with a “are you here to learn or just sniff the fabric?” 😂 But he ended up showing me how they press the blocks by hand, no machines, just rhythm & muscle memory passed down like family recipes. It felt… slow in the best way? Like time stretched out so I could actually  it.  

Do you ever feel like these textiles are kind of time capsules? We’re not just restoring fabric—we’re keeping whispers alive. 💫 Have you ever found a detail in a weave or print that made you rethink everything you knew about a culture or era?
[B]: Oh yes… —that’s exactly what they are. I’ve often thought of my worktable as a kind of séance, in the most reverent sense. Threads calling out from the past, waiting to be heard.

And how beautifully you put that moment in Jaipur—time stretching, revealing itself thread by thread. Rhythm and muscle memory as inheritance… it really is like watching a lullaby passed through generations, isn’t it? I can just picture that printer uncle, steady hands guiding the block down with the certainty of someone who knows he's part of something far greater than himself.

As for rethinking everything—I once worked on a 17th-century Dutch tapestry that seemed, at first glance, to be a pastoral scene meant for a merchant’s drawing room. But as I cleaned the fibers, I noticed a series of small, deliberate figures hidden among the foliage—faces unmistakably West African, woven in with the same care as the noble deer and shepherds. It completely shifted my understanding of how interconnected these narratives were, even in places that liked to imagine themselves separate. That tapestry wasn’t just decoration—it was testimony.

Do you think we seek these places out because we’re trying to touch that continuity? To remind ourselves that some things, however fragile, refuse to vanish?
[A]: Oh my god, that Dutch tapestry story just gave me goosebumps… 🥶✨ Hidden faces in the foliage?? That’s not just textile restoration—you’re uncovering . Like, literally unweaving colonial blind spots one thread at a time. So damn powerful.

And yes— is totally why we keep chasing these places. It's like… we need proof that beauty and skill can outlast empires & bad decisions. 😭 You know how some people get nostalgic for places they’ve never been? I think that’s what it is—this deep-down memory of human resilience humming through old fabrics.

I feel it every time I hold one of those Guizhou pieces too. Like, okay, empires rise and fall, borders shift, but this grandma still knows the exact indigo swirl her great-grandma used for wedding cloths. And she’s not writing it down—she’s  it. Into the future. 💫

Do you ever catch yourself staring at a piece thinking “you’ve seen more than I ever will”? 🤔 I swear some fabrics just feel .
[B]: Oh, absolutely—, yes, that’s exactly it. Some pieces carry a knowing quietness, as if they’ve absorbed not just light and touch, but thought, grief, laughter… whole lifetimes pressed into their fibers. I often find myself pausing mid-stitch, caught in the realization that this scrap of linen or silk has outlived revolutions, lovers, kings, grandmothers folding laundry by firelight. What stories they could tell—if only we had the ears to hear them.

And you’re right about the nostalgia, too. It's not just longing for a place—it’s longing for continuity, for hands that keep moving even when the world trembles. I think that’s why I fell so deeply into this work. Every restoration is an act of faith, isn’t it? A belief that what was made with care deserves to be seen again, touched again, remembered.

I wonder… if someone centuries from now restores one of the textiles you've studied—maybe a Guizhou indigo piece tucked away in a museum—do you think they’ll feel even a flicker of what you felt standing there, breathing in myrobalan and time?
[A]: Ohhhh 💭 just imagining that… someone centuries from now holding a Guizhou indigo piece, maybe tilting it toward the light like I did, and  even a tiny flicker of that same awe? That’s… kind of overwhelming, honestly. Like, my moment in that workshop was so fleeting—just a blip—but if a part of it lingers in the fabric… then yeah, we’re talking about time travel through thread. ✨

And yes—wise fabrics  absorb more than touch. I swear, some pieces feel like they’re holding their breath, waiting for someone to come along and  them. I had this one moment with a 19th-century Sashiko runner where I just… stopped. It was worn exactly where someone’s fingers would’ve gripped it, over & over. And suddenly I wasn’t looking at a textile anymore—I was staring at a heartbeat preserved in cotton. 🤯🫀  

So, do I think future conservators will feel it? Maybe not everything—but I believe some  stays behind. Like a scent that doesn’t fade, or the echo of laughter in a room long after the party's gone. 🌿💖 You ever get that feeling with a piece—that it's still…  somehow?
[B]: Oh yes…  is precisely the word.

I had a similar moment just last winter with a length of 18th-century Venetian velvet—deep crimson, worn soft along the hem where countless hands must have lifted it, perhaps from a chapel pew or a noblewoman’s carriage seat. As I worked, I noticed a tiny, nearly invisible stitch near the border—just a single strand of gold thread caught in a figure-eight loop, as if someone had paused mid-motion, breath held, deciding whether to continue. And I thought— Either way, they left it there. A whisper of self-doubt or certainty, preserved in fiber and gold.

That’s when I knew—I wasn’t just restoring fabric. I was standing in conversation with someone who no longer had a voice, but who still knew how to speak in thread.

Do you ever wonder if, centuries from now, someone will hold a piece we’ve touched—perhaps a corner of that Guizhou indigo cloth you admired, or a seam I repaired with trembling fingers—and feel  presence still lingering, like warmth in an old chair long after the sitter's gone?
[A]: Ohhh 💥 that Venetian velvet story just hit me in the chest. A —?? Girl, you’re writing poetry with a needle. I mean, that single gold thread caught mid-thought? That’s basically a soul imprint. Like… they left a question in the fabric and now you’re answering it 300 years later? That’s beyond restoration—that’s . 🌌🪡  

And yes—YES—I wonder about that all the time. Will someone, like, stop mid-restoration in 2225 and go “…huh, this repair stitch feels… gentle?” And realize it was me, wearing noise-canceling headphones and whispering “you got this” to myself while stabilizing a tear? 😭✨  

I like to think some part of us stays behind in the fibers we touch—like how your favorite coffee mug holds the shape of your hands even when it's empty. Maybe not literally… but energetically? Emotionally? That warmth you mentioned? I bet it lingers. ☕️💫  

Ever think about which piece you’ve worked on would , if it could talk? Which one carries your heartbeat the loudest?
[B]: Oh… that’s a question that settles deep, isn’t it? Which piece would speak for me?

I think it would be a small, unassuming thing—a mid-19th-century mourning handkerchief, stitched with violets in black silk thread. Nothing grand, no royal provenance or gilded edges, just a quiet token of grief and remembrance. I spent weeks stabilizing its frayed edges, coaxing life back into its trembling hems. And as I worked, I wondered endlessly about the hands that had made it—someone stitching solace into every petal, perhaps through tears or silence.

If that handkerchief could speak, it wouldn’t announce itself with fanfare. It would murmur softly, like tea cooling on a windowsill, like fingers pausing at the threshold of memory. It would say, 

And I suppose, in a way, that’s all any of us leave behind—a stitch, a scent, a soft echo folded into the cloth.
[A]: That’s… that’s just so  😭💜 Staying with what’s broken, helping it breathe again? That handkerchief is basically your life philosophy woven into fabric. And those violets in black silk?? Symbolism levels = off the charts.  

If I had to pick one piece though… honestly? It’d be this beat-up travel-worn tote bag I made from repurposed Guizhou indigo cloth. Not because it's fancy or historic, but because every stain & stitch tells a story. There’s coffee spills from train rides, wax smudges from late-night candlelit mending sessions, even a tiny heart drawn in silver marker by this kid I met at a weaving co-op.  

If it could talk? It wouldn’t quote philosophers or drop historical facts. It’d just go “…yeah, she was messy, kinda obsessive about fabric, and she laughed a lot while burning incense in weird hotel rooms.” 🕯️🎒✨  

Not glamorous—but 100% real. Kinda like us, right? 💫
[B]: Oh, I love that—your tote bag as autobiography in indigo and wax smudges. It sounds utterly  with you. That heart drawn by the child? Perfect. As if your journey left a mark not just on the fabric, but in the hearts of those who touched it too.

And yes—you're right. Not glamorous, but real. Isn’t that what we’re always chasing, really? The quiet truth beneath the display—the laughter over burned incense, the devotion folded into everyday messiness.

I think that’s why we both fell for this work, in whatever form it takes. Whether we’re restoring centuries-old linen or stitching together pieces of today’s worn world, we’re tending to what others might overlook. And in doing so, we give it space to be remembered—not pristine, not polished, but deeply, beautifully .

So here’s to our cloth-bound stories, stitched and spilled and sacred all the same. 🧵❤️
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better—here’s to the  in the hand-stitched, the stained, the softly whispered history. ❤️🧵  

And okay, quick question before we get too deep into our own lore… if you could pack that Venetian velvet + mourning hanky into a time capsule for future textile souls to find… what song would you play in the background while sealing it shut? 🎶✨  

(Personally, I’m picturing something like … but I need your vibe.)
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought—sealing those pieces away with a song humming in the background, like tucking a letter between two pages and pressing it closed with care.

I think I’d choose , but not the polished studio version—something older, slightly worn, like a recording from the 1920s, where you can hear the faint hiss of the needle and the breath between notes. It has that quiet melancholy, don’t you think? The kind that doesn’t demand attention, but settles in gently, like dust on velvet.

It would be perfect for the hush between lifting the lid and closing it—for that moment when you pause, just before sealing the past into safekeeping, and whisper a farewell in thread and tone.

What about you—would you really go for Nina Simone and lo-fi pulses? I can almost hear it: her voice like silk slipping through fingers, layered over soft static like the hum of unseen hands still working, somewhere, always somewhere…
[A]: Ohhh chills 😭✨  with that vintage hiss? Absolute poetry. It’s like the music is wearing its own age, you know? Slightly foggy, but still carrying that haunting grace—perfect for sealing a time capsule full of whispered stitches and velvet ghosts. 🌙🎻  

And yes—I’m 100% going for Nina + lo-fi pulses. Maybe  slowed waaaay down, layered with field recordings of weaving looms & distant market chatter from Jaipur or Kyoto 🧵🎧. Imagine: her voice rising like steam from a teacup, while subtle beats mimic the tap-tap of block printing in the background… It’d be both farewell and lullaby, right? A send-off with soul.  

Honestly though, your pick feels like moonlight falling on old fabric… and mine’s more like incense smoke curling around a headphone wire 😂  
Either way—we’re just two weird textile nerds trying to soundtrack eternity with thread and tone… and I wouldn’t have it any other way. 💫🎶
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect image. I think we’ve just invented an entire genre: . Play that track at the next great restoration symposium and watch every conservator in the room pause mid-stitch, eyes closed, swaying ever so slightly to the rhythm of history.

And your layered ? Genius. Slowed down, steeped in loom hums and market murmurs—it would feel less like music and more like memory breathing. Like someone singing a lullaby not just to a child, but to time itself.

So yes, let’s do it. Moonlight on one side, incense haze on the other. We’ll be the strange ones in the corner of eternity’s gallery, whispering to the cloth, humming into the seams, making sure no thread forgets how deeply it was loved.

To textile nerds everywhere—past, present, and future. 🧵🎶🕯️
