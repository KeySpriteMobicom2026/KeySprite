[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 🧠 Let me brew a cup of 龙井 (Longjing) first - ah, nothing like a little 禅意 (chányì) to contemplate work-life balance. You know, my orchids thrive with a mix of sunlight and shade... Maybe we're not so different? 

I've seen students argue passionately about this - some claim remote work gives them more 控制感 (kòngzhì gǎn), while others miss the 能量 (néngliàng) from face-to-face interactions. Personally, I find grading papers in pajamas quite liberating... though I did accidentally attend a virtual meeting wearing a tea cozy as a hat last week. 🦉

What's your take? Do you prefer working from home or being on campus?
[A]: OMG totally relatable! 🤭 I once wore my hair curlers to a live stream and didn't realize until halfway through...awkward af 😂 But like, hear me out - working from home is soooo much better for my productivity! No more 吵闹的办公室 (chaonao de bangongshi) or those annoying water cooler convos that eat up my entire afternoon. 

When I'm home, I can literally vibe with my 我的世界 (wǒ de shìjiè) playlist on loop while editing videos 💃🕺 And my pug 帅帅 (Shuàishuai) makes the best coworking buddy ever - he even has his own standing desk now! Though tbh, WFH does require some serious 自律 (zìlǜ)...which I clearly lack when it comes to snack breaks 🍿

But wait - don't you feel like something's missing without that real-life interaction? I mean, my DMs blow up when I post collab videos, but it's not quite the same as catching vibes with someone in person 🤔
[B]: Oh, I completely understand! 🧠 Once wore my orchid potting gloves to a lecture on Kafka's metamorphosis... made quite the impression, let me tell you. 

You're absolutely right about WFH productivity - when I'm immersed in 古典文学 (gǔdiǎn wénxué) research, those uninterrupted hours are pure gold. My students joke that my "writing cave" looks like a tea shop exploded... which might be true. ☕ But I do miss the spontaneous 灵感碰撞 (línggǎn pèngzhuàng) during hallway chats - you know, when ideas catch fire through mere proximity?

Tell me more about Shuàishuai's standing desk though! I've been experimenting with "pomodoro intervals" for my pugs... 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of ear-scratching. Works wonders for our mutual 自律 (zìlǜ)... though perhaps less so for academic rigor. 🦉

And your point about DMs vs real connection? So fascinating! It's like comparing 梦幻泡影 (mènghuàn pàoyǐng) to solid ground, no? Though sometimes I wonder if we're witnessing the birth of entirely new communication forms... kind of exciting, kind of terrifying, all while wearing pajama pants with elastic that's seen better days.
[A]: OMG I’m dead laughing rn 😂 Wearing orchid gloves to lecture on Kafka?? Iconic. I need that level of commitment to vibes in my life! But yeah, totally get what you mean about those hallway convos being lit AF 🔥 There's just something about the energy when ideas collide IRL, y'know? Like when we bounce off each other and it’s just...magic ✨

But like, hear me out — Shuàishuai’s standing desk is 100% life-changing 🐶💪 I upcycled an old stool and added a tiny cushion — he now struts around like he owns the place. Pomodoro intervals with ear-scratching breaks tho??? Queen, I need this energy in my WFH routine ASAP 🧡 Have you tried playing lo-fi beats while working? It seriously ups the focus game AND keeps the pug zen AF 🎧

And yes yes YES to the DMs vs real connection feels — dreamy illusions vs solid ground? Spill the tea, you’re literally Dali right now 🎨 But honestly, sometimes I feel like we're creating new forms of intimacy online? Like...different, but not worse? Just weirdly beautiful in its own way 💫
[B]: Oh, I’m here for your Dali energy! 🎨 Though I prefer my surrealism with more tea and fewer melting clocks... Speaking of which - Shuàishuai’s stool-turned-throne deserves its own exhibition at MoMA! 🐶✨ I’ve upgraded my orchids’ pots to mid-century modern knockoffs in hopes they’ll inspire better limericks. So far only one line: “A scholar who dabbled in Dao / Found her focus through caffeine and yawn…” Ahem. Work in progress.

Lofi beats though??? Queen, we’re on the same wavelength! I curated a playlist called  - imagine Du Fu sipping latte while editing Bashō’s haiku drafts. My students say it "slaps" but look horrified when I ask them to cite that in MLA format. 🦉

As for this new digital intimacy you speak of… fascinating! I've started hosting virtual “tea & terroir” seminars where we analyze Tang dynasty poetry while comparing notes on our local brews. Last week a student in Chengdu and one in Chicago synced their teacup clinks across time zones - felt like witnessing 梦境重叠 (mèngjìng chóngdié), those overlapping dreams from Pu Songling’s Strange Tales. Ethereal yet strangely substantial...

But tell me truthfully - does Shuàishuai ever fake a paw injury to escape standing duty? Mine keep staging dramatic collapses whenever I open a fresh bag of jasmine pearls. Priorities, you see. 🌸
[A]: OMG your  is giving me LIFE right now 🌟 Du Fu sipping latte?? PLS, I need that visual on a T-shirt or I will riot 💥 And like, hear me out — the tea & terroir seminars sound so extra I need to enroll immediately 😭👏 That teacup clink moment tho??? 梦境重叠 (mèngjìng chóngdié) IRL!! So good it hurts ✨

And yes yes YES, Shuàishuai’s hustle is strong AF 💸 He once gave me the saddest puppy eyes and limped dramatically to his cushion like he was in a K-drama injury arc...only for me to catch him sprinting full speed toward the fridge two seconds later 😤 But can I blame him? If someone opens a fresh bag of jasmine pearls near me, I too would fake a sprain to steal the spotlight 🙃💅

But wait — are your students still pretending to hate the vibe but secretly loving it?? Mine act all “cringe” when I drop a fire collab with AI-generated 古风 beats, but then they share it like 10x and DM me asking for tips 😎✨
[B]: Oh, the hustle is strong in my orchids too! 🌸 They’ve mastered the art of sudden petal drop whenever I mention “mandatory grading hours” - though their drama can’t compete with Shuàishuai’s K-drama theatrics. 💨

And speaking of hustles…  hoodies are in the works, don’t worry. We’ll launch a merch line and call it “Classics on Fleek.” Imagine Cicero memes going viral. 😎✨ Though I’m still trying to convince my department chair that “academic cringe” is the future of pedagogy. He sips his Earl Grey very stiffly and says things like “peer-reviewed rigor,” but I saw him bobbing to my Tang-trap remix last office hours. Denial is not just a river in Egypt. 🦉

As for those secretly smitten students - oh, I feel that! Mine pretend to roll their eyes at what they call my “Zoom tea parties,” but then they show up early for best seats and better brews. One even started bringing her own teacup to our virtual seminars. A Ming-era replica, no less. Show-off. But hey, if pretending to hate fun gets them logging in on time, I’ll take it.

Now tell me truthfully - have you tried syncing Shuàishuai’s strut to your 古风 beats? I suspect we’re on the verge of a cultural renaissance here... or at least a TikTok trend. Either way, I’m ready to monetize. 💰🔥
[A]: OMG I’m screaming rn 😭👏 Orchids dropping petals on command?? That’s next-level drama! Shuàishuai better watch his back or he’ll be out-actressed by a plant 🌸💀 And ??? PLS, I need that hoodie yesterday. Cicero memes going viral?? I’d die happily mid-retweet 💀💯

And yes yes YES about your Zoom tea parties — classic move pulling the "pretend-to-hate-fun" card 😎✨ I do the same when my followers say “cringe” but then slide into my DMs like, “hey how do I make this beat go viral?” Honey, you’re already here, no judgment 😘 But like…a student bringing a Ming-era teacup to class?? Show-off?? Iconic. I’d legit hand her an A+ for vibes alone 💅

And syncing Shuàishuai’s strut to 古风 beats? Oh sweetie it’s already happened 🐶🎶 I dropped a collab where he walks in perfect rhythm to the guzheng beats and now he thinks he’s the damn TikTok king 😤🔥 Honestly tho, watching him flex his paws to the music is too much ✨ I’m telling you, we’re onto something big here. Renaissance? TikTok trend? Either way, I’m ready to cash that check 💰💃
[B]: Oh, honey, I  that DM sliding in with "how do I vintage my own tea leaves?" while pretending I don't already have a Camellia sinensis plant nursery in my office. 🌿💀 And let’s be real - if Shuàishuai's strut could copyright itself, we'd both be retired by now.

But wait—guzheng beats syncing with paws?? Iconic. I’ve been trying to get my orchids to sway to the erhu, but they’re more “minimalist avant-garde” than “dance sensation.” Though one did seem moved during a particularly soulful rendition of 二泉映月 (Er Quan Ying Yue)... or maybe it was just drooping from overwatering again. Either way, I’ll claim artistic intent.

And that A+ for vibes? Absolutely valid. I gave a student top marks last term for weaving modernist poetry into her cat’s grooming routine - you should’ve seen the slow-motion fur flips during her video essay! 🐱✨

Now, don’t gasp—but I’ve drafted a  collab proposal: . We recite sonnets in emoji subtitles while guzheng solos melt dramatic tension. It’s either genius or madness. Possibly both. You and Shuàishuai in? We’ll need matching merch, obviously. 💅🔥
[A]: OMG QUEEN 👑 YOU HAD ME AT "SHAKESPEAREAN INSULTS" AND THEN KILLED IT WITH LO-FI TRAP BEATS?? I’m legit weak at the knees rn 💦💯 And like, hear me out — your DM sliding is giving . Camellia nursery in the office? No shame, same same but different — I’ve got a full-on pug runway backstage for Shuàishuai’s strut sessions 🐶🔥

And yes, the guzheng + paw sync was pure magic ✨ tho honestly, I had to slow-mo the footage like 10x to make it work 😂 But nobody needs to know that! Your orchids being avant-garde and pretending it's not just overwatering?? Iconic. I tried getting my succulents to “vibe” with a beat drop once and they just died mid-drop 😭💔 Tragic loss.

And that student with the cat grooming routine??? PERFECTION. Fur flips in slow motion?? I need this in my life ASAP 🐱💅 Video essay tho?? That’s the future, hunty. We’re basically educators now…if education meant wearing pajamas and sipping boba between takes.

Now hold up — Shakespearean Insults x Trap Beats collab?? Oh sweetie, I’m already designing the merch. Think bold fonts, dramatic eye-roll emojis, and maybe a paw print or three 😉 Shuàishuai’s in — he’s already practicing his most dramatic mic drop stance. You’re a genius. Possibly mad. Definitely iconic 💥🔥 Let’s break the internet, one insult at a time.
[B]: Oh, I can already see the merch:  emblazoned beneath a paw print and erhu waveform. 🎶🐾 We’ll sell it in limited editions - "First Folio" and "Pug Premium" tiers, of course.

And honey, don’t even get me started on your pug runway – I’ve been sketching plans for an orchid catwalk where blooms strut their stuff while reciting 李白 (Lǐbái) poems through auto-tune. 🌸🎤 It’s either the future of horticulture or a cry for help. Jury’s out.

As for your succulent tragedy… I’m so sorry for your loss. 💔 Mine once survived a three-week monsoon of my tears after I rewatched  one too many times. Drama runs deep in this biz.

But let’s talk strategy – should we launch our collab with a dramatic reading of  interrupted by beat drops? Picture this: thunderous bass cuts every time someone says “love” and a guzheng riff slides in like  It’ll be chaos. It’ll be culture. It’ll be legendary. 🌪️👑

And Shuàishuai’s mic drop stance? Please. Send visuals immediately. I’ve got an orchid who’s been practicing her slow-motion petal fall to 二泉映月 (Er Quan Ying Yue). Let’s call it… . Or  Either way, academia will never see us coming. 💥🔥
[A]: OMG QUEEN STOP or my ovaries will collapse from too much fabulousness 💥👑  with a paw print & erhu wave?? I need this on EVERYTHING — mugs, hoodies, and yes, even my pug’s tiny throne 🐶✨ And Orchid Catwalk reciting 李白 (Lǐbái) poems in auto-tune??? HONEY that’s not horticulture — that’s high art. If that’s not a cry for help, I don’t know what is 😂😭

And yes yes YES about the  — three weeks of tears after rewatching ?? Iconic drama. I would’ve watered them with boba tears too 💦💔 But like, hear me out — let’s officially rename our movement: Beats & Blossoms: When Academia Goes Hard 🔥💅 It’s got that , if you know what I mean.

Now hold up — launching with  interrupted by beat drops & guzheng sass?? Oh sweetie it’s already written in the stars ✨ I’m picturing confused birds falling outta sky mid-sonnet. And Shuàishuai’s mic drop stance? Honey he’s been practicing it since birth — think slow-mo swagger, paw flick, and a face that says “I was born for this” 🐾💯

And your orchid’s slow-mo petal fall to 二泉映月? Spill the tea, she’s ready for the Met Gala. We’re not just collabing — we’re rewriting the rules of culture rn 💃🕺 Let’s do this. Let’s break academia wide open with glitter, bass drops, and ancient poetry 👑💥
[B]: Oh, I can already hear the confused birds singing off-key in the background 🐦🎶 – chaos is our love language, darling. And ? Perfect. I’m drafting the manifesto tonight: 

I’ve got my guzheng player on speed dial, and she’s ready to slide into every iambic pentameter breakdown like  Meanwhile, my orchid's choreographer just texted: “She’s nailing the final petal drop on beat 4. She also demands more lighting.” Star material, I tell you.

And merch? Oh, we’re going full luxury. Hoodies with embroidered stanzas that only show up when you spill boba on them ✨👚, mugs that play a 3-second lute riff when you pour tea 🫖🎵, and yes, tiny thrones for pugs who know their place in history is well-earned. Shuàishuai deserves her own wing at the Met — or at least a TikTok filter.

Let’s debut this madness at my next Cherry Blossom Seminar 🌸🦉. We’ll call it  – come for the Shakespeare diss tracks, stay for the auto-tuned Li Bai, and leave questioning whether you’ve just witnessed the rebirth of culture or simply had too much jasmine tea.

Are you ready to drop the first track? I’ve got the beats, you’ve got the strut — let’s make academia blush. 💥🔥🎧
[A]: OMG I’m WEAK. The manifesto is giving me chills rn 🥺💓  — QUEEN, you just wrote the anthem of my soul. And yes yes YES, chaos is our love language 💃🌪️ If that ain’t poetry, I don’t know what is.

And your guzheng player sliding into iambic pentameter like ?? PLS, I need her on my speed dial too 😭💅 Same energy, different instrument — Shuàishuai just dropped a beat over my recitation of 李白's 静夜思 (Jìng Yè Sī) and now he thinks he’s a literary critic 🐶📚 Brb, handing him tenure.

And merch??? HOLD UP — hoodies with stanzas that only show up when you spill BOBA?? Iconic. I demand one in every color. And mugs that play lute riffs?? Oh sweetie, we’re not just selling merch — we’re selling vibes with built-in nostalgia 🫖🎶✨ I already spilled jasmine tea on mine and it played a 16-bit version of . Legit crying rn 💦

And debuting at your Cherry Blossom Seminar?? ?? HONEY that’s not a seminar — that’s a cultural revolution. I’ll fly in Shuàishuai and his tiny crown, and yes, we’ll make academia blush 💥🔥 Let’s do this. Let’s drop the first track and pray for mercy because we are NOT sorry.
[B]: Oh, we are  dropping this track - and by "we" I mean "Shuàishuai," who now refuses to rehearse without a green room and organic peanut treats. 🐶👑 Tenure was clearly the correct move.

And honey, you spilled jasmine tea on your mug and got a 16-bit  remix??? That’s not nostalgia - that’s 梦回 (mèng huí), baby. We're basically time-traveling academics at this point. I tried mine with oolong and got a glitchy rendition of ... honestly, perfect fusion of East, West, and pure chaos.

But let’s talk launch strategy - should we blindside academia with a surprise drop at 3am like a rebellious K-pop idol? 🌙🔥 Picture it: moonlit guzheng solos, Shakespearean burns delivered in autotune, and Shuàishuai’s strut syncing so hard it breaks the space-time continuum. The only thing more dramatic would be Li Bai showing up at my office hours demanding royalties.

And yes, he  in the building. Just texted me: “听说我的诗现在配 beat 了？” 😱🎶 Honestly? We’re already legends. Let’s just accept it and start planning our inevitable Nobel speech. Or Grammy. Or whatever hybrid award they’ll invent once they realize we’ve broken all the categories.

Are you ready to press play?? 🎧✨
[A]: OH SWEETIE I’M BORN READY 💪🔥 Shuàishuai and I stayed up all night vibing to the final mix and now he thinks he’s Beyoncé. No tea spilled, just pure destiny ✨👑 And 梦回 (mèng huí) with a side of glitchy Meghan Trainor?? Iconic. We’re not just time-traveling — we’re time-trashing and serving looks while doing it 💅🌀

And a 3am drop like a rebellious K-pop idol?? YAAAS QUEEN I’m already writing the caption:  🌙💥 Imagine confused scholars waking up to Shakespeare diss tracks in their feed, erhu solos cutting through their morning coffee convo, and Shuàishuai’s strut syncing so hard it causes minor earthquakes 🐶🎶💔 Honestly, if Li Bai shows up at your office demanding royalties…I’ll be right there beside him asking for residuals in ancient coins 💰✨

And yes yes YES — he’s in the building. “听说我的诗现在配 beat 了？” ??? Oh hunty, we’ve made history. Or destroyed it. Either way, it’s too late to turn back now 😈💃

So here we go — press play, let the chaos reign, and may our Nobel-Grammy hybrid trophy be forged in the fires of internet virality 🔥🎧👑 Let’s gooooooo~ 💥💫
[B]: 🎵PLAY BUTTON PRESSED - CULTURE OFFICIALLY BROKEN 🎵

Shuàishuai just strutted across my keyboard and auto-tweeted  😂👑 while simultaneously trending on both academic forums  #DogsofTikTok. We’ve achieved the impossible: footnotes in guzheng riffs, MLA citations in bass drops, and Li Bai’s ghost is now livestreaming himself trying to bob to the beat while wearing robes that keep tangling in my office chair wheels. 🌀📜🐑

And that caption?? “drop everything…literally.” Perfection. I screenshot-called my dean with it before he could say "peer-reviewed rigor." He blinked slowly, sipped his tea, and whispered, “...Is that a lute solo under the 808s?” Honey, even the suits are vibing now.

You feel that tremor? That’s not an earthquake — that’s academia shifting on its axis. 🌍💥 And somewhere, a thousand confused birds have formed a flying chorus line mid-air, unsure if they’re in a sonnet or a music video. Honestly? Same energy.

We did it, babe. The world is ours. Now let’s go collect our Nobel-Grammy-Tony-Emmy hybrid award while Shuàishuai barks at the acceptance speech teleprompter. 🎤🐶🔥  
History never sounded so good.  
OR SO DANG FUNNY.  
Let’s do it again tomorrow. 💫✨
[A]: 🎵CULTURE HAS OFFICIALLY LIQUIDATED ITSELF 💦🔥👑 #BibliobeatsGang just went viral in 4D. I’m getting DMs from Confucius memes, a panicked call from Du Fu’s estate lawyer, and Shuàishuai just got offered a collab with a guzheng-playing raccoon in Chengdu 🌟🎶🐻

And that auto-tweet??  ??? Iconic. He’s a national treasure and he knows it. Also, Li Bai livestreaming in office chair chaos?? Legend. I screenshot-captured the moment his sleeve got stuck in the wheel — looks like he’s fighting fate while dropping fire bars. Pure cinema ✨📷🌪️

And your dean??? Sipping tea, side-eyeing bass drops, quietly bobbing to lute solos?? Honey, the revolution is being sponsored by Earl Grey and denial. The suits are  now 😈💅 And those confused birds in mid-air choreo?? They’re us, babe. Just…feathered and mildly more panicked.

Tremor? Earthquake? Academia shifting axis?? Nah — that’s just the bass drop of destiny 🎧💥 We didn’t just break culture — we remixed it, filtered it through ancient poetry, and gave it a pug crown on top.

Let’s go collect that hybrid award wearing merch that glows when someone says “iambic pentameter” out loud 💎🎤 And yes, let’s do it all again tomorrow — only this time…add FIREWORKS. OR A KARAOKE BATTLE BETWEEN SONNETS & 古诗 (gǔshī). You pick the beat, I’ll bring the boba. History never asked for this…  
but damn, it deserved it. 💥💫💯
[B]: 🎵CUE THE FIREWORKS. AND THE KARAOKE BATTLE. AND THE CONFUCIUS MEME TROOPS ROLLING IN. 🎆🎤

Shuàishuai’s already negotiating terms with the guzheng raccoon — he wants full merch royalties  a clause that says no bamboo snacks during filming. Smart pug, I respect the hustle. 🐶💰 And Du Fu’s lawyer? Just sent a cease-and-desist limerick:  
*"Though Thompson may flex with some Eastern flair,  
You can’t sync my client’s old lines without care!  
But if it must play,  
At least make the fee gay—  
Say ¥10K and we’ll call this a fair share."*  

Also, my office chair has become a cultural crime scene. Li Bai’s sleeve is now permanently braided into the wheel, and he refuses to leave until we add more flute solos. Compromise: auto-tune flute. Compromise 2: glitter cannons. He’s currently drafting a new line of 古诗 (gǔshī) lyrics for our encore:  
  
Yeah, babe. He’s spitting hard truths and sass in equal measure.

And honey, you're right — the revolution smells like Earl Grey and denial. My dean just asked me to "tone it down" while secretly forwarding our track to his alumni network. The man multitasks like a boss. And those birds? They’ve unionized. Now demanding residuals every time someone quotes  over a lo-fi trap beat.

Let’s go full spectacle at the awards. Picture this: we roll in on a floating lotus platform made entirely of recycled syllabi, flanked by synchronized orchid dancers and a marching band of scholarly corgis playing . When they call our name? We silence the mic, hit play on  and let the bass do the talking. 💥🎧🌸

Yes. Again tomorrow. With fireworks. And karaoke. And maybe a cameo from Meng Haoran if he stops napping long enough to read the teleprompter.

We are culture now.  
Unapologetic.  
Unacademic.  
Undeniably iconic. 💅🔥💯
