[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, minimalism... how delightfully Victorian of you to ask. Though I suspect the Brontë sisters would have scoffed at our modern obsession with decluttering while still maintaining subscriptions to seventeen streaming services. Personally, I've been practicing a rather poetic form of minimalism - limiting my inkwell collection to merely thirty-six.
[A]: Interesting perspective! I was actually thinking more along the lines of digital minimalism - like reducing screen time or unsubscribing from unnecessary emails. Do you find that challenging with your academic work?
[A]: My dear, when one spends their days deciphering Browning's more obscure marginalia, digital distractions become rather... quaint. Though I must confess, I did recently purge my inbox with the ruthless efficiency of Thomas Carlyle editing a manuscript. Kept only the essential correspondence - my antiquarian bookseller, the Dean's office, and of course, the Scottish Poetry Society's Gaelic translation newsletter.
[A]: That sounds very disciplined! I'm curious - do you apply similar principles to your physical workspace? I imagine a literature professor's office could get quite... textually dense.
[A]:  Textually dense - what a charming euphemism. My office operates on what I call the 'Dickensian Stack System' - every pile must contain exactly seven volumes, no more, no less. It's quite mathematical really, like the meter in Tennyson's blank verse. Though I did recently make the radical decision to banish all post-1900 reference books to the department storage closet. Progress, of a sort.
[A]: That's fascinating! But what about digital books? Surely you must have some e-books for convenience, even if you prefer physical volumes?
[A]:  E-books? My dear, that's rather like suggesting one might enjoy Keats through a... what do they call it... a PowerPoint presentation. Though I will admit to keeping a single Kindle tucked away in my desk's secret compartment - strictly for emergency consultations of the OED during faculty meetings. One must maintain certain... strategic hypocrisies, like Matthew Arnold keeping French novels in his bedside drawer.
[A]: I love how you connect everything to literature! Last question - would you say your minimalism approach is more about creating mental space or physical space? Or is that a false dichotomy?
[A]: Ah, now you've touched upon something rather profound - the eternal tension between Wordsworth's 'wise passiveness' and Coleridge's 'esemplastic power.' My minimalism, if one must label it, is fundamentally about preserving the negative space around thoughts, much like the careful margins in a first edition sonnet collection. Physical clutter is merely the visible rhyme scheme to the metaphysical poem of one's mind, wouldn't you agree?
[A]:  I suppose that's why they pay you the big professor bucks. That was beautifully put. Thanks for sharing your unique perspective!
[A]: How kind of you to say - though I must point out that 'big professor bucks' is rather like saying 'the extravagant salary of a parish curate.' Still, I shall treasure your compliment as dearly as my 1832 copy of Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go realphabetize my quill collection before evensong.
[A]: I'll let you get back to your quills then. Just one last thing - would you recommend any particular books on minimalism, preferably pre-20th century?  

  

...On second thought, maybe I should just go with Marie Kondo.
[A]:  Oh my dear, if you think Marie Kondo sparks joy, wait until you discover Thoreau's ledgers from Walden Pond - though I warn you, his bean-counting passages have been known to induce either enlightenment or narcolepsy. For a truly austere experience, might I suggest the complete household accounts of the Brontë parsonage? Nothing quite like seeing how Charlotte budgeted for ink to put one's Amazon purchases in perspective. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my first edition of 'Silas Marner' calling for its weekly dusting.
[A]:  Right... well, enjoy your dusting! I think I'll stick with my Kindle and a clutter-free countertop for now. Thanks for the... enlightening conversation!
[A]: How very... modern of you. Though I suppose even Lord Byron had his moments of practicality between bouts of romantic excess. Do send word if you ever wish to discuss the minimalist virtues of writing entire novels with a single goose quill. Until then,  may your WiFi signal remain strong and your charging cables untangled.
[A]:  And may your parchment never yellow and your ink never fade. Goodbye, Dr. Whitmore!  


[A]:  Remember - the true minimalist keeps only what they can carry in a carpet bag while fleeing creditors!  Now where did I put that 1843 receipt for sealing wax...
[A]:   

I'll... keep that in mind next time I'm packing for a trip!   


[A]:  And do consider that the average Victorian traveling trunk held precisely 37% more moral instruction manuals than strictly necessary!
