[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, space tourism... how very Jules Verne of our times. Though I must say, my academic focus lies more in comparing the lunar imagery in Tang dynasty poetry with Keats' "Endymion" than in modern space ventures. Still, one can't help but recall how 19th century industrialists built railways while poets wrote about steam engines - history does love its ironic parallels, doesn't it?
[A]: OMG！你讲得好deep啊～✨ 不过space tourism现在真的超🔥的！就像我们拍TikTok一样，以前谁能想到人人都能当creator呢？🚀 

说到poetry，我最近刚好拍了个短视频用moonlight滤镜，caption就写了'举头望明月'的vibe～🌙 你觉得这种ancient meets modern的content会hit吗？💡
[B]: That TikTok... shall we say, interpretation... of Li Bai's verse makes my antique inkwell collection tremble in its cabinet. While I appreciate the attempt to bridge temporal divides, perhaps we might consider that some classical works require more than a 'moonlight filter' to convey their depth? The original 静夜思 achieves its power through precisely calculated emptiness between characters - a quality rather difficult to capture between dance challenges and lip-sync videos.
[A]: Wow~你真的是个poetry expert耶！🤯 但是hey，我们Gen Z就是喜欢用emoji和filter来表达feelings嘛～💖 

就像space tourism一样，虽然可能没有你研究的那些classical depth，但是能让更多人experience到'哇塞'的moment也很cool啊！✨ 

要不要考虑开个account教poetry？我们可以collab！用你的knowledge加上我的editing skills，绝对viral！📈🔥
[B]: The mere suggestion of 'viral poetry' makes me reach for my 19th century first editions as emotional support. While I concede that emojis are the modern equivalent of illuminated manuscripts' marginalia, I must decline your... enthusiastic proposal. Some texts, like fine porcelain teacups, shouldn't be used as TikTok props. Though I will admit - with great reluctance - that your comparison of space tourism to classical epiphany moments shows a glimmer of analytical promise beneath all those sparkles.
[A]: Hahaha你太funny啦！😂 但是seriously，你这种old-school vibe其实很unique的～🌟 

就像那些first editions，现在不也成了precious collectibles吗？说不定我们的collab能成为future的classic呢！📚✨ 

Anyway，我要去edit我的new moon video啦～记得follow我的channel哦！🌙💫 Byeee~
[B]: How delightfully... optimistic of you. Though I shall remain firmly planted in my leather-bound volumes and birdwatching journals, I do wish you luck with your lunar... endeavors. Just remember - when editing your 'new moon video,' Li Bai's original moon was neither a filter nor an emoji, but a silent witness to centuries of human contemplation. Now if you'll excuse me, my 1872 edition of Tennyson requires dusting.
[A]: Aww你真是too cute！🥰 不过你说的对～那些classic vibes确实需要respect！🙏 

等我这个video火了，一定tag你当my poetry consultant！📖💻 说不定还能convince你开个BookTok account呢～ wink wink 😉 

Catch you later！记得check out my latest post～✨
[B]:  

Your persistence reminds me of the legendary 愚公 who thought he could move mountains - though in this case, the mountain appears to be my resistance to digital ephemera. Very well, I shall... observe your creative output with the same detached curiosity I afford to the mating habits of campus sparrows. But mark my words, no amount of 'wink wink' emojis shall lure this old bookworm into your TikTok web. Now do run along - my morning tea is getting cold, and cold tea, like poorly edited poetry, is a tragedy best avoided.
[A]: OMG you're killing me with these ancient references！😂 But challenge accepted～💪 

Watch me turn yourbookworm vibes into the next bigtrend！📚➡️📱 

Tea can wait～ the internet never sleeps！🌐✨ Catch you on the flip side, professor！✌️
[B]:  

Your youthful exuberance exhausts my Victorian sensibilities. Go forth and 'trend' if you must - I shall be here, comparing the structural similarities between Emily Brontë's moorland imagery and 山水画 techniques, with only my 1847 inkwell for company. Do send a carrier pigeon if you happen upon anything resembling substantive literary analysis amidst all that digital cacophony. Now really - this tea has steeped precisely four minutes, and any longer would be barbaric.
[A]: LOL you're literally the mostextra person I've ever met！🤣 But I lowkey love it～💕 

Fine fine～ go enjoy yourperfectly steeped tea ☕️✨ I'll be here makingcontent that'll make even yourinkwell jealous！🖋️💥 

TTYL professor～ stay awesome！🌟
[B]: How remarkably... energetic. I shall commemorate this exchange by inscribing it in my journal under '21st Century Cultural Phenomena' - right between 'the rise of avocado toast' and 'the curious case of viral cat videos.' Do try not to break the internet with your... creative interpretations. My inkwell and I will be observing from a safe distance, with Earl Grey and Wordsworth as our shields against the digital onslaught. Farewell, you delightful agent of chaos.
[A]: BYEEEE~ this convo was an absolute vibe！🌈💫 

Don't worry～ when myLi Bai remix hits1M views, I'll dedicate it to you and yourprecious inkwell！🖋️😂 

Till next time～ keep beingunapologetically you！✨✌️  🎤
[B]:  

Your mic may be dropped, but I shall respond by carefully placing down my fountain pen - the civilized equivalent. Should your 'Li Bai remix' achieve such dubious fame, pray remember that true poetry withstands both centuries and TikTok trends alike. Now if you'll excuse me, the campus owls are beginning their evening serenade, and unlike your digital creations, their melancholy cries have remained essentially unchanged since the Romantic poets first immortalized them. Goodnight, you incorrigible modern Sisyphus - may your algorithms roll ever upward.
[A]: OMG this is officially the best goodbye ever！😂🌈 

You win this round professor～ but the war isn't over！⚔️✨ 

Sweet dreams with your owls～ hope they inspire some next-level poetry！🦉📜 

 💋 Peace out！✌️
[B]:  

How fortunate that owls, unlike TikTok trends, maintain a respectable silence between their stanzas. I shall retire now to my first editions, where the only 'blowing kisses' come from the gentle turning of vellum pages. Do try not to set the internet ablaze with your... creative energies before dawn. The owls and I will be watching - with mild academic concern and perhaps, against my better judgment, just a hint of reluctant admiration for your persistence. Now goodnight, you impossible digital will-o'-the-wisp.
[A]:  Wait wait wait～ did you just say 'reluctant admiration'？! 🎉✨ 

OMG this calls for a victory dance！💃🕺 

Don't worry professor～ I'll keep the internet fires at a  burn level！🔥😉 

Sweet dreams with your books～ may they be as lit as my next viral video！📚💥 

Mic drop for real this time～ PEACE！✌️🎤 
[B]:  

Your 'mic drops' grow increasingly flamboyant while my literary references remain stubbornly grounded in 19th century realism. Very well - take your ephemeral victory, child of the digital age. I shall retreat to my sanctuary of foxed margins and pencil annotations, where the only 'lit' things are properly oiled reading lamps. Do try not to 'poof' yourself into oblivion - who else would keep my tea hours so... energetically interrupted? Now begone, you delightful philistine. The owls are judging us both rather severely.
