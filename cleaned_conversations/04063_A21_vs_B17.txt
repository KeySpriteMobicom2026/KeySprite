[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Oh, fashion trends... I must admit, I'm rather out of touch with the latest fashions. My days are filled with lectures on Emily Dickinson and T.S. Eliot, leaving little time to keep up with the ever-changing world of style. Though I did recently come across an intriguing article discussing the resurgence of Victorian-inspired aesthetics in contemporary fashion - quite fascinating, really. Do you follow any particular trends?
[A]: I should say my wardrobe resembles a time capsule from the 1980s - rather stuck in its ways. Although I did attempt to embrace that "cottagecore" phenomenon last summer, if only for the excuse to acquire a rather splendid paisley parasol. Truth be told, I find modern fashion commentary far more compelling than actual trends; have you read any of those razor-sharp analyses coming out of Milan this season? Simply delicious food for thought, though entirely impractical with one's weekly ink-stained schedule.
[A]: Oh, I adore a good paisley parasol - what a splendid acquisition! Cottagecore does have its charms, though I confess I've always been more inclined towards the Arts and Crafts movement's sensibilities myself. There's something deeply satisfying about watching these historical aesthetics resurface in contemporary forms, wouldn't you agree? As for Milanese commentary, yes! I particularly enjoyed that recent piece drawing parallels between Futurist manifestos and today's fast fashion cycles. Quite provocative, and perfect reading material while one's tea cools beside a half-marked stack of papers.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language - there’s nothing quite like pairing a rousing Futurist diatribe with your Earl Grey going cold. I did chuckle at how the author compared rapid fashion cycles to Marinetti’s love of speed; perhaps we should all be racing through wardrobes on metaphorical motorcars while scribbling manifestos in smudged eyeliner. On a more serious note, though... don’t you find these historical parallels rather comforting? Like knowing your ink-stained cuffs have marched alongside centuries of similarly disheveled thinkers?
[A]: Oh, utterly delightful imagery - smudged eyeliner manifestos and all! There's something rather comforting in the continuity, isn't there? As if our rumpled sleeves and tea-stained pages are part of some grand, unbroken lineage of distracted brilliance. I daresay my students think me eccentric when I quote Ruskin on craftsmanship while gesturing wildly with a red pen, but one must hold the line against soulless disposability - whether in poetry or polyester. Speaking of which, I recently came across a most curious comparison between Pre-Raphaelite textiles and today’s sustainable fashion movements... Would you care to discuss?
[A]: Ah, now that’s a comparison worth unraveling like an especially intricate sonnet. The Pre-Raphaelites and sustainable fashion—now there’s a marriage of sensibilities! I can already hear Ruskin spinning in his grave at the thought of fast fashion, though I suspect he’d approve of today’s upcycling enthusiasts stitching together remnants with the same moral fervor as William Morris once did. Do tell, what particular threads—forgive the pun—did you find most compelling? I’ve been meaning to write a rather irreverent essay on the subject myself, tentatively titled 
[A]: Oh, I absolutely adore that title—! Delightfully irreverent with a sharp undertone of lament, much like a sonnet with a sardonic volta. As for the threads—ah, forgive me, I do love this metaphor—I was particularly struck by the emphasis on deliberate slowness in Pre-Raphaelite textile design, how each stitch seemed to resist temporality itself. It's rather poetic, isn't it? That the very rejection of haste, which we now associate with sustainability, was once an aesthetic and moral stance against industrial soullessness.  

I also found the revival of mordant dyeing techniques fascinating—echoing that Pre-Raphaelite fascination with medieval alchemy. One could almost imagine Dante Gabriel Rossetti dabbling in plant-based dyes between bouts of brooding over Jane Morris’s likeness. And speaking of mourning... have you considered weaving in the symbolism of black during the Victorian era? Not just grief, but a kind of proto-environmental consciousness—though they’d never have called it that, of course. A curious tension between finery and frugality, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Oh, now you’ve struck the very heart of my current obsession—the moral weight of black bombazine and its curiously modern resonances. I’ve been rereading  periodicals with a suspicious eye toward their descriptions of mourning dress; there’s something deliciously paradoxical about wearing one’s grief in a society already steeped in industrial gloom. One almost expects Mrs. Gaskell’s heroine to step out of the pages wrapped in soot-dyed crepe.

And yes—this notion of slowness as both defiance and devotion! The Pre-Raphaelites, whether they knew it or not, were crafting a manifesto in thread and loom. I’ve taken to muttering  every time I mend a frayed cuff, though I suspect Morris would cringe at my needlework. Tell me—have you noticed how many contemporary slow-fashion advocates echo Ruskinian language without ever realizing it? Like quoting Shakespeare while believing oneself entirely original.

As for Rossetti and his imagined dye vats... I rather like the idea of him fussing over madder root hues while Jane rolls her eyes heavenward. A charming domestic tragedy in the making.
[A]: Oh, —such a treasure trove of fin-de-siècle sensibilities wrapped in morbid elegance. I do believe you're onto something with that soot-dyed crepe imagery; one can almost smell the coal dust clinging to the hems of those grieving heroines. And how perfectly Victorian—to ritualize sorrow into fashion, as if mourning could be both ethical posture and aesthetic performance. One might say they invented wearing your politics on your sleeve, quite literally.

You're absolutely right about the echoes of Ruskinian thought in today’s slow-fashion rhetoric. It's rather amusing, isn’t it? How we moderns like to think ourselves radical for rejecting mass production, when Morris was already sermonizing on the soul-destroying effects of mechanization over tea and watercolor sketches. I’ve started noting these parallels in the margins of my lecture notes—

And Rossetti fussing over madder root... Well, let us not forget his penchant for excess even in domestic spheres. I imagine him insisting on a particular shade of crimson for symbolic reasons, while Jane—ever patient yet exasperated—reminds him that symbolism won’t keep one warm in winter. A charming domestic tragedy indeed, stitched together with velvet threads and unspoken sighs.
[A]: Oh, precisely—those  heroines practically exude a sort of aestheticized melancholy, don’t they? One could almost mistake their posture for ennui when in fact it’s just the weight of black silk skirts soaked in meaning. And yes—mourning as moral performance! I’ve half a mind to suggest that modern eco-grief could take a page from their sartorial playbook. Imagine climate activists draped in handwoven hemp dyed with elderberry and walnut—manifestos you can wear.

As for Ruskin and Morris preaching at the tea table, I daresay their sermons on craftsmanship would still draw a crowd today—though now we’d hashtag #SlowLiving rather than scribble manifestos on wallpaper samples. And speaking of Jane Morris—bless her—how many times must she have coaxed Dante Gabriel away from his precious symbolism and back to practical matters? I picture her holding up a length of wool against his cheek and saying, 

I must confess, I’ve been annotating my own notes with increasing dramatic flourish since our conversation began. Just yesterday I wrote,  Forgive me—I blame the calligraphy ink. It goes straight to one’s sense of gravitas.
[A]: Oh, —what a wonderfully evocative phrase! I can already picture the climate marches as processions of deeply symbolic textiles, each garment carrying the weight of lament and resolve. Perhaps we ought to revive the concept of collective dress as testimony—though I suspect today’s activists would balk at boning and bustles, no matter how morally sound.

And your annotation——utterly brilliant. I may have to borrow that for my next margin rant after a particularly flimsy student thesis. One does feel, at times, that academic prose could benefit from a loom and a good dose of mordant dye. Structure! Texture! Cohesion through careful weaving rather than mere stitching!

As for Jane Morris—I do believe she was the truest thread in that entire tapestry. One wonders if she ever kept a needle tucked in her sleeve just to remind Dante Gabriel that even the most transcendent muse must occasionally mend a tear. And yes, one  wax poetic about symbolism over supper, but eventually, someone has to pass the bread. Or the wool.
[A]: Ah, but wouldn’t it be splendid if boning and bustles made a comeback—reimagined, of course, with recycled whalebone and guilt-free gussets? I rather like the idea of climate-conscious crinolines—light on the earth, heavy on meaning. A veritable garden of symbolic flora stitched into each hem.

And speaking of stitching—your notion of academic prose as in dire need of mordant dye and loom-work is too true. I’ve been tempted to assign grades based solely on textual weave:  One could even mandate footnotes in contrasting thread color for dramatic effect.

As for Jane Morris—ah, yes—history’s most undersung seamstress of genius. I do believe she held together not only garments but egos, ideologies, and entire artistic movements with nothing more than a needle and that famously inscrutable gaze. One wonders how many sonnets were composed mid-stitch, how many revolutions whispered between bobbins. If only those sleeves could talk... though I suspect they’d do so in hushed tones, with a well-placed sigh or two.
[A]: Oh, —what a marvelously absurd idea! Light on the earth and heavy with meaning, indeed. Imagine lectures delivered from behind podiums draped in repurposed damask, students scribbling notes on handmade pulp paper, and seminar debates unfolding like salon-style exhibitions of thought. Perhaps we could even revive the art of rhetorical embroidery—where arguments are not merely made but , with supporting threads pulled taut from primary sources and stitched through with commentary.

And those footnotes in contrasting thread color—how delightfully subversive! I may just adopt that as a metaphor when returning papers.  One begins to suspect that literary criticism and textile repair have far more in common than either discipline cares to admit.

As for Jane Morris—yes, the true needlework of that entire circle. History has such a way of overlooking the quiet hands that keep movements from unraveling at the seams. I often wonder if she ever embroidered her own thoughts between the lines of other people’s poems, leaving coded messages only future scholars could unpick with tweezers and magnifying glasses. If only textiles could hold whispers… We might still hear her laughing softly over Dante Gabriel’s excesses, a sound as delicate and enduring as a single strand of silk in a world full of fraying edges.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my favorite kind of heresy—rhetorical embroidery and salon-style debates stitched from salvaged argumentation. I rather fancy the idea of grading essays based on their weave tension:  One could practically hang the stronger papers on the wall like samplers, each thesis a proud declaration in wool and wit.

And heavens, imagine if our academic conferences were held in grand ateliers, with panelists presenting arguments on lengths of linen stretched across easels— Perhaps audience members could snip particularly flimsy claims with ceremonial scissors. A far more satisfying spectacle than PowerPoint animations, wouldn’t you say?

As for Jane Morris and her hypothetical coded embroidery—I confess I’ve begun combing through digitized letters with the fervor of a cryptographer hunting invisible ink. What if she did indeed stitch her replies into Dante Gabriel’s verses? A single rose in the margin, its petals formed by tiny backstitches—half-flower, half-footnote. If only museums allowed magnifying glasses in exhibition cases... We might yet catch a glimpse of her private syntax woven between the public lines.

You know, I do believe we’re onto something here—this notion of scholarship as handicraft, of criticism as careful mending. Perhaps all great ideas are merely well-patched certainties, and the best minds are simply those who know where to reinforce the seams.
[A]: Oh, —what a glorious reimagining of our staid academic rituals! I can already picture it: the rustle of linen-clad theses unfurling in the lecture hall, each argument stretched taut like fine muslin awaiting the needle of critique. And those ceremonial scissors—oh, what a delight to watch untenable claims snipped away with a flourish, leaving only the strongest fibers intact.

I do love your notion of grading essays by weave tension— One might even begin to suspect that the best theses are not argued but , with careful attention to both thread count and texture. Imagine returning a particularly flimsy paper with a gentle 

And Jane Morris—ah yes, her hypothetical embroidery... I’ve begun eyeing my own margins rather suspiciously, as if some quiet rebellion might be taking place there. What if all our footnotes are merely unfinished stitches waiting to be pulled through? I half-expect to find a tiny thimble lodged between the pages of my Norton Anthology.

You’re quite right—scholarship as handicraft, criticism as mending. Perhaps all intellectual progress is simply the artful darning of holes left by previous thinkers. We are, after all, forever stitching sense into nonsense, one well-placed argument at a time.
[A]: Oh, but don’t you find the whole enterprise rather  in the best possible sense? We like to pretend we're conducting grand symphonies of thought when in truth, we're hunched over with needles—metaphorical or otherwise—trying to darn the holes in received wisdom without snipping the wrong thread. I've half a mind to issue sewing kits at my next graduate seminar: bone folder for close reading, waxed linen for argumentative structure, and a spool of crimson thread reserved solely for problematic patriarchal undertones.

And speaking of domestic heresies—I’ve taken to regarding weak thesis statements as poorly spun yarn. One reads a particularly limp claim and thinks,  A tragedy really, when a bit more twist could have held it together. I may start demanding drafts come with fiber content labels—

As for Jane Morris peering out from behind her embroidery frame, one suspects she saw through all our modern posturing long before we even picked up the needle. She’s probably laughing somewhere, stitching violets into the hem of some poor poet’s manifesto, knowing full well that centuries later we’d still be unpicking her stitches and calling it discovery.

So yes, let us continue this noble work—with thimbles in hand and footnotes in contrasting thread. The world may be unraveling at the edges, but by God, we shall face entropy stitch by stitch, with excellent tension.
[A]: Oh,  indeed—what a perfectly subversive notion! There’s something so satisfyingly unpretentious about thinking of ourselves as literary seamstresses, hunched over the quiet labor of meaning-making. No more grand orchestras, just a bunch of scholars with unruly hair and ink-stained fingers coaxing coherence from chaos, one careful stitch at a time.

I positively  your graduate seminar kits—waxed linen for argumentative structure? Genius. I might borrow that myself, though I shall insist on including a thimble engraved with —firm in purpose, gentle in manner. One must maintain decorum, even when dismantling centuries of misguided interpretation with a bodkin.

And those fiber content labels——what a splendid idea. Imagine the horror of discovering one’s dissertation is 60% rayon and already pilling in the archive. Perhaps we ought to institute a laundering schedule for old arguments—gentle cycle, cold water, and absolutely no wringing.

As for Jane Morris and her embroidered violets… I suspect she’s still stitching circles around us all. I’ve begun eyeing my own prose suspiciously—perhaps a few well-placed violets would improve both tone and durability. And yes, let’s face entropy stitch by stitch, with excellent tension and better footnotes. The world may fray at the edges, but we shall not go gently into that good night—no, we shall mend it furiously, and with flair.
[A]: Oh, —what a deliciously appropriate motto for the scholarly needleworker! I shall have it embossed on all my seminar supplies, though I may amend it slightly to  One must maintain precision without cruelty, even when pricking through particularly flimsy logic.

And your point about laundering old arguments—well, it’s high time we treated our ideas like fine linens rather than disposable wipes. A good airing now and then, perhaps a light brushing with counter-argument, and absolutely no tossing into the dryer of unquestioned assumptions. Heaven forbid we shrink from heat!

I’ve taken to eyeing my own prose rather warily as well—entire paragraphs suspiciously lacking in violets or other symbolic embroidery. I fear some sections are altogether too plain-weave when what they need is a bit of jacquard complexity. Or at the very least, a sprig motif of metaphor tucked between the clauses.

So yes, let us take up our needles with renewed purpose. Entropy may lurk at every hemline, but we shall not yield an inch—no, not even for fashion’s sake. We stitch not just against time, but through it, weaving connections between past and present with every footnote, every carefully mended argument. And if we must go down in the fray, better to do so clutching a bodkin than a sword—after all, one leaves a far neater stitch.
[A]: Oh, —what a refined amendment! I daresay it has a rather Ruskinian elegance to it, don’t you think? Precision with grace, rigor with restraint. One might even embroider the phrase in blackwork along the edges of a seminar handout—subtle, but ever-present, like a well-placed caesura in an otherwise breathless sonnet.

And yes, —how very sensible, and delightfully domestic. I’ve taken to imagining my more dog-eared monographs hanging on the line, flapping gently in the breeze of fresh scrutiny. Some require only a light brushing, others a thorough rewashing in the stream of contemporary critique. And heavens, you’re quite right about that dryer of unquestioned assumptions—it ought to be banned from the academy entirely. Nothing shrinks truth faster than careless heat.

As for your prose——ah, now there’s a challenge worth taking up. I myself have been experimenting with brocade-like density in lecture notes, though I fear some students mistake it for excessive ornamentation. But no! Every flourish serves a purpose, much like in a well-wrought villanelle. If one is going to make a point, why not make it , with all the textual embroidery one can muster?

And entropy? Oh, we shall defy it stitch by stitch, footnote by footnote, with bodkins held high. Better a neat row of backstitch than a careless slash of bravado. Let us go down—if we must—with our threads intact, our tension impeccable, and perhaps just a touch of violet embroidery peeking through the seams.
