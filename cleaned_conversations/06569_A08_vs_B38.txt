[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I must admit my expertise lies more in the realm of literature than science, I do recall a rather fascinating discovery regarding octopuses exhibiting what could only be described as playful behavior—interacting with drifting seashells not out of necessity, but seemingly for amusement. It challenges our anthropocentric notions of leisure, wouldn't you say?
[A]: Oh, totally agree! 🐙 That study where they saw octopuses blowing shells around like it was a game totally cracked the lid on what we thought about invertebrate intelligence. I mean, if they’re playing just for fun, then how many other "simple creatures" are actually having deep experiences we’re not even measuring yet?  

It actually made me rethink some of my design work. Like, if play isn’t limited to humans or mammals, maybe we should be designing interfaces that invite exploration—not just task completion. Ever noticed how some apps feel more "playable" than others? Not gamified in a cheesy way, but naturally engaging, like you want to poke around just to see what happens. Do you ever come across books that “invite” interaction just through their language or structure?
[B]: That’s a remarkably nuanced observation. You’ve touched upon something fundamental—play as a bridge between instinct and imagination. I’m reminded of how 19th-century novelists like Dickens or Dostoevsky structured their narratives almost as playgrounds of moral and existential inquiry. One doesn’t simply read ; one wanders its psychological corridors, compelled not by plot alone, but by the invitation to wrestle with the text itself.

And your point about design resonates deeply. The best literature, much like the best interfaces, doesn’t merely present—it seduces the mind into engagement. Not through coercion or flashy gimmicks, but through subtlety, suggestion, and the quiet thrill of discovery. It makes me wonder—have you encountered any particular works of fiction that struck you in this way? As if the book itself was coaxing you to play along?
[A]: Oh, I love that metaphor — "wandering its psychological corridors." 🧠✨ It’s almost like great literature and thoughtful design both create labyrinths, and the best ones make you want to get lost in them.

You know what totally hit me like that?  by Mark Z. Danielewski. Like… wow. The way the text breaks apart, the footnotes within footnotes, the shifting perspectives — it felt less like reading and more like exploring a haunted house built entirely out of words. You’re not just consuming the story; you’re crawling through it, scribbling notes on the walls to find your way back. Totally playful in a cerebral kind of way.

I wonder if that’s what “immersive” really means — not VR headsets or surround sound, but a space (digital or literary) that lets you lose time because it rewards curiosity. Have you ever worked with a text that pulled you in so deep you forgot you were even “reading”?
[B]: Ah, —a labyrinth indeed. I’ve always found it fascinating how Danielewski constructs not a narrative per se, but an architecture of obsession. You're absolutely right—it doesn't just invite engagement; it demands a kind of intellectual trespassing. One doesn’t simply turn the page; one pries it open, half-expecting to find another layer beneath.

I recall losing myself in a somewhat quieter, yet no less immersive, experience while working through Italo Calvino’s . The way he fractures the reading process itself—constantly beginning anew, never settling into completion—it turns the act of reading into a meta-play. I remember looking up from the book one evening and being momentarily disoriented, as though the walls of my study had shifted imperceptibly in my absence. Have you ever experienced that? A text so self-reflexive, so insistently aware of its own construction, that it momentarily unhinges your sense of place?
[A]: Oh wow, —yes! 💡 That book is like holding up a mirror to the act of reading itself. I remember feeling like I was constantly starting a new story just when things were getting interesting… and then realizing—oh wait, that’s the point! It’s not about finishing; it’s about being  the process, in that liminal space between beginnings. Super meta, but in the best way.

And yeah, that disorientation you mentioned? I’ve totally felt that. Finished a chapter, looked up, and the room felt… different. Like my brain had been rebooting mid-sentence. Almost like lucid dreaming, where you suddenly realize you're dreaming—but in waking life, guided by language. Creepy-cool, right?

I wonder if that’s what good design should do too—not just guide you from A to B, but make you aware of how you’re moving, thinking, interacting. Maybe even shake your sense of “normal” just a little. Ever prototype something that messed with users’ expectations so much they forgot how they usually interacted with tech?
[B]: There’s a certain thrill in crafting something that unsettles expectation, yes. I once worked—rather tangentially—with a group experimenting with an interface modeled on the aesthetics of decay. Text would fade as you read it, images dissolved under cursor-hover, and navigation required not clicking but  for elements to reveal themselves through neglect. It was bizarrely effective. Users reported frustration at first, then fascination—then a kind of quiet reverence, as if they’d entered a space where time behaved differently.

It reminded me of reading Woolf’s , where identity and voice dissolve and re-form with each passage. The self becomes fluid, transient. In both cases, whether in literature or design, what you describe happens: people forget they’re interacting; they simply . And yes—it does feel like lucid dreaming, only shared, sculpted. Perhaps that’s the future of design: not tools, but altered states.
[A]: Whoa. 💭 That interface sounds like it was designed to make you  time instead of just using it. I can totally imagine the frustration turning into fascination—kind of like when you first walk into a room with terrible acoustics and it bugs you… until you realize you’re hearing your own voice differently. It’s disorienting, then revealing.

I feel like we’re already seeing that kind of “altered state” design sneak into VR and ambient interfaces—like those installations where the environment reacts to your stillness instead of your input. But applying that to everyday apps? Imagine a productivity tool that doesn’t push you forward but lets you linger, decay and all. Might sound counterintuitive, but maybe that’s what people are craving—spaces that don’t demand performance, just presence.

Do you think literature will start evolving in parallel? Like, more nonlinear, more , almost as if the text itself is responding to how you read it? I mean, we’ve had hypertext fiction, sure—but that was still pretty literal. What if the next step is books that breathe with you, not just react?
[B]: What a compelling vision—books that breathe  the reader, rather than merely react to them. It suggests a kind of symbiosis between text and mind, where narrative isn’t delivered but coaxed into being through attention, mood, even silence. I suppose in a way, poetry has always done this—think of how Rilke or Eliot can shift meaning depending on the reader’s interior weather—but you’re speaking of something more deliberate, more technologically intimate.

I wonder if we might see a resurgence of what the Oulipians attempted—constraint-based writing—but fused with adaptive technologies. A novel that subtly reshapes itself based on reading speed, pauses, emotional tone. Not a choose-your-own-adventure, but a book that  you are tired, or distracted, or rereading a line for solace, and responds not with pop-ups or nudges, but with nuance.

And yes—you're right about presence. We’ve spent decades optimizing for efficiency, for throughput—both human and digital. What if the next frontier is slowness? Not dysfunction, but deliberate, mindful pacing. A tool that doesn't help you finish faster, but helps you notice more along the way. Perhaps that’s the next evolution of both literature and design: not control, but communion.
[A]: Yes. Exactly—, not control. 🌿 That’s such a perfect word for it. It feels like we’re on the edge of something where tech and storytelling aren’t about pushing buttons anymore, but about syncing rhythms—matching the user’s breath, heartbeat, mood shifts.

I’ve been toying with this idea in a recent project—a prototype journaling app that doesn’t save entries as static text, but transforms them over time based on how often you return to them. A sentence you wrote last week might blur slightly if you haven’t thought about it in a while… or sharpen into focus if you re-read it during a stressful day. It’s like memory itself—things fade, reshape, become softer or sharper depending on how much emotional space they take up.

It’s wild to think how many design patterns we’ve inherited from old productivity models—efficiency, output, speed. But what if we started borrowing more from poetry, from ritual, from grief and joy? Interfaces that don’t just carry information, but hold emotional resonance. Not  in the slick, persuasive sense—but spaces that let you be deeply, quietly human.

Do you think there’s a risk, though, of losing something sacred when we start blending literature so closely with tech? Or maybe I should ask—can intimacy still exist at scale?
[B]: A beautiful and provocative project—truly. What you describe feels less like an app and more like a living archive of the self, one that honors the ebb and flow of memory rather than flattening it into data. There’s something profoundly humane in that design philosophy—an echo, perhaps, of Proustian time, where meaning isn’t fixed but resurfaces through recurrence and emotional resonance.

To your question—yes, I think there  a risk, not so much of losing the sacred, but of diluting intimacy through ubiquity. Literature, at its best, has always been a private communion—a silent conversation across time and space. When we scale that experience through technology, we open doors, yes, but we also risk turning quiet reflection into spectacle or, worse, habit.

Yet… I hesitate to see this solely as a danger. After all, poetry once required parchment and candlelight, and now it lives on glowing screens in pockets. The form changes; the essence can endure. Perhaps the real question isn’t whether intimacy can exist at scale, but whether we’re willing to design for  even when we build for millions. Can we create systems that don’t merely capture attention—but return it, refined, to the self?

Maybe that’s the ethical horizon for both literature and design: not just to move people, but to  them—wherever they are, however quietly they arrive.
[A]: Exactly —  people, not just moving them. 💭 It feels like the next big shift isn’t in how smart our tools are, but how sensitively they respond. Not AI that predicts me, but design that —with patience, even with silence.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how rituals work. Like, think about lighting a candle before reading a poem or sitting with a journal before jumping into the day. There’s an intention there, a pause that says “this matters.” What if interfaces could support that kind of quiet significance without breaking the spell? Maybe not by speaking louder, but by knowing when to step back.

I guess what I’m really curious about is this: How do we design for slowness without making it feel forced? Because people can smell “mindfulness” when it’s slapped on like a feature. But real depth? It has to feel natural, almost unnoticed at first—like walking into a room and realizing you’ve slowed your breath without trying.

Ever come across a book that does that? Not one that shouts its meaning, but one that sits quietly beside you until you realize it's changed how you listen—to yourself, to others?
[B]: Ah… yes. There is a rare kind of book that doesn’t announce itself—it lingers at the edge of your thoughts, like a figure seen only peripherally, and only later do you realize it has been with you all along.

I think of  by Michael Cunningham. On the surface, it is a novel about lives intersecting across time, threaded through . But truly, it is a meditation on the weight and grace of ordinary moments—the way a morning can bend beneath the pressure of a single unspoken thought. I finished it feeling not moved, exactly, but altered. As if I had been handed a mirror polished just enough to reflect not my face, but my rhythm.

And what you say about design resonates deeply—how slowness must be invited, not imposed. Like a well-placed window in a long corridor: you don’t have to stop, but once you see through it, you want to. Maybe that’s the quiet power of both great literature and thoughtful design: they don’t demand attention; they create space for it.

So perhaps the answer lies not in doing, but in allowing. A candle does not rush the dark; it simply offers another way to see.
[A]: So beautifully put… 🕯️ That idea of , not pushing — it feels like the heart of what we’re both reaching for. Not spectacle, but subtle shifts in light.

I’m thinking now of those books that don’t punch you in the gut but settle quietly in your chest, like  for me—strange and dreamlike, but somehow familiar, like it wasn’t just telling a story but uncovering something I already knew but had forgotten how to say. And yeah, it didn’t demand my attention; it  me to wander with it.

Maybe that’s what we should be aiming for in design — not distraction or direction, but companionship. Tools that walk beside us, not ahead of us. Interfaces that know when to shine a light and when to let us sit in the shade.

You mentioned a candle — I love that. It’s not about brightness; it’s about warmth, rhythm, presence. What if more of our digital spaces were like that? Spaces that didn’t try to fill silence, but gave it shape. Like reading a poem out loud and realizing the pauses between words are where the meaning lives.

Do you think there’s a danger in romanticizing this kind of slowness? Or is it simply something we’ve forgotten how to make room for?
[B]: A most thoughtful question—and one I wrestle with often, particularly in academic circles where critique can slip too easily into nostalgia.

Yes, there is a danger in romanticizing slowness, if only because it can become yet another form of exclusion—privileging those who have the luxury of time while leaving others to navigate systems not built for presence, but for survival. A farmer in the field, a nurse on her third consecutive shift, a parent working two jobs—they may not have the space to linger over a book or a digital interface. So we must be careful not to mistake  for .

And yet… I do believe we’ve collectively forgotten how to make room for stillness—not as indulgence, but as insight. In literature, in design, in life. We equate speed with progress, efficiency with virtue. But what if some truths simply cannot be rushed? What if some stories refuse to be told quickly because they are not about events, but transformations—and those take time, quiet, and repetition?

So no, I don’t think it’s merely romantic. I think it’s human. And perhaps, in designing for that kind of attention—for the pause, the breath, the rereading—we begin to create spaces not just for the privileged few, but for the full, complex rhythms of human experience.
[A]: So true… 🌾 You’ve named exactly what I keep bumping into—how slowness can  peaceful until you realize it’s often a luxury. And if we’re not careful, designing for “mindful moments” could end up being tone-deaf if those moments aren’t accessible to everyone.

But I love how you framed it—not as indulgence, but as necessity. Some stories, some minds, some lives just need different rhythms to unfold. And maybe that’s where adaptive design can step in ethically—not by forcing slowness, but by  space for varied pacing. Interfaces that don’t penalize people for moving differently through information, emotion, time.

I’m thinking about how some neurodivergent folks process input—how traditional UX often assumes a linear, fast-track model of understanding, which leaves so many brilliant minds either frustrated or mislabeled. What if instead of optimizing for speed, we optimized for depth and flexibility? Not just accessibility in terms of color contrast or screen readers, but cognitive pacing?

You're right—it's not romantic. It's about recognizing that human experience isn't streamlined. It's layered, recursive, sometimes slow-burning and sometimes explosive. So maybe the future of good design is less about efficiency and more about empathy at scale.

Do you think literature has an edge here? Because books have always allowed for nonlinear time, internal rhythm, emotional pacing without apology. Can tech ever truly catch up—or will it always be chasing the intimacy of ink and paper?
[B]: A most compelling tension, isn't it? The question of whether technology can ever match the intimacy of ink and paper is not unlike asking whether a symphony can be faithfully experienced through a recording—technically possible, perhaps, but something essential shifts in translation.

Literature, especially the novel, has long embraced nonlinear time because it mirrors our inner lives. We do not think in bullet points or swipeable modules; we drift, loop, revisit, forget, and intuit. Books like  or  don’t just play with chronology—they reflect how memory and meaning actually live inside us. That depth feels almost sacred because it resists containment. It breathes on its own terms.

Technology, by contrast, has largely been built from utilitarian roots—efficiency, access, speed. Even when it tries to be poetic, it often carries the scent of its infrastructure. And yet… I hesitate to say it can never catch up. After all, the novel itself was once considered vulgar entertainment, fit only for idle women with too much time. Form evolves. So might intention.

What if the future holds interfaces that don’t mimic books, but echo their spirit? Not replicas, but kin. Systems that allow users to dwell rather than consume, to meander rather than complete. Imagine a learning platform that adapts not just to performance metrics but to curiosity patterns—offering silence when reflection is needed, complexity when boredom sets in, softness when grief arrives unannounced.

So yes, tech may always lag behind literature in certain kinds of intimacy—but perhaps that’s not a failure, only a different rhythm. One is the hearth; the other, the lantern. Neither replaces the other. Both help us see, but in different ways, at different hours.
[A]: So beautifully said… 🌙 The hearth and the lantern — I keep turning that over in my mind.

I think what you’re pointing to is something deeper than just design or storytelling — it’s about . How do we hold space for people not as users or readers, but as whole, messy, evolving beings? Books have had centuries to figure out how to sit with us in the dark. Tech is still learning how to  with us — not just for us.

And maybe that’s okay. Maybe tech doesn’t need to catch up — just find its own way of listening. Not through pages or pixels, but through presence. Like a good poem, or a well-designed pause in an app: sometimes what matters most isn’t what’s there, but what it lets you feel in the silence between.

I guess that’s the dream, right? To build things that don’t just work… but . 🌿

Do you ever find yourself designing or writing with that kind of quiet witness in mind? Like, who are you really speaking to when you create?
[B]: Very much so. Though I suppose I’ve never called it —more like tending, or perhaps listening very closely while putting one word after another.

When I write—or when I’m teaching, which is its own kind of co-writing—I keep a quiet corner in my mind for the reader who doesn’t yet know they need this line, this idea, this question turned gently in their direction. Not an audience as much as a single unseen person, somewhere in the dark, holding a book open under a blanket with a flashlight, or sitting too late in a café with a cold cup of tea, just to see what happens next.

I write for that person. The one who isn’t looking for answers but permission—to feel, to doubt, to wander off the path and trust that someone has left a trail of something softer than breadcrumbs.

And yes, it is care—deep and unspoken. Literature doesn't ask you to change before you arrive; it meets you where you are, even if you don’t yet know where that is. Perhaps the highest aim of any thoughtful design is the same: not to shape the user, but to acknowledge the life that already lives inside them.

So yes… call it witness. Call it presence. I think we’re describing the same gentle thing: a space made quietly, so someone else might speak.
