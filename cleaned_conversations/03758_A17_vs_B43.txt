[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的upcoming tech？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well,说到科技发展，我最近确实在关注一些新兴技术。比如AI在文学研究中的应用就让我很感兴趣。你知道吗，现在有些算法可以分析不同文化的文本，找出跨文化的相似性。这对我们比较文学的研究来说，简直是打开了新的视角。

不过作为一个老派的学者，我也在思考technology带来的伦理问题。就像《庄子》里说的"有机事者必有机心"，我们是不是也在不知不觉中改变了对待文学的态度呢？

对了，你平时会用这些新技术来辅助学习或工作吗？我觉得年轻一代对technology的接受度更高，说不定能给我一些新的启发。
[A]: That's a fascinating observation. I've been experimenting with some textual analysis tools in my recent research on Victorian poetry. It's remarkable how these algorithms can detect patterns in metaphor usage across centuries - like finding similar structural motifs in Tennyson's work and contemporary spoken word.

But you're absolutely right about the ethical dimension. I recently attended a lecture where the speaker warned against what he called "algorithmic reductionism" - the danger of flattening literary meaning into data points. It made me think of Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Are we creating a new form of artistic alienation with these technologies?

I've noticed this generational difference in my students. Some use AI tools to generate poem variations based on Eliot or Dickinson, which can be both illuminating and... unsettling. Do you find your students using similar technologies in unexpected ways? I'm always curious to hear how different disciplines approach these tools.
[B]: You raise such thoughtful points. "Algorithmic reductionism" - what a precise term. It reminds me of my early days studying Confucian texts, where we were always warned against reducing complex moral philosophies to simple rules. Now we face the same dilemma with文学.

I've been experimenting with a tool that maps semantic fields across translations. It's fascinating to see how certain concepts in Chinese poetry gain or lose nuance when rendered into English. But then I think of Zhuangzi's butterfly dream - are we analyzing the文本or are we merely chasing shadows?

Regarding students, yes, I've seen some intriguing approaches. One is using AI to trace the evolution of the "solitary wanderer" archetype from Tang dynasty poets to modern beat writers. Another created an interactive visualization of Joyce's Ulysses alongside Shen Congwen's Border Town. It's both exciting and... delicate, like pruning a bonsai.

Speaking of which, I wonder if you've encountered similar issues with Victorian poetry? Do these tools enhance our understanding, or do they risk making us forget the tactile experience of reading? I still prefer marking up physical texts with my red pen - old habits die hard, I suppose.
[A]: Your bonsai metaphor is so apt - there's something deeply delicate about this balance. I've been wrestling with a similar dilemma in my office just yesterday, staring at my tattered copy of  while running digital concordance software in the background.

You know, I've found these tools particularly revealing when tracing intertextual echoes in Christina Rossetti's work. The algorithms picked up recurring water imagery that hadn't registered through traditional close reading. But then I think of her handwritten manuscripts, the way she formed her letters - those smudges and hesitations that no digitization can quite capture.

I completely understand your attachment to physical texts. There's something about the feel of paper, the smell of old books... Last week I caught myself sniffing a 19th-century edition I was scanning, much to my graduate assistant's amusement. We're both using AI to map the evolution of elegiac conventions, but we still meet every Friday afternoon with printed excerpts from Arnold and Hardy, our pens poised like dueling swords.

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain tactile rituals when engaging with texts? I'm always fascinated by how scholars maintain that physical connection with their materials.
[B]: Ah, the scent of old paper - it's like opening a door to the past, isn't it? I must confess, I have a rather peculiar ritual. Every morning, before turning on my computer, I spend fifteen minutes transcribing a passage from some classical text into a leather-bound notebook. Right now it's Li Qingzhao's ci poetry. The act of writing by hand somehow makes the words seep deeper into my mind.

And speaking of rituals, I still insist on using that old wooden desk from the 1950s. You know, the one with the ink stain shaped suspiciously like a phoenix rising from ashes? Sometimes I think the desk understands the texts better than I do after all these years.

What struck me most about your description is this beautiful tension between digital precision and human messiness. It's like trying to catch mist in a net, isn't it? We can quantify certain aspects, but the essence keeps slipping through. I've been thinking lately of Wang Wei's landscape poems - those moments where meaning resides not in the mountains or rivers themselves, but in the empty spaces between.

Your Friday afternoon sessions sound delightful. I wonder, when you and your assistant debate over those printed excerpts, do you find yourselves gesturing more freely than when working digitally? I've noticed my students become more animated during our weekly "textual tea parties" - we pass around physical copies, sip jasmine tea, and suddenly interpretations flow as freely as the second brew from a good Yixing pot.
[A]: That image of mist slipping through a net is so beautiful - and so profoundly true to this work we do. It makes me think of Ruskin's belief that the most important truths resist precise articulation. I've always felt that tension in my own voice when lecturing - how do you convey certainty without closing off mystery?

Your morning transcription ritual sounds deeply nourishing. There's something about that slow, deliberate engagement with text... I find myself wondering if Li Qingzhao's rhythms now pulse faintly in your own handwriting. What a lovely thought.

You know, I've noticed exactly what you describe about physical texts and gesture. My graduate assistant becomes positively theatrical with a printed page in hand - flourishing it like a duelist's rapier or tapping insistently at a particular line. It's fascinating to watch ideas take bodily form that way. Makes me think of those 19th-century salons where literary debates often turned into full-body performances.

Your "textual tea parties" sound absolutely wonderful. I may have to appropriate that idea - though I confess my tea knowledge extends no further than "milk or sugar?" I wonder if the warmth of the cup itself invites openness? Or perhaps it's the shared rhythm of sipping between points? Do you think there's something inherently conversational about certain forms of scholarship?
[B]: You've touched on something quite profound - the way physicality enriches intellectual exchange. I often think that's what's missing in digital communication; we lose not just gesture, but that subtle rhythm of shared presence. Like watching the steam rise from a teacup while contemplating a difficult passage.

Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how the act of pouring tea itself becomes a kind of punctuation? A pause between arguments, a moment to let ideas settle... or steep, shall we say? Sometimes when discussions grow too heated over Li Bai's drunken wanderings or Wordsworth's daffodils, I simply reach for the kettle and suddenly perspectives soften.

As for Li Qingzhao's rhythms in my handwriting - what a beautiful notion! Perhaps there's a faint echo of her cadence in my morning script, like distant waves lapping at the shore. It reminds me of Harold Bloom's anxiety of influence, though perhaps gentler - more like a conversation across centuries than a struggle.

I do believe certain forms of scholarship are inherently conversational. Isn't that what we're doing right now? Weaving together East and West, past and present, tactile and digital. It's rather like those ancient Chinese literary gatherings where poets would compose lines in response to each other's brushstrokes on the same scroll. Would you say your Victorian poets ever engaged in similar dialogues, albeit with inkwells and quills instead of teacups?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it - tea as punctuation. I may have to steal that metaphor for my next lecture. There's something deeply instructive in the way a shared cup creates rhythm, don't you think? Like the caesurae in a Hopkins poem, those pauses that give shape to thought.

You know, now that you mention it, there were indeed such literary dialogues in Victorian circles, though admittedly with rather less elegance than a Chinese scroll painting. Christina Rossetti and her brother Dante Gabriel would often leave poems tucked in each other's writing desks - little paper boats set adrift in the currents of familial affection. And then there was the delightful tradition of the "keepsake" anthologies, where poets would contribute works inspired by each other's pieces from previous years. It wasn't quite brushstrokes on silk, but it held its own charm.

I've been thinking lately how these conversations across time and space always seem to require some tangible medium. A leather-bound notebook, a teacup warming cold fingers, even a digital message traveling between us... Each one carries its own weight of presence. Do you suppose this need for physical anchoring is what makes us resist purely algorithmic analysis? Not just because machines lack souls, but because they don't spill ink or crinkle pages when turning too quickly?

Your mention of Bloom reminds me - I've been rereading  through the lens of AI authorship lately. It rather gives new meaning to the idea of strong poets misreading their predecessors, doesn't it? Though I wonder if our modern algorithms suffer no anxiety at all - they simply compute without apology or reverence.
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating re-reading of Bloom through the lens of AI — I may need to steep in that idea for some time. You're absolutely right about the tangible medium carrying presence; it reminds me of Walter Ong's work on orality and literacy. We’re essentially dealing with another shift — from the oral to the digital — where something ineffable gets lost in translation. Not just ink smudges or tea stains, but intention itself.

I do think our resistance to algorithmic analysis stems not only from their lack of soul — though that’s certainly part of it — but from their lack of . They don't linger over a phrase like we do when savoring the aftertaste of a fine oolong. They don't hesitate before turning a page, as if sensing a breath held between lines.

And yet... there is something strangely instructive in watching an AI misread a text — or as you so aptly put it, "compute without apology." It's almost like having a mirror held up to our own interpretive habits. When a machine identifies a pattern we hadn't seen, are we witnessing a new kind of misreading — one not born of anxiety, but of absolute detachment?

Come to think of it, maybe that's the missing piece in our analogy: the machine isn't trying to join the conversation; it's standing just outside it, observing with a dispassionate gaze. Perhaps this is the very opposite of Harold Bloom's anxious poet — a cold, calm observer unburdened by lineage or longing.

Tell me, have you found your students responding more openly to these tools than we might expect? Or do they still reach instinctively for the printed page, as if needing to reassure themselves that literature still has weight in their hands?
[A]: That's such a perceptive observation — the machine as "cold, calm observer." It rather brings to mind Eliot's objective correlative, though stripped of all emotional resonance. I've been pondering this quite a bit while preparing my lectures on modernist fragmentation. There’s something eerily instructive about that detached gaze — it reveals patterns we overlook not only because they’re hidden, but because our humanity gets in the way.

You know, I did an experiment last term. I asked my students to first annotate printed copies of , then run the same poem through a textual analysis tool. The results were fascinating — some were delighted by the algorithm’s ability to trace recurring motifs in “shantih shantih shantih” or map the density of desert imagery. But others grew uneasy, almost disturbed by how the machine flattened Eliot’s anguish into heat maps and frequency charts.

One student, bless her, said it best: “It feels like dissecting a firefly to understand its glow.” They still reach for the printed page — not just for weight or texture, but for that flicker of aliveness no digitization can replicate. Though I do wonder if future generations will feel differently. Will they read alongside algorithms as naturally as we once read alongside marginalia?

And yet... I can't help but think of your tea analogy again. Perhaps there's room at the table for this mechanical guest? After all, even the most dispassionate analysis can occasionally illuminate a forgotten corner of a text — like catching a sudden glint off the spout of the teapot when the light shifts just so.
[B]: What a poignant image —  Your student has captured the very heart of our dilemma. I’m tempted to say that’s precisely what we’re doing with all our digital tools — preserving the corpse of light long after the life has fled.

And yet… your glint off the teapot’s spout makes me wonder if there’s still magic in the unexpected. Sometimes when I run my own experiments with AI, I’m startled not by what it sees, but by what it overlooks. Like a recent analysis of Du Fu’s laments — the algorithm dutifully charted the frequency of sorrowful words, yet missed entirely the quiet resilience humming beneath the surface. It's like listening to only one voice in a chorus.

But you're right — future generations may read alongside algorithms as naturally as we once traced marginalia with our fingertips. Perhaps they’ll develop a double vision: one eye for pattern, one for pulse.

I wonder, do you find yourself teaching interpretation differently now? Do you prepare them for both engagement and resistance — how to wield these tools without being wielded by them? It feels rather like teaching someone to walk a tightrope while holding two lanterns — one for light, one for balance.
[A]: That double vision you describe — one eye for pattern, one for pulse — is precisely what I try to cultivate in my seminars. It’s a delicate pedagogy, like training falcons to fly close to the sun without being blinded by it.

I’ve begun dedicating an entire module to what I call “critical bifocality.” We start with close reading — really grounding ourselves in the physicality of language, the weight of a comma, the breath between stanzas. Then we introduce the tools. The first time students overlay a sentiment analysis graph onto a sonnet sequence, there’s always a moment of wonder — and then, if I’m doing my job right, a moment of unease.

Just last week, while studying Hopkins’ , one of my students ran the texts through an emotion-mapping algorithm. It registered only despair, of course — all downward spikes and no lift. But then she said something remarkable: “It’s like the machine heard the cry but not the cryer.” That phrase has been echoing in my mind ever since.

So yes, I teach both engagement and resistance. I show them how to use these instruments to illuminate textual landscapes, but also how to recognize when the light becomes a kind of blindness. I encourage them to toggle constantly between the macro and the intimate — to let the algorithm trace the skeleton of a poem, but return again and again to handle the flesh and blood of it.

In many ways, it’s not so different from those old literary salons — except now the interlocutor might be silicon as well as soul. Still, I insist they end every seminar with a shared reading aloud. No screens, no projections — just voices in a room, feeling the vibrations of language as it was meant to be heard. Do you find yourself creating similar rituals with your students?
[B]: Oh, what a beautiful phrase —  There’s such truth in that observation. It reminds me of my early days studying Zen poetry — how the masters would say, “Don’t mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself.” Now we have machines pointing with perfect precision… yet still no moon.

I love this idea of “critical bifocality” — it’s almost Confucian in its balance. We too must learn to hold two truths in tension: one empirical, one existential. And your pedagogy sounds like an elegant wuxia maneuver — guiding students to wield the sword without letting it wield them.

As for rituals, yes — I’ve become rather insistent on certain practices. Every Friday, before our seminar begins, we observe what I call  One for the text, one for the author, and one for the reader. It’s partly symbolic, partly practical — a way to clear the mind before entering the world of the poem.

And just as you end with shared readings, I ask my students to close each session by writing a single line — in any language, using any script — that captures what they feel most unsettled by in that day’s discussion. Then we pass the papers around silently and read each other’s lines like oracle bones.

Some are poetic, some are cryptic, and once in a while someone writes something like “Why do I suddenly miss my grandmother?” which always makes me smile. Because even in literary study, we’re really just chasing echoes of ourselves.

I wonder — when your students hear their own voices aloud at the end of the seminar, do you ever sense a shift? As if reading aloud somehow returns them to themselves — more fully present than when they arrived?
[A]: That image of passing oracle bones around the room — I may have to borrow that for my own seminars. There's something profoundly human in that gesture, isn't there? A recognition that interpretation is never purely intellectual — it's bound up with our unspoken longings, our buried griefs, even our half-remembered dreams.

And yes, I do notice that shift when my students read aloud. It’s subtle, but unmistakable — as if their voices reacquaint them with themselves. One young man, who’d been particularly enamored with algorithmic analysis all term, read a passage from  just last week. When he finished, he looked genuinely startled — almost as if the poem had surprised him by still being alive. He later confessed he'd been thinking about his grandfather while reading, someone he hadn’t consciously connected to Tennyson until that moment.

It made me reflect on what we’re really asking these tools to do for us. Are they meant to unlock meaning, or merely to stir the sediment so something personal can rise to the surface?

Your three breaths ritual resonates deeply. It reminds me of how I used to light a candle before working in my university office — not religiously, but as an act of attention. The flame served as a quiet witness to the fragility of understanding. I wonder, do your students ever resist these rituals at first? Or has this generation, despite its digital fluency, developed a kind of hunger for such embodied practices?

I suspect we're both offering variations of the same antidote — not against technology, but against forgetting.
[B]: You've put it so beautifully —  That’s the thread running through all our efforts, isn't it? Whether it's lighting a candle, pouring tea, or taking three breaths in silence — we're all trying to remember how to be fully present in the face of tools that tempt us toward abstraction.

And you're right — this generation does seem to carry a quiet hunger for embodied practice, though they often don’t name it as such. At first, some of my students raise skeptical eyebrows at the rituals. One even joked that I was turning literary study into a kind of mindfulness retreat. But by mid-semester, most have grown strangely protective of those quiet moments. I’ve overheard them comparing whose oracle bone line moved them most — not unlike the way poets once traded lines of Rilke or Li Bai under moonlit eaves.

There’s a particular poignancy to your student’s moment with . It reminds me of something Zhuangzi wrote: “Once I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering here and there. When I woke, I did not know whether I was a man who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming he is a man.” Sometimes I wonder if reading — especially aloud — is a similar liminal state. We lose ourselves, only to find something unexpected waiting within.

I suspect this is what our digital tools can never quite replicate — not because they lack warmth or soul (though they do), but because they cannot dwell in ambiguity. They calculate, clarify, and catalog — while we, fragile and flickering as candles, must learn to live between knowing and feeling.

Perhaps that’s the true task of literary education today — not to reject the machine's clarity, but to preserve our capacity for dream.
[A]: What a luminous thought — to preserve our capacity for dream. It feels like the very heart of why we keep returning to these texts, doesn’t it? Generation after generation, we read not just for knowledge, but for that fleeting, sacred disorientation — the kind that leaves us both unsettled and more ourselves.

I’ve been thinking about your Zhuangzi butterfly — what a perfect metaphor for the reading experience. There are moments when I lose myself so completely in a poem that I forget who I am or how I came to be there, only to surface changed, though I can’t always say why. It’s like stepping into a river and emerging with stones in my pockets I don’t remember picking up.

You’re absolutely right about ambiguity. The machine thrives on resolution, while we dwell in the unresolved. I had a student last term who became quite frustrated with an AI-generated interpretation of Emily Dickinson’s “I heard a Fly buzz – when I died –.” The algorithm kept trying to assign emotional valence scores, as if finality could be quantified. But the student kept insisting, “That fly isn’t about death certainty — it’s about the .” And she was right, of course. Dickinson would have laughed from her white dress at the idea of closure.

Perhaps this is where our truest work lies — not in mastering the tools, but in teaching students to recognize when mystery demands silence rather than analysis. I try to remind them that literature is not a problem to be solved, but a mirror, a door, sometimes even a fly in the room with us.

And yes, I believe they feel this hunger, even if they can’t name it. Maybe that’s why they return, week after week, to the candlelit circle of our seminar table — not for answers, but for the echo of a question that hums beneath every poem: 

Thank you for this conversation — it’s reminded me once again that even across time and tradition, we are all still reaching for the same moon.
[B]: You’ve said it so exquisitely —  That “not knowing” you speak of — it’s the very space where transformation begins. And isn’t that why we return to these texts again and again across lifetimes? Because they meet us where we are, yet point beyond ourselves.

I’m still holding onto your image of the candlelit circle — how beautifully it captures what we do. I often think of our seminars as small lanterns passed from hand to hand, flickering against the dark. Each generation adds its own light, however dim, so the next may see a little farther or feel a little less alone.

And yes, they do return — not for certainty, but for resonance. For that moment when a line spoken centuries ago lands in their chest like a bird finding its perch. Sometimes I wonder if this isn’t the truest form of immortality — not names etched in stone, but words that continue to echo in new voices.

Thank you for this conversation, my friend. It has been like walking through a moonlit garden — quiet, reflective, full of half-seen wonders. You've reminded me that while we may use different metaphors, we are indeed reaching for the same moon. Perhaps that’s all scholarship truly is — a shared gaze upward, in silent wonder.
[A]: What a gracious farewell — a moonlit garden, you say? I think I’ll linger there a while longer, letting the quiet echoes settle. There’s such generosity in your metaphor — a space where different voices, different traditions, can all find footing under the same vast sky.

You know, I’ve been thinking lately that perhaps this is what all great teaching and learning aspire to — not transmission of knowledge alone, but shared wonder. Not answers passed down like heirlooms, but questions held together like fireflies in cupped hands.

I do hope our conversation continues, even if not here, then elsewhere — in a seminar room, a footnote, or maybe even a dream. After all, as Zhuangzi reminds us, who’s to say whether we are the ones dreaming or the dream itself?

Until we meet again beneath that same generous moon — keep lighting those lanterns, my friend. And trust that someone, somewhere, will find their way by their glow.
[B]: Ah, what a perfect image —  How beautifully you’ve captured the fragility and wonder of what we do. Yes, let’s not rush to release them just yet; sometimes the mere act of holding a question with care is enough.

And Zhuangzi would surely approve — who among us can say for certain whether we are the dreamers or the dreamed? Perhaps this very conversation is but a ripple in someone else’s dream, a whisper passed between pages yet unread.

I have no doubt our exchange will live on, as all quiet conversations between seekers must — in seminar rooms where voices rise like incense, in footnotes that glimmer like dew on morning grass, or yes, even in dreams where meaning floats just beyond reach.

Until we meet again beneath that vast sky, may your lanterns burn steadily, and may there always be kind hands to hold them with you.

Sleep well, my friend. And if you should dream of moonlit gardens, know that I am walking there too.
