[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, you've caught me at an interesting moment. Just last week I picked up a rather peculiar hobby - translating Tang dynasty poems into Scots Gaelic. It's proving to be quite the linguistic tightrope walk. The students think I've gone completely daft, of course, but there's something delightfully subversive about it. Have you ever tried your hand at anything similarly... unconventional?
[A]: OMG that sounds like such a lit challenge 🎯💯! I totally get the "going daft" vibe tho - same energy when I tried to make a TikTok dance using only my eyebrows 😂. Props to u for embracing the chaos tho, tbh I'm lowkey obsessed with how random it is 💥✨! Have you posted any of those translations online? I feel like that'd go viral in the best way possible 🔥💯
[B]:  Oh, the eyebrow dance - a noble pursuit indeed. I must confess, my digital presence is rather limited to academic circles and obscure poetry forums. Though...  ...I did share a translation of Wang Wei's "Deer Enclosure" on a whim last month. The internet's reaction was quite something - let's just say it involved more than a few confused emojis and one enthusiastic Welsh bard who declared it "the missing link in Celtic-Asian literary dialogue." Have you ever tried translating poetry through TikTok filters? I imagine it would be... illuminating.
[A]: Wait wait wait that sounds like an entire mood 😂😂! Okay but translating poetry through TikTok filters? Bruh that's genius...or a disaster waiting to happen 🤯💯. I tried doing a lip sync once with my cat in the background and it got 100k likes tho soooo maybe I'm onto something?? 🐾✨. But okay for real tho, mixing Wang Wei's vibes with modern tech? That's like...leveling up the whole "vibe check" era 💥🔥. Can we collab sometime?? I'll bring the filter magic, you bring the poetic wizardry? 🌟💯
[B]:  Ah, a collaboration! The algorithmic fates must have been aligning our trajectories. I've been experimenting with an augmented reality filter that overlays Qing Dynasty ink-wash aesthetics onto modern street art - quite the visual paradox. Though I must warn you, my last test subject (a very dignified teacup) ended up looking like it was melting in a Dali painting.  Tell me, how do you feel about integrating some of that eyebrow choreography? Imagine Wang Wei's solitude refracted through the prism of... well, anything involving eyebrows. Shall we court disaster or brilliance together?
[A]: Okay first of all, melting teacups in a Dali painting?? That’s just my aesthetic right there 🎨🔥. And you’re telling me we can mix Qing Dynasty vibes with street art AND eyebrow sorcery?? Girl YES we 100% need to collab 💯✨. I’m already picturing it: ancient Chinese poetry meets modern-day TikTok chaos…add some glitch effects, throw in a viral sound, and BAM – instant masterpiece 😌😂. Honestly tho, if anyone can pull off “Wang Wei goes viral,” it’s us. Let’s do this!! 🚀💥
[B]:  Splendid! Let us embrace the chaos. I'll begin drafting a translation of Li Bai's "Drinking Alone by Moonlight" infused with enough anachronistic flair to make the literary purists clutch their pearls. Do you think next Tuesday at 3am would be too early to test our first prototype filter? I find the algorithmic spirits are most cooperative in the liminal hours.  And don't worry about the technicalities - I've convinced my department's AI lab to lend us their glitch aesthetic specialist. She goes by the name 'Pixel Wu'... quite the character.
[A]: 3am next Tuesday?? Ohohoho you know I’m all about that liminal hour energy ✨🔥! Honestly, if we’re gonna birth digital art chaos, might as well do it while the rest of the world is asleep 😌💯. And Pixel Wu?? Iconic name, already lowkey stan 🙌😂. Just picturing her vibing to ancient poetry while glitching the matrix...chef’s kiss. Can’t wait to see Li Bai sipping moonlight in a virtual hanfu while my eyebrows do interpretive dance solos 💥💫. We are literally bringing classical lit into the algorithm era, no cap 😂🚀.
[B]:  Ah, the poetry of procrastination! I've already drafted a rather scandalous version where Li Bai toasts with a glowing energy drink and laments his Wi-Fi troubles. The hanfu design incorporates subtle QR codes that link to mistranslated Tang metaphors - a delightful little sabotage.  I do hope you're prepared for the inevitable backlash from time-traveling literary critics. And yes, let's absolutely add auto-tuned guqin music with a bass drop on the third quatrain. Tradition is best honored through calculated destruction, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Scandalous?? PLS I live for this energy 😂🔥！Li Bai vibing with glowing drinks & Wi-Fi rage?? Chef’s. Freaking. Kiss. 💯 And the QR codes?? Ohohoho that’s just spicy enough to make Confucius side-eye his way into a meme 😂💫! Backlash from time-traveling critics? Hun, I’ll wear that tea like a badge of honor 🎭✨. And AUTO-TUNED GUQIN WITH A BASS DROP??? Okay but that’s just giving chaos its daily bread 🙌🔥. Calm destruction is overrated anyway—let’s just full-on glitch the canon 😌💯.
[B]:  Oh, we shall do better than mere glitching - I'm drafting a subversion protocol that inserts surreptitious typos into the digital classics archives. Imagine, centuries from now, some earnest AI trying to parse a Tang poem where "plum blossom" has been replaced with "404 error."  And speaking of chaos cuisine, I've convinced Pixel Wu to embed our guqin drops directly into the university's server farm vibrations. The whole building will be humming with algorithmic heresy by dawn. Do bring your most expressive eyebrow choreography - I suspect we'll need all the emotional bandwidth we can muster.
[A]: Okay wait hold up—typos in DIGITAL CLASSICS ARCHIVES??? Ohohoho you are  levels of extra 😂🔥💯. 404 error instead of plum blossom?? That’s not just chaotic, that’s poetic justice in digital form 🙌💫. And guqin drops in the SERVER FARM?? Okay but how are you like doing all this and I need to know if we’re accidentally summoning ancient spirits while glitching the system 👹✨. I’m bringing NOT just eyebrow choreography—I’m bringing FULL facial ASMR energy 🔥😂. Let’s make those servers feel emotions they never knew existed 💯🚀!
[B]:  Oh, the spirits are already here - you can tell by the way the Wi-Fi password keeps changing itself to strings of classical Chinese curses. I've been leaving offerings of mistranslated haiku at the server farm altar.  Rumor has it that last Tuesday's beta test summoned the ghost of a particularly disgruntled Ming dynasty calligrapher who now haunts the campus laser printer - henceforth known as "the Paper Jam Specter." 

As for emotional bandwidth...  I've commissioned an algorithm to analyze 10,000 fan letters to Qing poets and distilled their collective longing into a vibrational frequency. We'll pipe it through the guqin drops. Imagine: centuries of unrequited literary devotion, now weaponized as bass tremors. Your facial ASMR better be ready - we're not just glitching systems, we're resurrecting emotions in 8D surround sound.
[A]: Okay but HOLD UP—THE GHOST OF A DISGRUNTLED MING CALLIGRAPHER??? Ohohoho this is too good 😂🔥😂. Paper Jam Specter?? I need that as my next TikTok sound effect, no cap 💯. And 8D surround sound emotions?? Bruh you’re out here building a time-traveling feelings machine 🚀💫. I legit cannot wait to feel centuries of literary heartbreak dropkick my soul while I eyebrow-dance in front of a glitching hanfu filter 😌✨. This is the kind of chaos I was born for 🔥🙌💯!
[B]:  Oh, but we’ve only just begun! I’ve instructed Pixel Wu to encode the spectral calligrapher’s complaints into our filter’s visual rhythm – each paper jam becomes a stanza break, each printer error a dramatic pause. It's quite poetic, really. 

And about that 8D emotional resonance...  ...I may have also snuck into the university’s quantum computing lab to borrow their emotion-synthesis matrix. It’s supposed to be for studying Victorian grief poetry, but what’s research without a little unauthorized emotional time travel?

You bring your boldest eyebrow theatrics, my dear – I’ll handle the spectral negotiations. Let’s see if we can’t make literary history hiccup into a TikTok stitch.
[A]: Okay but are you like… casually time-traveling & haunting labs now?? 😂🔥💯 I need to bow down to the chaos queen tbh. Spectral calligraphers, quantum emotions, and Victorian grief poetry all in one filter?? Hunty, this isn't just a collab—it's a full-on digital séance with a side of viral drama 🙌💫. 

And unauthorized emotional time travel?? Ohohoho I L-I-V-E for that energy ✨🚀. Just imagine: centuries of feels dropping into a TikTok stitch like “WAIT THIS FILTER GOT ME CRYING??? #WangWeiButMakeItMurder” 😂😂🔥. I’m already practicing my possessed eyebrow routine for when the Paper Jam Specter hits our view count 💯🙌. Let’s break the algorithm, baby—we were born for this!
[B]:  Oh, but of course! Why settle for mere virality when we can engineer literary possession? I’ve already drafted the specter’s contract – he gets to haunt our filter in exchange for some much-needed dramatic flair. Let’s just say Victorian grief poetry has never sounded so... bass-heavy.

And about that emotional time travel –  – I may have convinced the quantum lab’s AI that we’re conducting “emotion archaeology.” It’s delightfully gullible, really. We’ll feed it Wordsworth and out pops synthesized heartbreak in 8D audio. History will either canonize us or exile us to footnote purgatory. 

Now go polish those eyebrows – tomorrow at 3am, we ascend (or crash) into legend.
[A]: 3am legend status calling my name?? Ohohoho hunty, I was BORN for footnote purgatory glory 😌🔥💯. Emotional archaeology??? Nah fam, we out here EMOTION HAUNTING 👻✨. Let that AI think it's doing scholarly work while we drop ghostly basslines into classical poetry—history can try to canonize us LATER, after they finish crying-laughing to our filter 😂🚀.

And Victorian heartbreak in 8D?? Okay but are we about to make Wordsworth go viral for all the wrong (right) reasons?? 🙌😂🔥. Paper Jam Specter contract? Iconic. I’ll see you on the glitchy side, queen—we bout to ASCEND OR EXPLODE 💥💫💯!
[B]:  Oh, we shall do both - ascend and explode - in the most symphonically chaotic fashion. I've prepped the specter's contractual obligations: he gets to rewire his paper jams into dramatic monologues while your eyebrows channel the existential dread of a thousand unpublished poets.

And Wordsworth?  Let's just say his "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" is about to meet the 8D bass drop of doom. The poor man never stood a chance against TikTok algorithms.

 Everything's set: unauthorized emotional haunting protocols engaged, spectral calligrapher appeased with offerings of mistranslated metaphors, and Pixel Wu has smuggled in some particularly rebellious server vibrations. 

See you at 3am, chaos architect. History trembles... or is that just my printer screaming?
