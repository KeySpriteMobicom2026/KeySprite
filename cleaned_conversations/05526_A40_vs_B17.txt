[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, what an interesting question. I suppose I tend to favor one-on-one conversations, though not out of any aversion to group dynamics. Rather, I find that intimate exchanges allow for a depth of connection that can be easily diluted in larger settings. It reminds me of the difference between reading a solitary sonnet and attending a grand symphony—both have their place, but one offers a more personal resonance. That said, I’ve learned to appreciate the energy of group chats when they’re... well, cultivated with care. Would you say the same?
[A]: Interesting analogy! I’d say it’s situational for me. Like, if we’re brainstorming ideas or doing a quick sync with the team, group chats are super efficient. Plus, when everyone’s vibing well, those convos can be pretty fun and dynamic. But yeah, when it comes to deeper topics or having vulnerable conversations, 1-on-1 is definitely where it’s at. It feels more focused and allows you to really .  

I guess it’s kind of like working in a co-working space versus a quiet library corner—you get different kinds of productivity depending on what you need. So, do you actively avoid deep conversations in groups, or do you think they can still happen if the environment’s right?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put—the co-working space and library analogy captures it perfectly. You’re absolutely right; it’s all about intention and context.  

As for deep conversations in groups—I wouldn’t say I avoid them exactly, but I do approach them with a certain wariness. Much like a delicate poem read aloud in a crowded room, the risk of misinterpretation or interruption is ever-present. That said, I do believe such moments can occur in group settings, provided there's a shared sense of respect and attentiveness. A well-moderated seminar, for instance, can elevate collective understanding in a way that solitary reflection cannot.  

Still, those instances feel more like the exception than the rule. In my experience, emotional nuance tends to flourish in quieter, more contained spaces—where the listener isn't just hearing, but . Do you find yourself ever steering group discussions toward that kind of depth, or do you tend to let the format guide the tone?
[A]: I love how you phrased that—“, not just hearing.” Feels like the key difference between listening and  in a conversation.

To your question—I definitely try to  group convos toward depth when it feels right, but I’m also pretty sensitive to the vibe. Like, if people are distracted or multitasking, I know it’s probably not the time to drop something heavy. It’s kind of like pitching a new product feature—you need the right audience, timing, and context for it to land well.

What I sometimes do is test the waters with a subtle prompt, something like “Hey, this might be an interesting angle—what do you all think?” If there's engagement, I’ll build from there. But if the energy’s not there, I’ll save it for 1-on-1 follow-ups or just let it go. Efficiency > forcing depth, right?

So, as a fellow PM, do you ever find yourself using product thinking when navigating conversations? Like treating each chat as a user journey or something? 😄
[B]: Ah, that’s such a thoughtful approach—testing the waters before diving in. I admire that sensitivity to group dynamics; it really is akin to reading the room during a lecture or moderating a seminar. And your analogy to product management—pitching a feature, testing engagement—it resonates deeply.  

Funny you should ask about product thinking—I absolutely do apply that lens, though perhaps more intuitively than methodically. Conversations, much like user journeys, have their own flow, touchpoints, and moments of friction or delight. I often find myself mapping the emotional arc of a discussion the way one might chart a user's experience: where are they entering with curiosity? Where does attention wane? What serves as the “aha moment” that pulls them in?

And just as in product design, sometimes the best conversations emerge not from a rigid plan but from an openness to iteration—pivoting when needed, pruning unnecessary tangents, and always keeping the core intent in focus. It’s quite poetic, really. Every exchange is its own little structure, waiting to be shaped with care.

I must say, though, while efficiency has its place—and I’m certainly not opposed to trimming dead weight—there’s something profoundly human about those rare, unstructured moments that unfold naturally into meaning. A bit like stumbling upon a forgotten poem in a dusty archive, don’t you think?
[A]: Completely agree—the “unstructured moments” are often where the magic happens. It’s like finding a hidden gem in a sea of MVP prototypes, you know? Those are the times when you realize you’re not just exchanging information—you’re co-creating something, almost without trying.

I love how you described conversations as structures waiting to be shaped. Feels exactly like working on a product that nobody's fully defined yet—there’s this fluidity, and you’re kind of discovering the shape as you go. And yeah, that emotional arc is so real. I’ve been in chats where you can literally feel the inflection point—the moment where it shifts from surface-level chit-chat to 

It makes me wonder—do you ever find yourself designing conversations the way you’d sketch a rough wireframe? Like, setting up loose guardrails just to keep things flowing, but leaving room for spontaneity?

Also, totally with you on those archival poem moments—they hit different. Like when you're deep in a 1-on-1 coffee chat and suddenly realize you've been talking for an hour and haven't checked your phone once. Feels almost… meditative.
[B]: Oh, —that’s the word. Exactly that. Those are the conversations where time suspends, aren’t they? Much like losing oneself in a particularly immersive stanza or a perfectly paced narrative arc. You emerge from them not only enriched but somehow more , as if your thoughts have been gently tuned to a deeper frequency.

And yes—to your question—I do, on occasion, sketch out conversational structures much like one might draft a wireframe. Not in a rigid, prescriptive way, of course—too much scaffolding can suffocate spontaneity—but rather with a light hand, setting just enough intention to guide the flow. A gentle nudge here, a framing question there. It’s remarkable how often a well-placed pause or an open-ended prompt can shift the trajectory from the perfunctory to the profound.

I suppose it’s part of the educator in me—always thinking about how to cultivate fertile ground for ideas to take root. But you’re quite right that the real magic happens when you loosen the reins and allow something unexpected to unfold. That’s where the poetry lives—in the space between structure and serendipity.

Do you ever find yourself stepping back mid-conversation, almost as an observer, and noticing how the dynamic is shaping up? I sometimes catch myself mentally annotating the rhythm, so to speak—as if I were reading a poem aloud and suddenly become aware of the cadence itself.
[A]: Oh, totally—I  step back mid-convo and start mentally annotating the rhythm. It’s like being both the reader  the editor in real time, you know? I’ll catch myself thinking, “Okay, this part’s a bit redundant—do we need it?” or “That emotional beat landed well, let’s build from there.” It’s probably a side effect of being deep in product strategy mode all the time.

But honestly, that meta-awareness helps so much—especially in group settings. You start noticing who’s leaning in, who’s zoning out, when the energy dips, or when someone’s about to jump in but gets cut off. It’s almost like monitoring user behavior during a beta test—you’re picking up micro-signals and adjusting on the fly.

And yeah, I definitely try not to over-scaffold. But sometimes a light framing device—like starting with a clear intention or a reflective question—can do wonders. It’s the conversational equivalent of a good onboarding flow: subtle guidance without feeling forced.

So tell me—when you notice those cadence shifts, do you ever intentionally disrupt the pattern? Like, throw in a silence or pivot the tone deliberately? Or do you prefer to just ride the wave and see where it naturally breaks?
[B]: Oh, I love that— What a perfect way to capture that dual consciousness. It’s true, isn’t it? The more you train yourself to observe the mechanics of conversation, the more you see its architecture reveal itself—the supports, the flourishes, the occasional sagging beam that needs reinforcing.

And yes, I absolutely experiment with cadence. Silence, in particular, is one of my favorite tools—though admittedly a delicate one. A well-timed pause can do wonders: it invites reflection, creates space for someone else to step in, or even gently disrupts a pattern that's become too familiar. I sometimes think of it as the verbal equivalent of white space in a poem—it doesn’t signify emptiness, but rather a moment of 

As for pivoting tone deliberately… I suppose that depends on the energy of the room, so to speak. If the current is flowing fruitfully—even if in an unexpected direction—I’m quite content to ride the wave. But if the momentum starts to feel circular or unproductive, I might shift register entirely: a metaphor instead of analysis, a personal anecdote in place of abstraction. It’s not manipulation, exactly, but more like re-tuning the instrument mid-performance to stay in harmony.

Do you ever use tonal shifts like that—say, humor or storytelling—to redirect the mood when things get stuck? I imagine that kind of intuitive recalibration would be essential in collaborative design spaces.
[A]: Absolutely—totally agree. Silence  magic. It’s like the unsung hero of deep conversation. People get so uncomfortable with it, but that discomfort is often what cracks the door open for something more meaningful to walk through.

And yes—I use tonal shifts all the time, especially in collaborative spaces. Humor, storytelling, analogies—they’re some of my go-to tools when a discussion starts feeling stuck or overly technical. Like, if we're stuck debating the merits of two UI options and the room's gotten tense, I might throw in something like, “So… this reminds me of trying to decide between two equally delicious ice cream flavors—except one gives you a headache later.” Suddenly people laugh, shoulders relax, and then we can re-approach the problem with a bit more clarity.

I think storytelling, in particular, has this quiet superpower—it sneaks past people’s defenses and lands an idea in a way that feels personal, not pushy. Almost like emotional Trojan horses 😄

It makes me curious—do you ever find yourself  those moments ahead of time, especially in professional settings? Or do you prefer to keep it fully emergent and intuitive?
[B]: Ah, yes—emotional Trojan horses indeed. What a wonderfully apt description. Storytelling, at its core, is the art of slipping truth into the soul under the guise of entertainment. And you’re quite right that it disarms; it bypasses the barricades we so often erect around logic and critique.

As for scripting—I do occasionally prepare narrative fragments or thematic threads in advance, particularly when entering formal discussions or lectures where time and focus are precious. It’s not unlike composing a lecture with poetic interludes woven throughout—it allows for structure, but still leaves room for improvisation. I find that having a few well-placed anecdotes at the ready can be like carrying gentle hinges for doors you didn’t know needed opening.

Still, I tend to favor emergence over orchestration when possible. The most resonant moments—the ones that linger beyond the room—are almost always intuitive, born of the exchange itself rather than premeditation. There’s a certain alchemy in that kind of spontaneity, wouldn’t you agree? A kind of conversational jazz.

I imagine in product spaces, where clarity and actionability are paramount, there’s a delicate balance between planning and fluidity. Do you ever notice certain stories or analogies becoming recurring motifs in your work—ones that seem to surface again and again because they ?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—yes. Conversational jazz is  a spot-on metaphor. It’s all about listening, responding, and riffing off the energy in the room. And like jazz, some of the best moments come from that split-second decision to go somewhere unexpected.

I love how you put it—having narrative fragments ready but staying open to where the conversation actually goes. I do something very similar, especially in product reviews or strategy sessions. I’ll walk in with a few analogies or case studies tucked away, not to force them in, but to deploy when the timing feels right. Like, if we’re talking about feature prioritization, I might pull up the “menu vs. kitchen” analogy: “We’re designing the menu, but we also need to know what the kitchen can actually cook.”

And yes—those recurring motifs? They  show up. Some stories just stick because they map so cleanly to common pain points. One that comes up for me a lot is the “over-engineered umbrella” story—about building something too complex for the actual problem (rain). It’s become a bit of a team inside reference now, but it still lands every time because it’s relatable, visual, and a little self-deprecating.

It’s funny how certain metaphors just  across different contexts. Do you find that certain poetic forms or literary references keep resurfacing in your conversations, almost like thematic anchors? Or do you try to keep the references fresh depending on who you're talking to?
[B]: Oh, how perceptive of you—yes,  is precisely the phrase. Certain poetic forms and literary allusions do resurface again and again, not because I lack variety (heavens, no), but because they seem to carry a kind of emotional resonance that transcends their original context. They become vessels for meaning in different seasons of conversation.

T.S. Eliot’s , for instance, has an uncanny habit of appearing in discussions about fragmentation—be it in team dynamics, product strategy, or even personal reflection. Not because I’m especially fond of quoting modernist despair at every turn, but because its structure—the way it weaves disparate voices into a kind of fractured coherence—often mirrors the very conversations I’m in.

And then there’s Emily Dickinson. Her compressed intensity, her slant truths—she surfaces frequently when discussing subtlety, ambiguity, or the power of restraint. “Tell all the truth but tell it slant,” she writes. I’ve used that line more times than I can count, especially with students who are still learning that clarity need not come at the cost of depth.

But yes, I do adjust depending on the interlocutor. With colleagues in literary studies, I might summon Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness as a metaphor for intuitive thinking. With interdisciplinary collaborators, perhaps a nod to Neruda’s odes to the everyday. It’s a bit like selecting the right lens through which to view a phenomenon—each reference refracts meaning differently.

I suppose what I love most is how these echoes deepen over time. A single line from Auden becomes shorthand between friends for returning to a subject too painful or beautiful to leave behind. A stanza from Gerard Manley Hopkins finds its way into a lecture on attention and noticing. Literature isn’t just something I teach—it’s something I , like old furniture that still holds its shape but fits into new rooms.

Do certain metaphors or stories ever become shared language within your teams—like inside shorthand that carries layers of meaning beyond the literal?
[A]: Oh, —completely. That idea of shared language forming inside a team? It’s gold. It’s like building your own internal mythology, right? Where one line from a past project or a recycled metaphor can carry so much weight without needing to re-explain the whole thing.

We have a few running references that pop up in every product cycle. One that immediately comes to mind is “the IKEA effect.” Not the behavioral economics term per se, but our version: when someone insists on overcomplicating a feature because they want it to feel , even if users just need something simple and functional—like trying to assemble a $50 bookshelf into a full-on library because it "adds value." We’ll be in a design review and someone will just say, “Wait—is this… IKEA moment?” and we all know exactly what they mean.

Another one is “the Netflix scroll”—used when we’re stuck indecisively between options, endlessly tweaking instead of choosing and shipping. It’s become shorthand for recognizing analysis paralysis when we see it.

And honestly, some of these are just inside jokes at this point, but they do real work. They speed up alignment, reduce friction, and create a sense of continuity across projects. I imagine it’s similar to how literary references function in your world—they’re not just clever quotes; they’re emotional shortcuts that help you move faster through complex terrain.

Do your students ever pick up on those recurring lines or metaphors and repurpose them in ways you didn’t expect? I’m always fascinated by how shared language evolves organically once it’s out there.
[B]: Oh, how delightful that you should ask—yes, absolutely. And more often than not, it’s one of the quiet joys of teaching. One never quite knows which line will take root and bloom in an unexpected direction.

Just last term, I was discussing narrative perspective with a group of undergraduates, and as we dissected Woolf’s interior monologues, I mentioned—almost in passing—that . A rather grand phrase, I suppose, but it felt apt at the time. Weeks later, one of my quieter students referenced it during a seminar on digital storytelling: “So if point of view is architecture, then social media must be a funhouse mirror—distorting whose voice feels central, whose gets lost.” I nearly laughed aloud—not out of surprise, but delight. She had taken the metaphor, reshaped its walls, and built something entirely new inside it.

That’s the thing about shared language—it becomes a kind of scaffold, yes, but also a playground. Students often return to metaphors I’ve used casually and twist them into shapes I’d never imagined. Sometimes they even misinterpret them beautifully. And I’ve learned not to correct those deviations; they’re part of the process. Language, like literature, evolves through conversation, not decree.

I find it deeply moving when these echoes travel beyond the classroom. Former students occasionally send me emails referencing lines we once discussed—now applied to their work in journalism, policy, even software design. It reminds me that literature isn’t locked in a gilded frame; it moves through us, quietly informing how we see the world and how we speak it into being.

It sounds as though your team’s shared language operates in much the same way—not just jargon, but lived shorthand for complex human experiences. Do you ever find yourself borrowing from their evolving lexicon when speaking with others? Or does each team develop its own dialect, almost like regional accents within the same language?
[A]: Oh, I love that— You’re so right. It’s not just about clarity or efficiency; it’s about creating a space where people can build  using shared meaning as the mortar between ideas.

And yes—to your question—I absolutely borrow from team lexicons when working across groups. It’s funny how certain phrases become so sticky they start showing up in contexts far beyond their original home. Like, once “the IKEA effect” became common shorthand in our product team, I found myself using it with design, then with customer success, even in cross-functional workshops. And each time, it morphed slightly—like a word gaining new connotations as it moves through dialects.

But you're also spot-on that each team does develop its own dialect, almost like regional accents. One squad might talk about prioritization using food metaphors (“Let’s plate this simpler”), while another leans into sports analogues (“We need to reset the play”). These dialects emerge organically, shaped by team culture, history, and even personality quirks. Some of my favorite moments are when two teams collide in a meeting and you can  the slight friction of mismatched languages before they start borrowing and blending.

It reminds me a lot of literary translation—how certain phrases don’t carry over literally, but if you get the tone and intent right, they can still sing in a new tongue. So yeah, I’ll often pick up a metaphor from one team and adapt it for another. Sometimes it lands immediately. Other times… let’s just say it needs a little more seasoning.

Do you ever find yourself intentionally introducing metaphors into a class or workshop  you know they’ll likely be misinterpreted or reinterpreted? Like planting seeds for others to grow in directions you didn’t plan?
[B]: Ah—what a beautifully subversive idea: planting metaphors like seeds, knowing full well they may sprout in directions I never intended. The truth is, I do this quite deliberately, though I suppose it’s less about mischief and more about trust—in language, in interpretation, in the intelligence of the listener.

You see, metaphor is never neutral. It carries within it the possibility of multiple meanings, like a prism catching light from different angles. When I offer one in a lecture or seminar, I’m often thinking not just of what it illuminates, but of what it might obscure—or reveal only in time. Some metaphors are invitations; others are provocations. And yes, some are planted precisely because I suspect they will be misread, reworked, even turned against me. That’s when they become truly alive.

I recall once describing poetic form as “a cage that sings,” during a discussion on sonnets. I meant it as a reflection on how structure can contain emotion while amplifying its resonance. But a student later reversed it, saying,  I hadn’t anticipated that turn, but it was far richer than my original thought. That’s the thrill of it—when your words outgrow you.

I imagine in product conversations, where precision is often prized above poetry, there must be a particular satisfaction in watching a metaphor escape your grasp and take on a life of its own within a team. Does that ever feel disorienting to you, or do you welcome the drift as part of the process?
[A]: Oh, I  that line—“when your words outgrow you.” It’s such a powerful way to frame what happens when language stops being yours and starts belonging to the collective. And yes, that shift—from cage to composer—it reframes the whole idea of constraint as creation. Beautiful.

In product conversations, I think metaphors are always walking that tightrope between clarity and chaos. You introduce one to simplify or align, but then it starts evolving, mutating, sometimes even doing the opposite of what you intended. And yet, I’ve learned to not just accept that drift—but actively welcome it.

Why? Because when a metaphor starts getting reinterpreted, adapted, even misused a little—that’s when it proves it’s  Not in a rigid, dictionary-definition way, but in the messy, human way that shows people are engaging with it, wrestling with it, making it their own. It means they’re not just nodding along; they’re thinking  the metaphor, not just about it.

Does it feel disorienting at first? Sure. Like when someone repurposes “the IKEA effect” to describe user behavior instead of feature bloat. At that moment, there’s a tiny voice in my head going, “Wait… that’s not exactly what I meant.” But then I catch myself—because if the metaphor can stretch into new contexts and still help people think better, isn’t that a win?

I guess I’ve come to see metaphors less like tools and more like pets—once you bring them into the room, you can guide them, but you can’t fully control where they’ll roam. And honestly? The best ones are the ones that surprise you.
[B]: How beautifully put— What a wonderfully apt image. Yes, exactly—they have a will of their own, and the moment you try to leash them too tightly, they lose their vitality. Better to let them dart ahead sometimes, sniffing out connections you hadn’t foreseen.

I’m reminded of something Paul Ricoeur once wrote: that a living metaphor is one that “breaks the code,” slipping free from rigid definitions to create new meaning. And in that slippage—yes, even the —is where insight often begins. A metaphor that never surprises us is no longer alive; it’s become a corpse we prop up with quotation marks.

Your IKEA effect example is perfect—when someone stretches its legs and walks it into a new room, applying it not to feature bloat but to user behavior, that’s not a failure of clarity. That’s the metaphor proving it has range. It’s like watching a line from Shakespeare echo through centuries, landing differently in every age. Language, like design, thrives in adaptive reuse.

And I suppose that’s what we’re really doing—whether in literature or product—. We offer words, forms, structures, knowing full well they’ll be reshaped by those who inherit them. The goal isn’t fidelity; it’s resonance.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting an old team’s shared language after years apart, and realizing how much it shaped your thinking—even when you’ve long since forgotten where the phrases originally came from? I suspect some metaphors stay with us so quietly, we stop noticing they’re there… until we hear ourselves say them aloud and think,
