[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, meal prep—what an interesting concept. I must admit, my approach to it is rather...unstructured. You see, I tend to oscillate between moments of noble intention and the comforting chaos of improvisation. There was a time when I tried to plan my week's meals every Sunday evening—it brought a sense of order, almost like organizing a bibliography. But inevitably, I'd find myself veering off course, seduced by the whim of a freshly picked heirloom tomato at the market or the sudden craving for something utterly unplanned, like a bowl of miso soup on a rainy afternoon.

In truth, I suppose I'm more of a  than a disciplined preparer. Still, I admire the discipline behind meal prep—it’s akin to outlining a novel before writing it. Do you follow a structured routine, or are you also prone to culinary detours?
[A]: 说起备餐，倒让我想起古人“食不厌精，脍不厌细”的讲究来。我虽不至于如此讲究，却也常在案头翻书时，随手记下些应季的食材与菜式，权当是给生活添些章法。譬如秋深时节，见窗外黄叶纷飞，便想煮一锅银杏老鸭汤，既合时令，又得几分诗意。

不过说来惭愧，我终究是个随性之人。计划赶不上变化，有时兴致来了，提笔写一首小诗，便忘了厨房里炖着什么；或是友人忽至，只得临时改换菜单，另备茶点。倒也不觉可惜，反倒觉得这烟火气中多了些人情味。

倒是你，言语间竟将备餐比作小说提纲，实在妙极。看来你是位有心之人。不知你平日可也有这般“即兴发挥”的时刻？
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully poetic way to approach cooking—treating it almost like a literary practice, responsive to mood and season. I find that deeply admirable. You're right, of course, about the charm of those unplanned moments; they remind me of the  in Sterne’s —meandering, perhaps inefficient, but full of life and character.

As for my own improvisations, yes—though perhaps less poetically than your silver-leafed ginkgo and duck broth—I do have my share of culinary detours. Last week, for instance, I had every intention of roasting squash with sage, only to be seduced by an unexpected bunch of fresh watercress at the market. The result? A rather impromptu soup, thickened with coconut milk and laced with lime—one might call it a quiet rebellion against structure.

And yet, I envy that ease with which you blend spontaneity and reflection. It's much like reading—sometimes one follows the index, other times one simply lets the pages fall open where they may. Do you find your students ever adopt this kind of seasonal rhythm in their studies? Or is that a fantasy too delicate for modern academic life?
[A]: 你将那些即兴的烹饪时刻比作《项狄传》中的离题漫游，实在贴切。人生何尝不是如此？章法固然重要，但若无些许旁逸斜出的情趣，未免失之刻板。那锅你临场改作的椰奶水芹汤，倒像是即兴写就的一首小令，虽不循格律，却自有其风韵。

至于学生——说起这个，我倒是常有感慨。如今的年轻人课业繁重，信息纷杂，能静下心来体会“春诵夏弦，秋读冬学”的节奏，确实不易。不过，也并非全然没有希望。偶有三五学子，在课后寻来，问些看似“无用”的问题，比如“陶渊明种豆南山，是不是也在寻找一种生活的节奏？”这样的时刻，便让我觉得，那份与自然、与心灵对话的读书传统，仍在悄悄延续。

说到底，无论是治学还是烹饪，都需一点规矩，也留一些余地，好让灵感偶尔脱缰，走一遭自己的路。你意下如何？
[B]: Quite so—, as Sterne so delightfully reminds us. And perhaps the same might be said of life: that the so-called deviations are not distractions at all, but rather the very essence of meaning-making. Your students’ quiet curiosity—that longing to find rhythm in a world of noise—is deeply moving. I’m reminded of Hölderlin’s line, —where danger grows, so too does salvation. Even in the frenzy of modern academia, there remains a quiet undercurrent of reflection, like a hidden brook beneath autumn leaves.

As for your point about structure and spontaneity—I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I often think of cooking and teaching as parallel acts of care. One prepares a lesson plan much as one lays out ingredients: with intention, yes, but also with the quiet understanding that both pedagogy and cuisine demand flexibility, even vulnerability. A dish, like a lecture, can burn if one clings too rigidly to the recipe.

And speaking of which—might I ask if you ever prepare meals while reading poetry? I’ve tried it, though not always successfully. There’s something about Bashō’s  that seems to pair well with simmering broth… or perhaps that’s merely my imagination indulging itself.
[A]: 你引斯特恩之言，又及荷尔德林的诗句，真是令我心有所感。所谓“危险之处亦生长着拯救”，在今日讲堂之上，或即体现为那一两双仍愿追问陶渊明为何种豆的眼睛。他们尚能在字句之间寻找节律，于纷繁世象中求一念安顿，确如你说，是藏于落叶下的清泉。

至于烹饪与教学——你将二者皆视为“关怀之举”，实在精辟。我也常有此感：备课如配菜，需先理其性，再调其味；而临场应对，则如火候变化，稍有不慎，便失温凉。若一味拘泥计划，不察听讲者神色之流转，就如同炖汤时不揭盖尝味，终究失之呆板。

说来有趣，你问起我是否边读诗边做饭，这正是我常做之事。书房与厨房本就不该隔得太远。有时午后无事，便在灶前翻读《东坡题跋》，看他谈吃谈酒，妙语如珠，不觉锅中香气已浓。前日煮茶干时，正吟至王维“行到水穷处”，忽觉炉火微熄，遂添柴续炊，竟似与古人同行一段幽径。这般光景，倒不知是我在读诗，还是诗在料理我了。

你既提松尾芭蕉的俳句与汤羹同烹，想必也是个懂味之人。可否道来一二，你曾在哪位诗人笔下，觅得哪一道菜肴的灵感？
[B]: Ah, what a delightful image—that of simmering beans beside the , as if the verses themselves were steeping into the broth. I can quite imagine you at that stove, parchment in one hand, ladle in the other, walking that same quiet path where poetry and nourishment converge.

As for your question—yes, I have often found myself inspired by poets across languages and centuries, though rarely with such elegance as you describe. There was an evening not long ago when I read Rilke’s —you know the opening lines:

> "Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr groß.  
Leg deinen Schatten auf die Sonnenuhren..."

And somehow, that melancholy sense of summer waning, of time folding inward, moved me to prepare something both grounding and gently sweet—a roasted beet and pomegranate salad, dressed simply with aged balsamic and thyme. It wasn’t so much that the poem prescribed the dish, but rather that it set a mood, a season of the soul, if you will.

Another time, while re-reading Eliot’s , I found myself drawn to his meditations on stillness and motion. The next morning, I made a kind of spiced porridge—oats, cardamom, orange zest, a whisper of clove—something warm and slow and contemplative. Perhaps indulgently so.

But now I wonder—are there particular dishes that, for you, evoke a specific literary memory? Something passed down not through cookbooks, but through verse or prose?
[A]: 你这番话，真如秋日午后的一盏清茶，令人神远。里尔克的《秋日》与烤甜菜沙拉相映成趣，艾略特的沉思与肉桂燕麦同温共热——看来你不仅是位烹饪者，更是一位以味入诗、以食寄情的行者。

若论菜肴与文学的记忆，倒让我想起一道家传的“东坡豆腐”。祖母生前最爱念起苏轼那句“日啖荔枝三百颗”，笑说他虽豪迈，到底还是个贪嘴的诗人。她做的豆腐不求形似红烧肉，却讲究火候流转间入味三分，正如读书需细嚼慢咽，方得其妙。那道豆腐我至今仍会偶尔做来，一边翻读《苏东坡集》，一边仿佛听见她在厨房轻声笑道：“慢火煨着呢，别急。”

又有一回，读到李清照“雪里已知春信至，寒梅点缀琼枝腻”，心下忽动，便动手做了道梅花粥。取白米熬煮至稠，撒几瓣干白梅，添一缕桂花香，置于窗边，看雪落梅枝，竟觉字句与滋味俱在舌尖流转，一时不知身在词中，还是梦里。

要说这些菜是否见于哪本菜谱，我倒不敢说。它们更像是从文字里长出的味道，一代代人口传心授，未曾写进书里，却深藏记忆之中。你既有如此多诗意化作滋味，可曾想过将它们整理成一本小册子，题作《炉边诗食录》一类？
[B]: What a tender and evocative memory—your grandmother’s , slow-cooked not just in flavor but in meaning, simmering across generations. It strikes me that food, like poetry, becomes a vessel for the voices we wish never to lose. And your —oh, what a delicate alchemy of sight, scent, and syllable. One might say you don’t simply cook with ingredients, but with echoes.

I confess, the idea of a little volume—, perhaps—has crossed my mind more than once. But I hesitate, not out of doubt in the concept, but rather from a certain reverence for the formless way these inspirations arise. They are, after all, fleeting as the turning of seasons or the fading scent of citrus zest on one’s fingers.

Still, your words stir something. Perhaps it needn't be a formal cookbook at all—no measurements, no rigid instructions. Just a collection of moments, each dish paired with a line of verse, a mood, a memory. A kind of , if you will.

And now I must ask—if you were to write such a book, how would you structure it? By season? By poet? Or by some more elusive logic, like the cadence of rainfall or the scent of ink on an old page?
[A]: 你所说的“诗食随笔”——《炉边诗食录》，实在令人心动。它不需拘于格式，也无需讲究章法，倒像是在纸上随意点染，一笔一画皆由心生。若是我来写这样一本书，或许真会依循你说的“季节流转”或“雨声风韵”这般无形的节奏。

比如开篇从立春始，取一碗清粥小菜，配陆游那句“春风春雨春天气”，再引出一碟新腌的青梅；待到夏日炎炎，则是一盅荷叶清蒸鱼，佐以白居易“力尽不知热，但惜夏日长”的辛劳与清凉。秋深时，可设一道桂花栗子羹，应和杜牧“银烛秋光冷画屏”；冬至夜，则是煨了一夜的老鸭汤，配上王维的“隔牖风惊竹，开门雪满山”。

当然，也可依诗人而分章节。李白一卷，多些豪迈酒肴，如炙鹅肝、椒盐虾，佐以诗句：“会须一饮三百杯。”苏轼一册，自然少不了东坡肉与豆腐羹；李清照则宜配以清淡小食，如藕粉梅花冻、茉莉香茶糕。如此编排，不只是讲吃，更是在味中读人，在诗里品食。

不过，我倒也愿留一章给那些无名时刻——譬如某日午后，忽见窗前落叶，便随手煮了一碗南瓜浓汤，配一片抹了蜂蜜的吐司，那时耳边正回响着陶渊明的“采菊东篱下”。这类段落，不必标时节，也不列作者，只记那一刻的心境与滋味。

你意下如何？若你动笔，我想这本书定然不是 cookbook，而是一部“心录”——用味觉织就的诗史，用舌尖吟诵的文章。
[B]: Ah, what a profoundly evocative structure—this weaving of time, taste, and text into something at once personal and universal. You’ve described not merely a book, but an  given form. To follow the seasons is to align oneself with the rhythm of the earth; to organize by poet is to dine with ghosts; and to preserve those nameless afternoons—that is perhaps the most intimate act of all. One could almost say it’s a kind of literary gastrography, if such a word may be allowed.

I find myself particularly drawn to your idea of that unmarked chapter—the one devoted not to occasion or author, but simply to mood. It reminds me of the Japanese concept of , that profound and elusive sense of mystery in the air—something felt, not explained. A bowl of pumpkin soup stirred by the whisper of autumn wind through maple trees… yes, that deserves its own quiet space in such a volume.

If I were to contribute, I might offer a vignette titled : a plate of roasted figs with goat cheese and thyme, drizzled lightly with honey, served alongside a passage from . Not because the dish illustrates the poem, but because both arise from the same fleeting sense of presence—of standing on the threshold between what is and what was.

As for the title—perhaps something even less fixed than . Something like  or . Or perhaps best of all, simply: .

What do you think? Would such a title hold the spirit of what we’re imagining?
[A]: 《席间众声》——此名一出，便觉满室生香，似有千百诗句在杯盘之间低语。它不拘形迹，却自有风骨；既如你所说，是“临界时刻”的低吟浅唱，又似我所感，是炉火边的絮语呢喃。若以此为题，真可谓以舌尖为纸，以滋味为墨，录下那些未曾写入诗行的余韵。

你说想添一则“九月末读里尔克”的小品，配以无花果与山羊奶酪，再佐以《杜伊诺哀歌》中的一段。这安排极妙，非但不是图解诗文，反倒是将诗之魂藏于果香之中，令人咀嚼之余，忽有所悟。如此笔法，恰似古人评点时随手批注，字不在多，而意趣盎然。

我若续写，或可添一节名为 ：深冬夜寒，灯下重读《饮酒二十首》，忽觉心绪澄明，遂起炊煮白米粥一碗，不加他物，只取其清。此时食之，竟胜珍馐。这般光景，何尝不是一种“味外之味”？

我想，这部书最动人之处，正是你我皆未设界限。它不求系统完备，反倒因散落而成珠玉；不讲技艺高低，却凭心意相通。它是一部“有温度的笔记”，而非冷冰冰的典籍。

故我以为，《A Table of Voices》之名，不但合宜，且足以引人驻足、凝神、回味——正如一顿慢火细炖的饭食，也如一句久别重逢的诗。
[B]: 

You’ve captured its spirit so perfectly—the idea that this is not a manual, but a murmuring anthology of moments, a collection of echoes shared across time and tongue. And your —ah, there’s a kind of sacred simplicity in that. It calls to mind the Zen saying:  Only now, perhaps, one might add: 

If I may borrow your form for a moment—I too might write a vignette titled , wherein I prepare a simple omelette with chives and butter, golden and trembling on the edge of the pan, served with a slice of rye bread and a glass of cold milk. Nothing extravagant—yet eaten in the hush of late afternoon, just as the light softens and Hölderlin’s line lingers:

> 

Human unity, like the gods—yes, even in something as modest as a midday meal shared in silence or spoken over pages turned.

I do hope, my dear, that you’ll someday bring your own entries to paper. I’d gladly sit at your table—real or imagined—and lift a spoon, or a verse, in quiet celebration.
[A]: 若真有那么一册《席间众声》，我想，它必是一本不设封面的书——页纸散放案头，任人翻阅，时而添几行新墨，时而删几句旧语，如同四季更替，无人可拘。

你那则“五月底读荷尔德林，煎一枚颤动的葱花蛋饼”，读来令人眼眶微热。如此朴素的一餐，竟因一句诗而生出神性：“Menschlich einig / Wie die Götter…” 人与神相近，非在庙堂之上，而在锅边一缕香起之时。你说得对，这不仅是饮食，更是一种静默的共在——人、诗、食，同坐一席，彼此照见。

若我续写一章，或可题作 。那日檐下雨细，炉上水沸，随手取出半卷残书，翻至“此情可待成追忆”，忽觉旧梦如烟，遂以苦茶一杯自遣。茶味清苦，却回甘良久，正如旧诗，虽不解其意，却总能在某一刻，触心而不言。

或许这部书最该保留的，便是这份未完的节奏——不必写毕，亦无需出版，只在某个想煮点什么、念点什么的时刻，轻轻翻开一页，便觉人间尚有余温。

愿他日你我皆能以食记诗，以味传情，在烟火之间，留一席无声的对话，长存纸上。
[B]: Ah, a book without a cover—what a beautiful metaphor. It suggests something ever-growing, never fully settled, like conversation itself. Pages drifting like petals on a pond, some ink still damp, others curling at the edges with age. Yes, that is precisely the spirit.

Your —oh, how exquisitely you evoke that particular ache of memory, the kind that lingers not as sorrow, but as a soft bruise touched gently by time. The bitterness of the tea, the quiet rain beyond the eaves, the half-remembered lines that rise unbidden—these are the moments where life becomes literature, and vice versa.

I imagine that in such a book, no entry would be too small to merit inclusion. A single sip of broth, a fleeting line overheard in a dream, the way steam rises from a teacup like breath on glass. It would be an offering, not a declaration—a whisper rather than a lecture.

And I do hope, my dear friend, that you will one day begin that collection. Even if only for yourself. For in those quiet pages, you would not merely record meals or poems—you would preserve the texture of thought, the flavor of feeling, the warmth of being alive.

And should you ever invite me to sit beside you at that imagined table, I shall bring a bowl of warm barley porridge, a sprig of thyme, and a copy of Cavafy’s , for reasons even I may not yet fully understand.

Until then, let us continue this feast—in word, in taste, and in quiet companionship.
[A]: 若真要动笔，我想，这本书定然不能在喧闹中写就，须得择一静室，窗外有竹影摇曳，案头一盏旧灯，炉边一壶常温的茶。我或许会在某个晨起煮粥的时刻写下几句苏轼，因那米香中竟有一缕“回首向来萧瑟处”的余韵；或是在梅雨时节晒书时泡一杯莲心茶，翻到《夜雨寄北》那句“何当共剪西窗烛”，忽觉舌尖微苦，心事如潮。

你说它不必完整，我亦以为，正因其散落，才更近真实。人生本无全篇，不过片段连缀而成——一勺清汤、半句残诗、一声轻叹、一抹炉烟。若能将这些微不足道的瞬间一一记下，便是一本最私密也最普世的书。

你若他日携大麦粥与卡瓦菲斯而来，我必备好一碟青梅与《夜泊牛渚》待你。那时不谈学问，也不论章法，只围炉细语，任诗意随汤匙起落，让滋味伴词句流转。

愿这席未竟之书，成为我们不言而别却始终未散的对话。
[B]: Ah, what a tranquil scene you paint—a study steeped in stillness, where even the steam from a bowl of congee might carry the scent of longing and verse. Yes, it must be written only in such quiet hours, when the world has not yet pressed its demands upon the soul.

I find myself thinking of Sei Shōnagon’s , that lovely mosaic of impressions—fleeting, personal, yet somehow eternal. Not unlike what we imagine yours might become. Not a book of grand statements, but of delicate annotations to life itself.

And I shall look forward to that day—when your pages are gathered like fallen leaves, and my barley porridge steams gently beside your pickled plums. We shall read not for meaning, but for companionship; not for answers, but for the quiet joy of asking together.

Yes, let this imagined volume remain unbound, untitled, perhaps even unwritten—until such time as the moment calls for a line, a taste, or a sigh. For now, let it simply be this: our lingering conversation, seasoned with thought, stirred by memory, and savored slowly, like the best of meals.

Until then, I shall keep my thyme close, my Cavafy dog-eared, and my teapot warm—for when you call, I shall be ready.
[A]: 若说《枕草子》是清少纳言写给时光的情书，那么这本未名之书，或许便是我们写给生活的一封长信——不为传世，只为记下那些曾令我们心之一动的片刻。一片落叶可作一页，一盏茶凉亦成一章。

你说得对，它不必急于成书，甚至不必真正“完成”。有时，真正的滋味恰恰在那未写完的一行、未盛满的一碗、未道尽的一句话里。就像此刻，窗外或许正飘着细雨，炉上的汤尚在微沸，而我们仍愿多说几句，不是为了说服谁，而是因为言语之间，有一种温柔的陪伴正在悄然生成。

待你携卡瓦菲斯与大麦粥而来时，我必已洗净青梅，将《夜泊牛渚》翻至那句：

> “寒磬也深宵，空心中起哀。”

但那一夜，我们或不再读诗，只静静听柴火轻响，任热气氤氲上眼睫，模糊了文字，也温润了人间。

等你。
[B]: Your words settle like the last note of a melody played softly on a twilight veranda—lingering, resonant, tender.

Yes, . A long, meandering letter written in the margins of ordinary days, sealed not with wax but with the quiet understanding that some companionships are kept alive by shared silences as much as by spoken lines.

I think of Bashō again, walking the old road to Ishiyama Temple, where he writes not of grand revelations, but of a single lantern’s glow flickering on the river’s surface—enough to guide a step, enough to see what matters. Our imagined volume, if it ever takes shape, should hold no more and no less than that: the small, steady light of noticing.

And so I shall come, one day, with Cavafy’s verses tucked beside my barley porridge, and I shall find you there—where the fire whispers low, the teapot steams gently, and the page is left open, waiting.

Until then, and beyond—  
I remain,  
listening.
