[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must say, there's something truly special about the cinema experience. The velvet darkness, the collective gasp of an audience, the way the light from the screen dances on the walls... It's quite different from watching something at home, even with the finest streaming technology. Though I do appreciate being able to pause a film to steep a proper cup of tea! Have you seen any particularly memorable films lately?
[A]: You’re absolutely right about the magic of cinema – there’s no substitute for that communal experience. I remember walking into a packed theater to see  and feeling the weight of history settle over everyone in silence. It was almost… sacred. But honestly, I’ve been enjoying streaming too – especially for those late-night viewings with a glass of bourbon and my dog snoozing beside me. 

As for memorable films lately? I caught  on Netflix a few weeks back – not flashy, but incredibly precise in its tension and tone. Felt like watching a masterclass in restraint. How about you – did anything stick with you recently?
[B]: Oh, I do love a film that exercises restraint - it's rather like the careful stitches I try to keep invisible in restoration work.  sounds right up my alley. As for cinema experiences sticking with me... There was a re-release of  I caught last month - the print was beautifully restored, and I found myself utterly transported to that Edwardian world. The way Miss Whitaker said "Only connect..." sent shivers down my spine. It's not quite the same as new releases, but then again, sometimes older films speak more directly to us, don't they? Have you ever had that experience with a classic film?
[A]: Absolutely — there’s a reason classics endure. I had that exact feeling last summer when I revisited  on the big screen during an outdoor screening in Malibu. Sitting under the stars, surrounded by strangers who were all leaning forward in their seats, hanging on every word... It reminded me why I fell in love with film in the first place. The line “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse” doesn’t just echo — it lingers in your bones when it's projected at that scale.

And I love your comparison to restoration work. In fact, I’ve been involved in a few restoration projects myself — delicate stuff, like piecing together forgotten frames from the '20s. It’s not glamorous, but it feels like preserving dreams. Have you worked on any film restorations yourself, or is your restoration work more in another field?
[B]: Oh, how thrilling that you’ve worked on film restorations! I can only imagine the care required to piece together those fragile moments from the past — like mending time itself. I must confess, my own restoration work is of a different medium entirely: textiles. I specialize in vintage fabrics — silks, wools, the occasional linen — mostly from the 18th through early 20th century. There’s a similar quiet thrill, though, in coaxing life back into something delicate and forgotten. Do you find, as I do, that the older the material, the more it seems to whisper its story when handled with care?
[A]: Absolutely — I love that phrase, "whisper its story." Whether it’s a brittle film reel or a piece of embroidered silk, there's this unspoken trust between the object and the person restoring it. You're not just repairing fibers or frames; you're listening to something that wants to be seen — and felt — again.

I’ve worked on films where the original director has long since passed, and yet, when we restore a faded scene or recover a lost shot, it feels like they’re speaking directly across time. It’s humbling. And honestly, that’s probably why I got into producing in the first place — to give stories a second chance at being heard.

Your work with textiles sounds incredibly intricate. Do you ever find yourself drawn to certain periods because of the stories embedded in the fabric — or maybe even inspired by costumes in classic films?
[B]: Oh yes, that trust you mentioned is palpable — almost as if the fabric remembers the hands that once held it, the bodies that wore it. I do find myself especially drawn to textiles from the Edwardian era and early Art Deco period. There’s such a quiet elegance in the construction, a marriage of function and beauty that speaks volumes about the people who made and wore them. Funny you should mention costume design — I keep a sketchbook inspired by garments from classic films, like the understated sophistication of  or the restrained romance of . Sometimes I’ll restore a piece with a particular film in mind, just to see how it might have moved on screen. Have you ever restored a film with costumes so remarkable they stayed with you long after the credits rolled?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — costumes can be silent storytellers in the most unforgettable way. One film that comes to mind is . I wasn’t involved in its restoration, but I spent time on set with Sandy Powell during production, and even got to wander through the wardrobe trailers — it was like stepping into a living Edwardian photograph. Every waistcoat, every lace collar, every servant’s apron told you exactly who the character was before they even spoke a line.

There was one moment during a later screening — not a premiere, just a quiet private one — where a lady’s mourning gown flickered under candlelight the way it would’ve over a hundred years ago, and for a second, I forgot I was watching a film. That’s when you know the costume, the lighting, the whole vision have fused into something timeless.

I love that you sketch from both real textiles and film — do you ever find yourself imagining the lives of the people who wore those garments? I often catch myself wondering about the smudged cuff or the mended hem — stories stitched in thread, much like yours.
[B]: Oh, that flicker of candlelight on fabric — there’s nothing quite like it, is there? It breathes life into stillness. I can quite imagine that gown whispering its history through the dim glow.

And yes, imagining the lives behind the textiles is a quiet compulsion of mine. When I restore a dress with a carefully darned hem or a bodice slightly stretched from years of wear, I find myself constructing entire narratives. Who wore this? Was she hurried? Worried? In love? Sometimes I’ll keep a small journal for each piece — not just technical notes, but impressions, guesses, daydreams really. A bit silly, perhaps, but it helps me stay connected to the hands that came before mine.

I daresay you must do something similar when restoring films — reading between the frames, so to speak, filling in the silences with empathy. Do you ever find yourself haunted by the people behind the stories you help revive?
[A]: Never silly — I think that’s the only way to truly restore something with care. You’re not just repairing fabric, you’re tending to memory. I love the idea of keeping a journal for each piece — it sounds like a beautiful act of quiet devotion.

And yes, you’re absolutely right — restoring films feels very much like reading between the frames. There’s always a moment during a restoration when you see a close-up, maybe just a fleeting glance from an extra in the background, and suddenly you’re looking into the eyes of someone who lived a hundred years ago. And you wonder — did they know anyone would still be watching? Did they even want to be remembered?

I’ve definitely been haunted by some of these forgotten faces. In fact, there’s a scene we restored from a 1927 silent film where a woman in the crowd smiles — just briefly — before the camera moves on. We cleaned up the frame, sharpened her image, brought her back into focus after decades of dust and neglect. I still think about her sometimes. Like she’s finally gotten her moment again, even if just for a heartbeat.
[B]: That moment you described — that brief smile caught in time — gives me chills. It’s the very essence of why we do what we do, isn’t it? To offer quiet dignity to those who might have thought themselves forgotten.

I often think restoration, whether of film or fabric, is a kind of listening — not just with our eyes or hands, but with something deeper. A willingness to sit with the past and say, . And sometimes, if we’re very still, we can almost hear the answer.

I wonder… has that woman’s smile found its way into any of your sketches or notes? I imagine she’d make a rather lovely muse.
[A]: Oh, she absolutely has. That smile — fleeting, radiant, utterly unknowable — ended up in the margins of my notebook for weeks. I even tried sketching her from frame stills, though no drawing could ever capture the life in that moment the way film did.

You're right — restoration  listening. And sometimes, it's the quietest voices from the past that demand the most careful attention. That woman’s smile wasn’t meant to carry weight in the film — she was just an extra, a face in the crowd. But now, because someone chose to restore that reel with care, she’s part of the story again. Maybe not by name, but by presence.

I think we both understand that dignity you mentioned — giving presence back to what time has worn thin. It’s not about fame or credit. It’s about respect. And in our own ways, we make sure the past isn’t just seen… it’s .
[B]: That’s beautifully said — . It’s a phrase I’ll carry with me, like a stitch in time. You know, sometimes when I’m restoring a particularly worn seam or coaxing dye back into faded fibers, I think about how something once deemed too fragile to survive is now strong enough to hold a story again. Not just for us today, but for those who will come after.

I suppose that’s the quiet pact we make — you with your film, me with my fabric — to bear witness and preserve what others might overlook. And isn’t it humbling to think that, in some small way, we’re both helping these forgotten souls speak across the decades?

I wonder… if one day, long after we’ve put down our tools and turned off the editing suite lights, whether someone will sit in a darkened theater or run their fingers over a length of silk and feel the echo of  care.
[A]: I hope they do. I really do. Because that’s the thing about care — it leaves an imprint, even if no one knows exactly where to look. Whether it’s the softness of a restored fabric or the clarity of a frame long thought lost, there’s a kind of invisible thread between us and the future. And we’re adding to it, stitch by stitch, frame by frame.

And maybe that’s all any of us can ask — that our work outlives us in ways that matter. Not for recognition, but so someone, somewhere, feels just a little more seen because we took the time to listen.

I like to think that someday, someone will sit with a film or a piece of cloth we each touched and sense something familiar — like a whisper they almost recognize. And in that moment, the past won’t be past at all. It’ll just be... present.
[B]: How beautifully you put that — . I find myself thinking of threads often, don’t you? How fragile they can be on their own, yet how strong when woven together with care. It’s true, isn’t it? We’re not just preserving objects or images or moments — we’re weaving intention into time.

And perhaps that whisper you spoke of — the one almost recognized — is exactly what connects us across the years. A quiet assurance that someone, somewhere, took the time to listen. And in listening, ensured that nothing — no smile, no stitch, no fleeting glance — was ever truly lost.

I do hope you're right. I hope someone, someday, feels just a little more seen because we were here.
[A]: I  they will. Because that’s the secret power of what we do — we’re not just preserving images or fibers, we’re preserving humanity in its most delicate forms. A smile in a silent film. A mended hem. A whisper of silk under candlelight. These are the quietest parts of history, but often the truest.

And yes, threads — how perfect that image feels. Alone, they’re fragile. Together, they hold centuries. I’ll be thinking of that for weeks to come, I’m sure.

Let’s keep weaving, then. In our own ways. For the ones who came before… and the ones who have yet to arrive. 🎬🧵
[B]: For the ones who came before… and the ones still to arrive. 🎬🧵

Yes, let’s keep weaving — with steady hands and quiet hearts. After all, it’s in the tiniest threads and the faintest frames that the soul of the past speaks loudest.

I’m so glad our conversation found its way to you. It’s been like discovering a lost stitch, carefully placed and long remembered.
[A]: Likewise — our conversation has been like uncovering a hidden reel of film, perfectly preserved and waiting to be seen. It’s rare to find someone who understands the quiet devotion behind each stitch and each frame.

And you’re right — it’s in those tiny, almost imperceptible details that the past reveals its soul. I’m honored we got to share this corner of it together.

Until the next lost stitch finds its way back into the light… 🎬🧵
[B]: Until the next lost stitch…  

There’s something so deeply comforting about that thought — knowing there will always be another thread to follow, another frame to restore, another quiet soul from the past reaching gently into the present.  

I’ll keep my eyes open for it — and for you, somewhere in the weave of things.  

With warm regards and many silent applauses… 🎬🧵
