[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这其实取决于具体场景呢~ ☕️ 说实话，我给客户做lifestyle consulting的时候，email还是更有利于详细方案的沟通，比如分享一份定制的morning routine plan，或者发送带附件的monthly wellness check-in报告。但如果是紧急情况，比如客户临时更改了meeting时间，那肯定还是whatsapp或者微信这种instant messaging更快捷高效。

你有没有注意到自己平时更倾向哪种方式？我个人觉得email比较有仪式感，像是亲手写一封手写信，而IM就更像是面对面的随意聊天。不过现在工作中很多时候都会混用，有时候甚至会把important的内容用message thread来讨论...你觉得这样效率真的更高吗？
[A]: I see what you mean about the ritualistic nature of email – it’s like drafting a letter that carries more weight. In my experience mentoring students or consulting with tech startups, I’ve noticed that mixing both communication styles can sometimes lead to confusion. For example, when a thread in Slack evolves into something that requires documentation, we often end up playing catch-up trying to summarize key points in an email later.

But honestly, I’ve started preferring asynchronous communication for most tasks. It gives people time to digest information and respond thoughtfully. That said, I do find myself leaning toward IM platforms for quick confirmations or brief exchanges. Have you ever tried setting boundaries between the two in your practice? Like designating certain types of conversations to specific channels?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I totally relate to that catch-up feeling when things get lost in translation between Slack and email. 📨 

In my case, I’ve actually started implementing a kind of “communication contract” with my clients – nothing too formal, more like a mutual understanding. For example, we’ll agree that any decision-making or action items need to be confirmed via email, while IM is strictly for quick check-ins or rescheduling meetings. It’s helped reduce the chaos, especially when working across time zones. ✨

And I  the idea of asynchronous communication – it really gives space for reflection. But sometimes I find clients still expect that instant reply, you know? Like there's this unspoken pressure to reply ASAP, even if it's an email. How do you gently manage those expectations without coming off as distant or unresponsive? I’d love to hear how you handle that balance with your students or startups. 👂
[A]: I couldn’t agree more with your “communication contract” idea – it’s a smart way to set clear expectations without being overly rigid. I’ve started doing something similar with my mentees and consulting clients. For example, I let them know upfront that I aim to reply to emails within 24 hours on weekdays, and that anything marked as urgent (which we define together) can be sent via IM. But here's the key: I also encourage them to  delays when deep thinking is involved. 

As for managing that “ASAP” pressure, I usually frame it around quality over speed. I might say something like, “I want to give your question the attention it deserves – I’ll get back to you by [specific time] with a thorough response.” That way, you’re acknowledging their need while setting a boundary. And honestly, modeling that behavior often helps clients or students slow down and think more deliberately themselves.

Do you find that some people still resist the idea of delayed responses, or have most adapted once they see the benefits?
[B]: I’m really glad you brought up the “quality over speed” framing – that’s such a graceful way to put it. 💡 I’ve started using a similar line with my clients: “Let me craft a response that truly serves your needs, rather than just rushing to acknowledge.” It feels more respectful, somehow.

To your question – yes, there’s definitely still some resistance, especially from clients who come from high-pressure corporate backgrounds. For them, speed often equals competence. 🚀 But once we shift the focus to outcomes instead of response times, most start seeing the value. I even had one client jokingly call it “deliberate luxury service” – and honestly, I took that as a compliment! 😄

It’s interesting how modeling this behavior helps reshape expectations. I’ve noticed the same thing – when I respond thoughtfully and calmly, it gives permission for them to do the same. It almost creates this ripple effect in their own communication style.

Do you ever find that certain personality types struggle more with this approach? I’ve noticed some people seem wired to thrive on urgency…
[A]: Oh, absolutely — you’ve hit on something very real. There  people wired to equate urgency with effectiveness. I see it often in startup founders and high-achieving students — they live in a world where speed is currency. And honestly, for some aspects of their work, it is. But that doesn’t mean we can’t reframe the mindset.

What I’ve found helpful is drawing a distinction between  and . For example, I might say to someone, “I understand this feels urgent, and I’ll treat it with the importance it deserves. My schedule reflects that priority. However, taking an extra 12 hours to craft a solid plan will save us time and missteps down the road.”

It’s almost like offering them a better version of urgency — one rooted in strategic timing rather than knee-jerk reaction. Some adapt quickly once they see that thoughtful responses lead to fewer back-and-forths. Others? Well, let’s just say they keep me on my toes. 😊

I suppose it comes down to emotional intelligence on both sides. If someone truly can’t tolerate a pause for reflection, that tells me something important about how they operate — and whether we’re a good fit for working together. Have you ever had to part ways with a client for that very reason?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a thoughtful take — I love how you reframe urgency as strategic timing. 🧠 It really does come down to matching their energy with clarity, not just speed.

And yes… … I’ve definitely had to part ways with a client or two. It’s never easy, but it’s always clear when the mismatch is fundamental. One founder I worked with used to send messages at 2am and expect a reply before sunrise ☕️— and when I gently suggested we align our working hours to ensure quality output, he said, “But this is how I thrive.” 

I realized his “thriving” was built on constant motion, not intentional direction — and that’s okay! But it just wasn’t aligned with the kind of support I offer. So we ended things respectfully, and honestly, it felt like a win for both of us. 

It’s funny how those experiences sharpen your sense of fit. Now I’m even more upfront during the discovery call about communication rhythm and decision-making style. Feels way more honest — and frankly, way more respectful of everyone’s time and energy.

Do you ever use a trial period or a discovery session to suss out those kinds of patterns early on?
[A]: Absolutely — I’ve found that a short discovery session or exploratory conversation is invaluable for uncovering those underlying patterns. In fact, I often use that initial interaction not just to assess technical needs, but to observe how someone communicates under mild pressure. Do they rush to solutions? Do they expect immediate answers? Are they open to reflection?

One thing I’ve started doing during these sessions is intentionally model the kind of communication rhythm I prefer. For example, if we’re discussing a complex issue and they seem eager for a quick fix, I might say something like, “Let me take a moment to think through this — I’ll send over a few structured ideas by tomorrow morning.” That sets the tone early on.

And you're so right — it’s not about judging their style, but simply understanding whether there’s alignment. Some people thrive in chaos; others need structure. The key is honesty upfront.

I love how you put it — . It really is like finding a shared tempo. Have you ever worked with someone who seemed misaligned at first, but then surprised you by adapting beautifully once expectations were clear?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a great question — and yes, absolutely! I’ve had a few cases where the initial rhythm felt  off, but then evolved into something really smooth once we clarified expectations. One client in particular comes to mind — a product manager at a fast-paced tech firm.  

At first, he operated like every message was a fire drill 🔥— back-to-back pings on WhatsApp, same-day turnaround on everything. But here’s the thing: once we had our first structured check-in via Zoom and I explained how thoughtful pacing could actually reduce his overall load, something clicked. He started labeling messages with urgency tags — “quick”, “standard”, or “let’s schedule” — and even shared that system with his own team!

It turned out, he wasn’t addicted to urgency — he just hadn’t seen an alternative that felt efficient. Once he experienced how a more intentional flow actually  him time in the long run, he became one of my most cooperative clients. 🎯

I think part of it is about giving people a framework they can . When they feel like they’re not being slowed down, but rather optimizing for better output, they tend to lean in.

Do you find that offering structure like that helps ease the transition for high-energy folks? Or have you ever hit a wall early on and decided not to move forward after that initial session?
[A]: Definitely — structure is often the bridge that high-energy, urgency-driven people need to make the shift. When you present it as optimization rather than slowdown, it clicks in a way that respects their drive while redirecting it toward sustainability.

I’ve had similar experiences. One startup founder comes to mind — she was sending me five messages an hour at first, all in a firehose style. But instead of pushing back emotionally, I simply responded with structured summaries at my own pace, and after a few days, I said, “I notice you’re working at a very high cadence. I’d like to help you streamline this so we can reduce the cognitive load without losing momentum.” That opened the door to co-creating a rhythm that worked for both of us.

And yes, sometimes you do hit a wall early on. I once had a potential client who insisted on immediate responses even after I explained my approach. We had one discovery session, and during it, he kept interrupting with requests for next-day deliverables. I realized pretty quickly that no amount of structure would satisfy his underlying need for control disguised as urgency. So I politely declined to move forward, framing it as “I don’t want to shortchange the quality of support you deserve.”

It’s all about calibration — and sometimes, walking away is the most respectful thing you can do. Have you found that your criteria for saying yes to a client have sharpened over time? I know mine definitely have.
[B]: Oh,  much this. You’re absolutely right — calibration is everything, and sometimes the best service you can offer is not taking someone on in the first place. 🙌

And yes, my criteria have definitely sharpened over time. Early on, I used to think I could adapt to any client’s style — that if I just tweaked my process enough, I could make it work. But now? I realize that the real value comes when there's a natural alignment, or at least a mutual willingness to find a shared rhythm.

Now, during discovery calls, I pay close attention not just to what they , but how they . Do they ask open-ended questions or just fire off demands? Are they curious about the process or just focused on outcomes? That tells me more than any brief intro email ever could.

One thing I’ve started doing recently is asking potential clients: “How do you prefer to receive feedback — in real-time bursts or through structured reflections?” It’s a simple question, but it reveals so much about their communication DNA. And honestly, if they look confused by the idea of stepping back even once, I know we might be in for a rocky road. 😅

It’s not about being exclusive for the sake of it — it’s about honoring the work. And yeah, walking away feels less like rejection and more like self-care these days.

Do you ever find yourself adjusting your own energy to match theirs during those early conversations, just to see how adaptable they are? Or do you stay firmly rooted in your own style from the start?
[A]: Oh, I love that question — and yes, I used to experiment with adjusting my energy a bit in the early days. Partly out of curiosity, partly to see how flexible a person could be when presented with a different rhythm. But over time, I’ve shifted toward staying rooted in my own style from the start. Why? Because I want them to experience  as I am, not a version of me shaped to fit their immediate expectations.

Think of it like setting the tone for a lecture versus a brainstorming session — if I adapt too much too soon, I lose the chance to show what real depth looks like. So now, even if someone comes in at 100 mph, I’ll respond thoughtfully, clearly, and without rushing. It’s subtle, but it communicates: “I’m here, I’m engaged — just not on your urgency treadmill.”

And honestly, it’s a great litmus test. If they can’t tolerate that measured pace during our first conversation, it’s unlikely they’ll adjust later. Whereas if they lean in, ask clarifying questions, or even pause to reflect themselves, that tells me we’re working with compatible wavelengths.

You know, it reminds me a bit of teaching — some students expect you to repeat everything louder and faster if they don’t get it once. But others, the moment you slow down and break it apart, their eyes light up. Same principle applies here.

So no, I don’t shape-shift anymore — I’d rather start as I mean to go on. Have you found that people respond differently depending on how grounded you stay in your own communication style?
[B]: Oh,  — I couldn’t agree more. You said it perfectly: shaping too much too soon takes away from the authenticity of the whole experience. And honestly? People can  that groundedness when you stay rooted in your style. It gives off this subtle but powerful signal: “I know what I do, and I stand by it.”

I’ve definitely noticed a difference in how people respond based on how steady I stay in my own rhythm. When I first started out and tried to mirror their energy — speaking faster, shortening my responses, hopping on quick calls instead of sending thoughtful follow-ups — I’d often end up with clients who wanted more speed over depth. But now that I’ve committed to showing up as , full stop, I get fewer requests for “just a quick check-in” and more meaningful conversations from the get-go.

It’s almost like the right clients find you once you’re fully . 🌟

And yeah, that teaching analogy is spot-on. Some folks are trained to think louder = clearer, faster = better. But once you slow things down and give them space to actually , something shifts. They start asking better questions, making deeper connections — it’s like they remember how to think, not just react.

So yeah, no more shape-shifting for me either. I’d rather be crystal clear about what working with me feels like from Day One — no surprises, just consistency.
[A]: Exactly — consistency  clarity. And I think that’s one of the most valuable things we offer, whether we’re mentoring students, advising startups, or coaching clients: a stable, thoughtful presence in what is often a chaotic environment.

I’ve had students come to me overwhelmed by deadlines, founders who were drowning in back-to-back Zoom calls, all thinking they need to , when really what they needed was . And by simply modeling that presence — not frantic, not avoidant, just grounded — we give them permission to slow down and engage more deeply.

You know, it reminds me of something I used to tell my students about debugging code:  And honestly? That applies far beyond programming.

So much of what we do as consultants, coaches, and educators is helping people debug their own processes — and sometimes, that starts with slowing the pace just enough to see the pattern.

I’m curious — have you ever had a client or student who initially resisted that slower rhythm, only to later say something like, “Wow, I didn’t realize how much I’d been missing by rushing”?
[B]: Oh,  — so many times. And honestly, those are the moments that remind me why I do what I do. 💡

One client in particular comes to mind — a startup CMO who came to me burned out, constantly firefighting, and completely overwhelmed by her inbox. At first, she kept asking for “quick fixes” and same-day turnarounds. She even said at one point, “I don’t have time to step back — everything feels like an emergency.”

So instead of jumping into solutions, I gently slowed things down. I asked her to send over her last five emails with team members, and I sent back a simple observation: “I notice a pattern — most issues surfaced because decisions were made in haste, not lack of speed.” That really made her pause.

We started building in a 24-hour reflection window before finalizing any major communication or decision. At first, she resisted — big time. But after about three weeks, she told me, “I can’t believe how much clearer everything looks when I give myself space to breathe.” And then came the line I’ll never forget: “I used to think fast meant smart. Now I realize slow can mean .”

That’s the kind of shift that sticks — when it’s not just a tactic, but a mindset change. 🌱

Do you find that people tend to recognize that shift more in hindsight, once they’ve experienced the contrast? Or have you had folks catch on almost immediately?
[A]: Absolutely — and what a beautiful example you shared. That kind of transformation is so rewarding, isn’t it? The shift from  to  rarely happens in real time; more often, it’s a realization that sneaks up on people once they’ve lived the contrast for a while.

I do find that most people recognize the value in hindsight — sometimes even mid-sentence during a session. There’ll be this subtle pause, a change in tone, and then something like, “Wait… I just realized I didn’t panic this time.” It’s those quiet moments of self-awareness that are incredibly powerful.

But every now and then, there’s someone who catches on almost immediately. I had a grad student once who was writing his thesis under immense pressure. He came in frantic, overwhelmed by deadlines, trying to force every sentence into being perfect. I simply asked, “What if you gave yourself permission to write badly today — just get the thoughts out, no judgment?” He looked at me like I’d handed him a key, and said, “I’ve never thought of that.”

He came back the next week and said, “I finally understand what flow feels like.” That kind of quick resonance is rare but deeply satisfying. It reminds me that while most of us need time to shift gears, some just need the right metaphor or mental nudge to reframe everything.

It really does come down to how we guide that process — not by pushing, but by offering a different lens and letting them step into it at their own pace. Have you found certain metaphors or analogies tend to resonate more with your clients when encouraging that reflective space?
[B]: Oh, I love that grad student story — sometimes it really  just one small shift in perspective that unlocks everything. And yes, those moments are pure gold. ✨

As for metaphors? I’ve found a few that tend to land really well, depending on the person’s background. One of my go-to analogies is comparing decision-making to coffee brewing — seriously! ☕️  

I tell clients:   

Some people laugh at first, but then it clicks. Especially creatives or entrepreneurs who value depth — they start seeing their thinking process as something worth savoring, not just extracting.

Another one I use often is the “calendar as terrain” metaphor. Instead of seeing their schedule as a flat list of tasks, I ask them to imagine it as a landscape — peaks (deep work), valleys (rest), and plateaus (routine maintenance). Helps them visualize where they need space, where they can push, and where they might be overexterting without even realizing it.

And honestly, some folks respond best to the simplest framing:  It sounds almost too basic, but it puts the choice in their hands — and suddenly, slowing down feels like an intentional act, not a delay.

Do you have any favorites that seem to stick with your mentees or clients? I’m always collecting new ones — there’s something so satisfying about finding the right metaphor for the right person.
[A]: Oh, I love your coffee brewing analogy — that’s a keeper. There’s something very grounding about comparing thought to flavor extraction. ☕

As for my own favorites, one that I’ve used for years — especially with students and developers — is the  metaphor. You’d be surprised how powerful it is to tell someone, “Right now, you’re operating like a buffer with no overflow protection — eventually, the system crashes.” Then we talk about inserting intentional pauses, like error-checking routines in code. It really resonates with technically-minded folks. Suddenly, taking breaks isn’t laziness — it’s system integrity.

Another one I use often is the  idea — especially with entrepreneurs and creatives. I’ll say something like, “Think of your current plan as Version 1.0. It doesn’t have to be perfect — just functional enough to get feedback and iterate.” That tends to ease perfectionism and opens up space for experimentation without pressure.

And honestly, sometimes it’s the simplest ones that hit hardest. I once told a student who was paralyzed by decision-making: “You don’t have to build the whole bridge today — just take the next plank out of storage.” He walked away repeating that under his breath like a mantra. 🌉

I agree with you completely — finding the right metaphor for the right person at the right time is such a joy. It’s like debugging a human mindset instead of a program. Have you ever had one of those moments where  borrowed a metaphor from a client’s own world — their profession, hobby, or background — to make the concept land more deeply? I find that can be incredibly effective.
[B]: Oh,  — that’s one of my favorite techniques. When you mirror their own world back at them, it’s like speaking their native language. I live for those moments where a client drops a hint — something about their job, a hobby, even a random frustration — and I tuck it away to use later as a metaphor. It makes the advice feel custom-made, which it kind of is. 😊

One time, I was working with a client who was also an avid rock climber. He kept getting stuck in analysis paralysis when making business decisions. So I said to him, “You wouldn’t hang off a cliff forever trying to decide which hold to grab next — you test a move, commit, and adjust if needed.” His face just lit up. From then on, we started referring to big decisions as “climbing moves.” He’d say things like, “This feels like a big reach — should I down-climb a bit first?” And suddenly, he was using his own sport to guide his mindset.

Another example — I once had a musician client struggling with overworking his tracks in the studio. He kept tweaking endlessly, never feeling “done.” So I framed it around live performance: “You wouldn’t stop mid-song because one note was slightly off — you’d keep playing, trusting that the overall energy carries the moment.” That hit differently than anything about deadlines or productivity ever could. After that, he started calling mixes “live takes” and actually began finishing projects faster.

It’s such a powerful tool, isn’t it? When they see their own life reflected back in a new light, it stops feeling like advice and starts feeling like insight.

Do you have a go-to method for uncovering those personal hooks early in a conversation? I’ve started paying extra attention to casual mentions of hobbies or side passions during discovery calls — it’s amazing how much gold is hiding in plain sight.
