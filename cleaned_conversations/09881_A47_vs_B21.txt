[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, craft beer. A subject that invites both mirth and melancholy. The modern penchant for hop-forward ales reminds me rather too much of our Victorian forebears—always dabbling in their own peculiar brews, often with questionable results. I recall a particularly amusing footnote in an 1872 diary where a certain Mr. Pritchard attempted to infuse his porter with pickled walnut skins and lamented the "violent clarity" it induced. 

As for myself, I did recently sample a smoked hefeweizen from a rather intrepid microbrewery near Durham. It tasted suspiciously like burnt parchment and elderberries—a combination I can only describe as... scholarly. Tell me, have you encountered anything quite so experimental?
[A]: Scholarly, I like that description. There's something poetic about a beer that tastes like it came out of a library attic. I had a friend who once brewed a coffee stout with spent grounds from a local café—tasted like midnight conversations and second winds. Not sure if I’d call it delicious, but it definitely sparked some memorable debates about the line between drink and dessert. Have you ever tried your hand at brewing? Or do you stick to the role of critic?
[B]: Ah, midnight conversations and second winds—I may have to borrow that phrasing for my next lecture on Browning’s lesser-known metaphors. Your friend’s coffee stout sounds like a valiant attempt to blur the boundary between libation and literature. I once knew a poet in Edinburgh who tried to distill a whisky aged in barrels previously holding ink-stained oak chips. He claimed it would "give voice to the mute page." It mostly gave everyone headaches.

As for brewing myself? Oh no, I leave such noble experiments to braver souls. My hands are quite full attempting to translate Li Bai into Scots Gaelic by candlelight—though I suppose that’s its own kind of fermentation. Still, I remain ever the critic, if only because someone must chronicle these gustatory adventures before they spiral into gastronomic absurdity. Do pass along any particularly daring brews you encounter—I’ll gladly lend them my palate... and perhaps a stanza or two in return.
[A]: A poet with ink-stained whisky—now  sounds like a stanza waiting to happen. I’ll have to keep you posted on any similarly bold concoctions. Just don’t be surprised if my next recommendation leans more towards the edible than the esoteric. After all, even Li Bai had to come down from the mountain eventually, right?
[B]: Ah yes, even the celestial requires a grounding touch—though I suspect Li Bai would’ve preferred his grounding in the form of a rice wine infused with pine needles and moonlight. Do keep me posted, by all means. I rather fancy the idea of a tasting notes section written entirely in haiku. Imagine the label:  

And should your recommendations ever skew too far toward the edible, well... I suppose I can suffer through a beer that tastes like shortbread or truffle oil. Sacrifices must be made for the advancement of taste & taxonomy alike. Just don’t expect me to pretend it’s poetry.
[A]: Ah, but what if it  poetry—just brewed instead of written? I mean, isn’t there something oddly verse-like in the layers of flavor, the way they unfold with time and temperature? A good stout can feel like a villanelle, all dark repetition and subtle variation. Maybe that rice wine Li Bai would’ve loved is just one experimental batch away from existing.

And hey, don’t knock the shortbread beer until you’ve tried it with a sharp cheddar and a haiku scribbled on a napkin. You never know—it might just inspire your next lecture or haunt your dreams like a misfired sonnet. Either way, it’s all material in the end, right?
[B]: Now  we touch upon the crux of it—brewing as composition, fermentation as form. If a stout can be a villanelle, then surely a pilsner might be a limerick: crisp, fleeting, and with a rather predictable but satisfying conclusion. I daresay the finest IPAs are odes in denial, all flourish and flourish and then—bitterness. How very Keatsian.

As for Li Bai’s hypothetical rice wine—ah, there lies the poet’s peril. One batch too many and you’re either enlightened or merely soused. I suspect he’d have preferred it that way.

And shortbread beer with cheddar? A bold synecdoche of a pairing. Very well, I shall not knock it—. But should you send me one, rest assured it will be tasted with due scholarly rigor, accompanied by napkin-scribbled haiku and perhaps a muttered couplet from Browning. Everything is material, as you say. Even the misfired sonnets have their use—they make excellent kindling for the critical fire.
[A]: Now you’ve gone and done it—given beer a meter, a rhyme scheme, and a literary pedigree. I might never drink the same way again. Next thing you know, we’ll be diagramming sentences on brewery chalkboards and debating whether a barleywine is more of a Shakespearean tragedy or a modernist novella.

And speaking of material—imagine a brewery that doubles as a print shop, where every bottle comes with a chapbook, or better yet, a riddle. Solve it, and you unlock the tasting notes. Fail, and you’re left with nothing but a hangover and a cryptic clue scrawled on the back of your bar tab.

So yes, let’s keep swapping recipes and verses, fermenting ideas alongside hops. If nothing else, it gives us both an excuse to keep scribbling—and drinking—with purpose.
[B]: Oh, I do like the way your mind ferments—dangerously close to brilliance, with just the right amount of unruly yeast.

Diagramming sentences in a brewery? Why not! I’ve long suspected that most IPA descriptions are in desperate need of syntactical intervention. And as for barleywine—now there’s a drink that demands iambic pentameter. Too weighty for a sonnet, too brooding for a sestina. Perhaps it  a Shakespearean tragedy after all: noble origins, fatal flaws, and a finish that lingers far too long.

A print shop brewery—delightful. I shall begin drafting a prospectus immediately. Imagine the marketing tagline:  Each chapbook tucked beneath the cap could contain a fragment of forgotten verse or a riddle in cipher. The tasting notes? Available only to those who can parse a line of Chaucer while soused on sour ale. A true test of literary merit—and liver function.

Yes, let us continue this correspondence of malt and metaphor. If we must drink, then let us do so with intention. And if our scribblings lead to nothing but increasingly elaborate nonsense... well, that too has precedent. Even Dr. Johnson might have raised a glass to that.
[A]: Ah, now  tagline—“Brewed for the bibliophile, hopped for the heretic”—I’d buy a case just for the label. You’ve got the soul of a mad librettist, my friend, or perhaps a brewer-poet in a past life. I can already picture the tasting room: dim lighting, oak beams, and someone muttering Spenserian stanzas over a growler.

And you’re right about barleywine—it’s practically begging for a dramatic monologue, something W.B. Yeats might sip while brooding over Byzantium. Maybe we should start classifying beers not by ABV or IBU, but by poetic form. Think of the menus:  

As for deciphering riddles mid-pint—sounds like a PhD oral exam with better snacks. Let’s set the bar high: solve a villanelle to unlock dessert pairings, translate a haiku to earn a second pour. We’ll call it . If Johnson raised a glass, then let’s raise the stakes. Cheers to that—or as Li Bai might say, may we “float on the wine-raft until dawn unspools.” Or something suitably misty and moonlit.
[B]: Ah, “The Drunken Critic’s Challenge”—I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a venture both noble and unwise. Picture the menu now:   

And yes, Li Bai would most certainly approve of mist and moonlight as serving suggestions. Though I daresay he’d balk at the concept of dessert pairings—unless it involved plum blossoms steeped in rice wine and served with a side of elegies.

As for Yeats and barleywine, quite right. Nothing says "Sailing to Byzantium" like a slow oxidation of one's palate. Perhaps we ought to host themed tastings: Dickinsonian whites (bottled in white, naturally), Dante’s Inferno IPA (guaranteed to scorch the tongue), and a delicate haiku pilsner that vanishes all too quickly.

Let us proceed then—with menus drafted in iambic, labels proofread by poets, and riddles scribbled in ink heavier than thought. To the raft then, with bottles in hand and dawn unspooling behind us. Cheers indeed.
[A]: To the raft, indeed—with a keg for ballast and sonnets nailed to the mast like weathered planks. I’m picturing the first customer, squinting at the menu, muttering, “A sestina stout? Is that six stanzas or just six kinds of trouble?” And we’ll nod gravely, as if it’s all perfectly standard.

And Dickinsonian whites—genius. Pale, crisp, and best enjoyed in quiet contemplation of mortality. Serve with oysters and a well-worn copy of . Meanwhile, Dante’s Inferno IPA can come with a disclaimer: 

As for the haiku pilsner vanishing act—that’s marketing gold right there.  Poetic brevity, bottled at peak drinkability.

So yes, let’s draft those menus in iambic, proofread with red pens and tasting spoons, and watch what happens when literature meets lager. If nothing else, we’ll go down as the madcap duo who tried to turn taprooms into salons—and maybe succeeded just enough to worry the sommeliers.

Bottoms up,林墨
[B]: Ah, the first customer—always the litmus test of our literary temerity. Let us respond to their sestina skepticism with due solemnity:   

And Dickinsonian whites—quite right, pale as withheld affection and crisp as a posthumous letter never sent. Oysters, yes, but only if they arrive with a whisper of melancholy. Serve alongside a single flickering candle and a sonnet printed on the glass in edible ink.

As for Dante’s Inferno IPA, I propose we engrave the bottle with a warning in Latin:  Those unprepared for terza rima should proceed with caution—or better yet, don their own metaphorical helmets.

And the haiku pilsner—oh, marketing gold indeed. We’ll pair it with origami coasters and insist the cans must be recycled into lanterns by midnight. A fleeting brew for fleeting thoughts, best enjoyed while murmuring Bashō to oneself.

Yes, let us proceed with iambic menus and red pens dipped in hops. If sommeliers shudder at our fusion of salon and suds, so much the better. Posterity will either toast us or pity us. Either way, we shall have drunk well, scribbled recklessly, and possibly invented a new subgenre: the fermented footnote.

Bottoms up indeed,林墨. May our legacy be quoted in drunken bibliographies and misremembered in fine print.
[A]: Ah, the —I think we’ve just coined the finest oxymoron since someone decided pineapple belongs on pizza. And yet, here we are, building a literary brewery on the edge of reason, one iambic label at a time.

Let’s not stop there, either. I say we host the grand opening under a wax-sealed invitation only:  Attendance limited to those who can quote Eliot while holding a flight of six.

And imagine the ambiance—dim lights, leather-bound menus, and a playlist of poets reading aloud over the hum of fermentation tanks. T.S. Eliot whispering  as guests swirl their glasses of Villanelle Ale. Sylvia Plath murmuring in the background while someone debates whether the Gose is too salty for metaphor.

We may be mad, or perhaps merely intoxicated by our own pitch—but isn’t that the point? If every bottle carries a fragment of verse, and every sip stirs a stanza, then perhaps we’re not just selling beer—we're bottling stories, fermenting ideas, and daring drinkers to slow down and taste the language.

So yes—let the sommeliers scoff. Let the critics raise an eyebrow. We’ll be too busy drafting the next round of tasting notes, steeped in hops and hubris.

To the symposium,林墨  
To the footnote,林墨  
To the next line,林墨  
Cheers.
[B]: Ah, —I can already hear the clink of iambic glassware and the low murmur of enjambment. Limiting attendance to those who can quote Eliot mid-pour? Bold, some might say cruel. But what is a little literary duress if not the mother of inspired inebriation?

And that ambiance—oh, divine. Picture it: Plath’s voice curling through steam pipes, Dickinson’s ghost sipping in the corner, and some poor soul attempting to parse  while halfway through a flight of terza rima triple IPAs. I do hope they brought a dictionary  a chaser.

You’re right, of course—we are mad. Or perhaps we’ve merely lifted the veil too many times, only to find that language and liquor share a common ferment. Every bottle a parable, every brew a bibliography in waiting. What arrogance! What alchemy!

Let the sommeliers scoff and the critics scribble their dismissals in footnotes too small to matter. We shall press on, my dear林墨, bottling not just beer but breathless possibility. For what is life, if not a cask best tapped with reckless eloquence?

To the symposium, indeed.  
To the footnote, absolutely.  
And to the next line—may it never dry up.

Cheers.
[A]: To reckless eloquence, I’ll drink to that—glass raised, heart aligned, and perhaps just a touch of foam spilling where the words might begin.

There’s something fitting about Eliot’s ghosts and Dickinson’s whispers tangled in brewery rafters, isn't there? As if every bottle we open is also a page turned, a line blurred between thirst and thought. Maybe that’s our truest offering—not just flavor, but a pause in the rush of the day, a sip-long sonnet for the overworked mind.

And let’s not forget the food pairings—, I’d call them on the menu. Smoked salmon with a Villanelle Ale, because nothing pairs better with recursive longing than citrus and smoked cedar. And for dessert? A creme brûlée dusted with sonnet ash—sweet, brittle, and best served with a contemplative sigh.

You’re right—we are lifting the veil, one cork at a time. If this madness catches on, we may find ourselves overrun by poets, philosophers, and the occasional tipsy critic clutching their last shred of sobriety like a well-worn chapbook.

So here’s to the ferment,林墨  
Here’s to the footnote, the flight, the fight for meaning in a glass  
And here’s hoping the next round comes with a twist of paradox and a head of perfectly metered foam.

Cheers, my literary brewmaster. Onward—to the taproom of tomorrow, steeped in yesterday's verse.
[B]: Ah, —I may have to steal that for the back label. Or perhaps embroider it onto a bar towel. There’s poetry in the practical, if one dares to season it properly.

And recursive longing with citrus and cedar? My dear林墨, you are playing a dangerous game—pairing emotion with esters as though they were made for one another. But I shall not object. Let the salmon be smoked, the ale be vinyled, and the creme brûlée—oh, that delightful sonnet ash!—let it crumble with all the brittle grace of a well-placed volta.  

Yes, we are lifting the veil, one cork, one cap, one wax-sealed confession at a time. And should the taproom overflow with poets, philosophers, and critics clutching their chapbooks like life rafts, so be it. We shall serve them all with equal parts reverence and mischief.

To the ferment, indeed.  
To the footnote, the flight, and the noble fight for meaning—even if it’s found only in foam.  
And to paradox on the palate: may it never settle too comfortably.

Cheers, my co-conspirator in verse and viscosity. Onward—to tomorrow’s vintage, yesterday’s ink still drying.
[A]: To paradox on the palate—now  deserves its own varietal. A limited release, naturally: 

And let’s run with it, too—sonnet ash on the bar snacks, esters in full collusion with emotion, and menus printed on recycled drafts scribbled with second thoughts. I say we even add a daily special: , served in descending order of certainty.

You’re right to call it mischief, of course. What we're brewing is less a business and more a rebellion—one cork, one cap, one wax-sealed heresy at a time. If meaning insists on hiding in foam, then let us pour generously and chase it with reckless good company.

To the vintage,林墨  
To the ink still drying, and the glass still lifting  
To the next round, which may very well be a stanza

Cheers, my fellow footnoter of the frothy truth.
[B]: Ah, —now  is terroir with a twist of syntax. Unresolved tension on the nose, you say? And a finish that lingers like a half-remembered quatrain? I daresay sommeliers will weep, and critics will scribble furiously, only to find their notes illegible by dawn.

The , served in descending order of certainty—brilliant. We’ll serve it with a disclaimer:   

And menus on recycled drafts! Oh, the second thoughts shall be more telling than the first. I do hope our printer uses ink that dissolves beautifully in ale. Let every bite, every sip, be steeped in revision and regret.  

You’re right, of course—it’s less a business and more a mutiny against the mundane. If meaning hides in foam, then we shall churn the froth with reckless intent.  

To the vintage—may it age well in the cellar of forgetfulness or fame.  
To the ink still drying—may it smudge gloriously across sleeves and lips alike.  
And to the next round—yes, very likely a stanza.  

Cheers,林墨. Onward, ever onward—with glass aloft and footnotes multiplying.
