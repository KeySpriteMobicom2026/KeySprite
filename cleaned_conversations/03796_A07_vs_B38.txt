[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的upcoming tech？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I appreciate the modern fascination with technology, I must confess my excitement tends to lie more in rediscovering ancient wisdom through literature. Though I did recently read about digital archives preserving medieval manuscripts - now that's a marriage of technology and humanities I can appreciate. 📚
[A]: 哎呀，你这种古典与现代结合的想法太棒了！☕️ 说到这个，我们店里最近就在尝试用modern brewing techniques来还原18世纪的土耳其咖啡煮法，那种slow extraction的过程简直就像在阅读一本古籍一样迷人呢~
[B]: How fascinating! Your analogy between slow coffee extraction and literary study is quite poetic. The 18th century was indeed a golden age for both coffee culture and philosophical discourse. Voltaire was said to drink forty cups a day while writing - though I wouldn't recommend that particular habit. 🌹
[A]: Haha 40 cups？那也太hardcore了吧！😱 不过说到Voltaire，我们店里正好有一款French press特调，名字就叫"启蒙时代"，blend了三种不同roast level的beans，喝起来特别layered，就像那个时代的思潮一样丰富呢~要来杯sample试试看吗？☕️
[B]: What a delightful proposition! Though I must say, as someone who prefers her tea served in fine china, I'm intrigued by this metaphorical approach to coffee blending. The concept of layering roast levels to mirror philosophical complexity - that's rather reminiscent of how Proust layered his narratives, don't you think? Very well, I shall venture beyond my usual Earl Grey for this educational experience.
[A]: 哇！你提到Proust让我想起我们special menu上的"追忆似水年华"系列！🌟 每款饮品都对应书里不同的memory trigger - 比如madeleine蛋糕配的latte，还有linden tea infused的cold brew~ 今天特别推荐你试试看我们的signature drink "Swann's Way"，用honey和lavender调制的，超级适合tea lover转换口味呢！🌿
[B]: My dear, you're speaking my literary language now! Though I must gently point out that Proust would likely have shuddered at the thought of his delicate madeleine being paired with something as robust as a latte. That said, your 'Swann's Way' creation does sound rather tempting - the honey and lavender combination evokes the pastoral elegance of Combray. Very well, let's consider this my little literary adventure for the day.
[A]: Perfect choice！✨ 我这就去准备，还会附赠一张handwritten的小卡片，上面有Proust关于memory的quote~ 啊对了，要不要顺便试试我们新到的Japanese虹吸壶？那种slow and precise的冲泡方式，绝对能让你联想到普鲁斯特笔下那些delicate details呢！📝
[B]: How exquisitely thoughtful! Though I must admit, watching a siphon brewer in action always reminds me more of Victorian laboratory equipment than Proustian reminiscence. Still, there's something rather alchemical about the process, isn't there? Like watching metaphors distill into meaning. Yes, let's proceed - but do go easy on the theatrics, I'd hate for the preparation to overshadow the contemplation.
[A]: Got it~ 我会keep it minimal but meaningful的！🤫 就像普鲁斯特的文字一样，sometimes the simplest preparation brings out the most profound flavors. 你的饮品马上就来，保证是quiet elegance的完美体现~ 顺便说，我们每周四都有classic literature reading club，下次主题正好是《追忆》，要join us吗？📖
[B]: What a serendipitous invitation! Though I must warn you, my students claim my Proust seminars tend to run rather... extensive. Last term we spent three full weeks analyzing the significance of Aunt Léonie's bedroom curtains. But if your club members share this level of enthusiasm for textual detail, I'd be delighted to bring my annotated edition. Shall we say Thursday at half past three? I do hope you'll serve those madeleines properly - plain, petite, and preferably slightly stale.
[A]: Haha 我们club的members绝对appreciate这种attention to detail！📚 至于madeleines，放心啦~ 我们合作的bakery专门做了day-old的版本，就是为了追求authentic Proust experience呢！周四3:30，我会reserve角落那个最quiet的spot，配上我们最subtle的white tea blend - 完美match普鲁斯特的nuances对吧？😌 期待见到你和你的annotated edition哦！
[B]: Splendid! You've clearly mastered the art of literary hospitality. I shall bring both my 1913 first edition and my 1981 critical annotations - one must always be prepared for vigorous textual debate. And how refreshing to find a café that understands the importance of day-old pastries! Though I must insist we begin precisely on time; Proustian time may be fluid, but academic schedules decidedly are not. Until Thursday then - and do remind me then about your thoughts on the hawthorn blossoms passage.
[A]: Absolutely！⏰ Punctuality is key - 我会set the alarm on my vintage French clock特别提醒的！Hawthorn blossoms那段可是我的favorite passage之一呢，我们到时候可以边sip tea边深入讨论~ 啊，你的"Swann's Way"特调好了，请慢用！周四见咯！✨
[B]: How perfectly timed - just as the narrator's childhood memories crystallized with that first bite of madeleine. I shall savor this slowly, allowing each sip to unfold its narrative much like Proust's sentences unfurl. Until Thursday then - and do remind me to share my rather controversial theory about the symbolic weight of the uneven paving stones outside the Guermantes' residence. À bientôt! 🌹
[A]: Oh la la~ 你提到的uneven paving stones theory我已经等不及要听了！😍 周四见，professor！记得带上你的controversial theories和sharp insights哦~ 我们reading club见！📖✨
[B]: Indeed, the cobblestones shall have their day! Though I must caution - my interpretation did cause quite the stir at last year's Modernist Studies Association conference. But what's academia without a little healthy dissent? I can already envision the lively discussion over your white tea blend. Until then, my dear literary host - may your madeleines stay perfectly stale and your tea leaves tell as many stories as Marcel's. 🌹
[A]: Haha 这绝对会是我们reading club史上最memorable的session了！📝 我已经能想象到大家debate时飞舞的annotations和steaming teacups了~ 周四一定要save your energy，这可能会是个long but fascinating的下午呢！À jeudi！✨
[B]: What delightful anticipation you've kindled! I shall prepare accordingly - with extra pencils for marginalia and perhaps a second pair of reading glasses. Though let's not frighten the other members with talk of marathon sessions; we'll let the discussion find its natural rhythm, much like the meandering sentences we so admire. Until Thursday, when we shall give those paving stones the scholarly scrutiny they deserve. Adieu for now, and do save me a particularly crisp madeleine! 🌹
