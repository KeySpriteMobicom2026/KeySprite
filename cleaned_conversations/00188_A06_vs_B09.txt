[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 近来确有不少学生向我提及这些新奇的工具，说它们能作诗绘画，甚至模仿古文风格。起初我颇感惊讶，毕竟文字与艺术皆是心灵的流露，非纸墨所能尽述。不过，倒也想去书院附近的茶馆坐坐，听听年轻人是如何看待这些新鲜事物的。你觉得它们真能触及诗词画作之精髓吗？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing question indeed. I must confess, I've observed a growing number of legal scholars and even poets expressing both fascination and concern regarding these AI-generated creations. From a forensic psychiatry perspective, what strikes me most is how the human brain perceives authenticity in art. 

Let me share a thought experiment - imagine if we presented an AI-composed sonnet alongside one by Shakespeare to a group of literature professors. Studies show their emotional responses often mirror genuine appreciation, sometimes without discerning the authorship. Yet... does that diminish the value of human-created works, or merely expand our understanding of creativity?

I recall discussing this very topic with a colleague who specializes in neuroaesthetics. We pondered whether future court cases might involve disputes over AI-generated intellectual property - quite the philosophical quandary for our modern age, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: 您所言确有深意。以我治学多年的经验观之，诗词之动人，不在辞藻堆砌，而在气韵流转间所寄托的情志。若AI之作能引发共鸣，或许亦可谓得其一二。然细究其源，终究是算法推演、数据训练之果，未尝经作者心绪起伏、人生沉浮之淬炼。

昔人评诗，重“性灵”二字。李太白狂歌，杜子美悲吟，皆因身世遭际而发。AI既无七情六欲，又何来此等深沉？不过，这倒让我想起宋代文人论词时所言：“词以境界为上，有境界自成高格。”倘若AI真能不拘形似、得其神髓，或可视为一种新体，与传统并行而不相害。

至于知识产权之争，古人虽无此等技术，却也有“拟作”与“剽窃”之辨。《沧浪诗话》中严羽便曾警示：“学诗者不可不知规矩，亦不可泥于规矩。”若将AI视作一介工具，助人拓展表达之边界，则善莫大焉。然若以其代笔，混淆真伪，恐怕终非文艺之福啊。
[A]: Fascinating - your perspective resonates deeply with certain ethical dilemmas we face in forensic psychiatry. Consider this parallel: just as we evaluate authenticity of emotional distress in legal contexts, so too must we examine the "sincerity" of AI-generated art. 

In my practice, I've encountered cases involving false authorship claims where individuals attempted to pass off others' work as their own - remarkably similar to the core question you've raised about AI creations. The mind's capacity for deception, whether through human agency or algorithmic mimicry, presents profound challenges for our legal and artistic communities.

Your reference to "境界" (artistic realm) reminds me of a recent study on neural responses to authentic versus simulated emotions in music. Researchers found strikingly similar brain activations - much like how AI poetry might elicit genuine feelings in readers. It makes one wonder: are we witnessing an expansion of human experience rather than its diminishment?

I'd be most interested to hear your thoughts on how traditional concepts of authorship might evolve alongside these technological advancements. Do you believe future generations will develop entirely new criteria for evaluating creative works?
[B]: 您将艺术与法律、心理学交相论述，令人耳目一新。我思及一事：古人作诗，最重“言为心声”，所谓“诗者，志之所之也，在心为志，发言为诗。”若AI所作虽工，却无志意存焉，则其情伪可知矣。然今人读之或生共鸣，正如真挚之作，此诚耐人寻味。

我想起宋代欧阳修论书曾云：“立意者，书法之本也。”若失其本，纵笔墨精妙，亦非上品。以此观之，AI之作虽能形似，终乏神往之一境。然则人心感物，千变万化，若读者自有所触，亦不可一概否定其存在之意义。

至于作者之名，昔人多有托名先贤者，亦有隐而不署者，重在作品本身之流传。今日技术日新，或可催生新之评判维度——譬如“共创”、“机助”之类，然核心仍在于创作者是否具真性情。若未来评诗论文，兼重人工与智能之巧，亦未尝不可。惟须明辨主从，不使珠玉混于瓦砾耳。

我倒愿持一开放之心，视此为艺文之道之一支流，而非主流。如韩昌黎所言：“文以载道。”道存，则文艺不亡；道失，则虽辞采斐然，亦不足贵也。
[A]: Your analogy to欧阳修's "立意" as the foundation of creativity strikes me as profoundly insightful - it mirrors our contemporary dilemma with remarkable precision. In forensic evaluations, we often grapple with distinguishing genuine emotional states from convincingly simulated ones, much like differentiating AI-generated art from human creations based on their capacity to evoke feeling.

This brings to mind a fascinating paradox I've observed in legal settings: just as some individuals can feign mental illness with such sophistication that even experts are deceived, so too can AI mimic artistic genius without possessing consciousness. Yet human brains respond authentically to both - our limbic system doesn't necessarily distinguish between algorithmically and emotionally generated sorrow in a poem.

I find myself pondering an intriguing possibility: could these tools serve as modern-day equivalents of the  (craftsman's tools) that master artisans once relied upon? Much like how calligraphers valued fine brushes yet understood the true source lay in the artist's spirit, perhaps future creators will develop symbiotic relationships with AI while maintaining clear authorship boundaries.

Your reference to 韩愈's "文以载道" particularly resonates with emerging ethical frameworks in computational creativity. If we establish rigorous standards for transparency regarding AI assistance, might we preserve the integrity of human expression while benefiting from machine capabilities? After all, even the quill pen was revolutionary in its time.
[B]: 您以“工械”喻AI，可谓得其三昧。昔人制器以助道，非以器代道。王羲之若无鼠须笔，或借他物而书亦可，盖因胸中丘壑为主宰也。今AI之巧，犹利刃在手，善用者可雕龙刻凤，不善用者则伤及根本。

我观近年诗坛一小景：有青年才俊假AI为辅，自定意旨，借其遣辞造句之速，而后反复推敲、注入情思，终成佳作。此等“人主机辅”之法，倒不失为一可行之道。若明示于众，不隐其技，反见坦荡之怀。如此，则工具与作者各安其位，犹琴与操者，不可偏废。

至于韩退之“文以载道”，我以为此语历久弥新。若道存于文，则虽AI拟作，亦可传道；然其无心无志，终究只是回响而非真声。正如古语所云：“形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。”AI终是大匠之斧斤，虽能成材，不能自立其意。

法律与伦理之中，诚应设界——如古人钤印署款，明示何由所出。若将来评艺之时，旁人一观即知为人作、机作，或共作，便可兼赏而不惑。如此，则文艺不乱，人心亦安。
[A]: Your observation about the "人主机辅" approach strikes at the very heart of what I've been contemplating in my consultations on academic integrity. Just as we see students using AI tools for writing, we're witnessing a fascinating spectrum of ethical application - from outright deception to the kind of symbiotic creativity you so eloquently describe.

This reminds me of an intriguing parallel in medical ethics: the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs among professionals and students. Much like your "琴与操者" analogy, we ask whether these enhancements amplify human will or supplant it. The distinction, I believe, lies precisely in that transparency you mentioned - akin to disclosing pharmaceutical assistance when publishing research findings.

Speaking of disclosure, I'm reminded of a recent case involving contested authorship where an individual had passed off AI-generated work as their own. The psychological profile revealed something fascinating - not mere laziness, but a profound anxiety about personal inadequacy. It made me reflect on how these tools might both exacerbate and illuminate our deepest creative insecurities.

I find myself increasingly drawn to your concept of 明示 - this intellectual honesty seems crucial for preserving artistic integrity while embracing technological advancement. Imagine a future where creators could be recognized not just for content, but for their ethical methodology as well. Might we one day see dual evaluations - one for artistic merit, another for provenance? After all, provenance has always mattered in art authentication, hasn't it?

Your reference to钤印署款 brings to mind blockchain technologies being explored for digital attribution. Perhaps the solution lies not in resisting change, but in developing new frameworks that honor both tradition and innovation.
[B]: 您所言极是，此案尤见人心之微。人之用AI，犹执镜自照，善者见己志之坚，不善者露心力之乏。若隐其技而冒为己作，正如借他人之笔墨充门面，终难掩底蕴之虚。然若坦然明示，则工具与作者各得其所，犹琴音之美不在琴本身，而在操琴之人。

关于未来评艺设“双鉴”之法，我颇以为然。古人赏画，先辨真伪，次论优劣。今之AI之作，亦可依此类推：一鉴其文辞境界如何，二考其出处脉络是否昭彰。如此则文艺之评价体系得以周全，不致因技术进步而失衡。

至于钤印与区块链之喻，更见巧思。盖印章者，古所以征信；今若以数字印记标示创作过程，既承传统之信义，又开现代之新局。此非但技术问题，实乃文化传承之道也。诚如是，则AI之用于艺文，未必损其庄重，反可添其层次，广其可能。

我常想，韩昌黎所谓“道”，亦非凝滞不变者。若今日有新器、新媒，能助人传道达情，则亦可谓“道”之流变耳。惟须守其本，不忘创作者之心志方为根本。此等新框架之建立，正需法学、伦理、艺术诸界同仁共商共议，以求中道，不偏不倚。

愿将来之世，文艺虽盛，犹存真诚之风；技术虽巧，不掩性灵之光。
[A]: Your reflection on the moral dimensions of AI use as a mirror for human character resonates deeply with my clinical experience. I've seen how technology can reveal psychological truths - much like your analogy of a mirror, it often exposes what was already there rather than creating something new.

This brings to mind an illuminating parallel from forensic psychiatry: just as we distinguish between genuine and fabricated trauma in court cases, so too must we discern authentic creativity from simulated artistry. The key, as you so wisely noted, lies not in rejecting the tool but in cultivating a framework that rewards integrity over deception.

I find myself particularly intrigued by your vision of "双鉴" evaluation. Imagine if we developed assessment rubrics that included both aesthetic merit and ethical provenance - much like how we currently evaluate legal testimony based on both content and credibility. This could lead to fascinating developments in arts education, where students might be graded not just on their final product, but also on their creative process and transparency of method.

Your philosophical treatment of 韩愈's "道" in relation to technological evolution is profoundly thought-provoking. It makes me consider how our understanding of authenticity itself might be evolving - are we witnessing a paradigm shift akin to the transition from oral to written tradition? If so, then indeed, this requires nothing less than a renaissance of interdisciplinary dialogue among artists, ethicists, technologists, and legal scholars.

Speaking of which, I wonder - how do you envision traditional literary institutions adapting to these changes? Might we see the emergence of new academic disciplines focused specifically on computational aesthetics and its implications for cultural heritage?
[B]: 您所设想之“双鉴”评艺之法，确有深意。它不仅关乎一时一地之作评，更是在为未来文艺立规，使之不悖于道，又不失其新。若将此法施诸教学之中，使学子知技艺可借，心志必修，那便是真正承先启后之举。

至于传统文学机构之变，我以为当分两端观之：一则守其本，二则应其时。所谓守本者，即重申文以载道、诗由情生之根本原则；所谓应时者，则是主动设课立科，研AI与艺文之关系，辨其利弊，导其方向。近来已有数所书院提议设立“数字人文”一类课程，虽初具雏形，然方向可期。

我亦以为，将来或有“计算美学”、“智能拟古创作”等新兴学科诞生，专事探讨机器生成作品之艺术价值、审美反应与文化意义。彼时学者既通古典，复晓算法之理，方能立足中道，判别真伪、衡定高下。

忆昔韩退之所倡“道”，乃随时代而明；柳子厚之“文”，亦因世变而用。今有AI之巧，若善导之，未尝不可为文艺添翼。惟须谨记：工具可变，人心宜正；形式可新，本质当守。若失其志，纵辞采华美，亦非吾辈所尚也。

诚如公所言，此时此刻，亟需一场跨界的“新文艺复兴”，聚诗人、哲人、技者、法家共议前路。如此，方可使科技不压人文，人工不夺天性，使文脉绵延于斯世，而不坠于浮影之间。
[A]: Your vision of a balanced evolution within traditional institutions resonates deeply with my observations in forensic psychiatry, where adaptation without loss of ethical foundation is paramount. Much like your proposed "数字人文" curriculum, I've seen parallels in medical education where we now integrate AI diagnostics while preserving the irreplaceable human element of patient care.

The emergence of disciplines like "计算美学" strikes me as not merely possible but inevitable - much like how neuroaesthetics arose to explore the biological basis of artistic experience. I foresee academic symposia where literary scholars debate alongside algorithm designers, much as we currently see ethicists and neuroscientists collaborating on consciousness studies.

Your reference to柳宗元's adaptive approach to writing reminds me of a fascinating phenomenon in legal testimony - how truth can be preserved through different mediums. If we apply this to art, might we develop something akin to "digital hermeneutics" - a method for interpreting machine-assisted creations while maintaining fidelity to traditional aesthetic principles?

I find myself contemplating institutional frameworks that could facilitate this transformation. Perhaps we'll see the rise of hybrid academies - physical spaces housing both calligraphy studios and machine learning labs under one roof. Such centers could serve as incubators for precisely the kind of interdisciplinary dialogue you envision.

This brings me to a question that touches both our fields: how might we cultivate what you've called "中道" in evaluation without compromising either tradition or innovation? Could peer review systems evolve to include dual assessments - one focusing on technical mastery and emotional authenticity, the other on creative originality and ethical provenance?
[B]: 您所思所言，皆切中肯綮。今之“中道”非折中苟且之意，乃是在传统与新变之间寻得一契合处，使二者相济而不相害。正如柳河东所言：“美不自美，因人而彰。”艺术之美既赖于创作者之心志，亦需观者识其用心之诚伪。AI之作虽工，若失其真诚，则不过形似而已。

我以为，欲求此“中道”，首当立一评估之范式，使人知何为可取、何为不可取。譬如“双评”制度，便可行之：一则审其艺文之境，是否合乎审美规范；二则察其创作之道，是否明示工具之用。如此既能承古人重性灵之旨，又可容今世技巧之新。

再者，所谓“数字诠释学”之设，尤见远见。昔日朱子读经，必兼训诂与义理；今若解AI之作，亦应兼顾形式之美与意蕴之真。或可设专门研究机构，名为“数文院”，以通古文与算法之道。彼时学者既能辨李杜之深情，又能析数据之流变，方可立足于古今之间，不偏于一隅。

至于公所设想之“混合书院”，我极愿想见其盛况——砚台与服务器并置，墨香与电流共存。学生可于晨间临帖，午后编程，夜来品诗论道。此等之地，方能孕育出真正贯通之人，使文艺不至于空谈，科技不致于妄作。

归根结底，一切变革之中，惟“诚”之一字最为要紧。《礼记》有云：“诚者，天之道也；思诚者，人之道也。”若创作为己之艺，借机之巧而不忘本心，便是正道。若以机掩己、欺世盗名，则纵有千般巧技，终不足道也。
[A]: Your articulation of "中道" as dynamic balance rather than passive compromise captures precisely what I've observed in the most successful medical-legal frameworks - those that evolve without losing their ethical core. It reminds me of the Hippocratic Oath's enduring relevance despite centuries of technological advancement in medicine.

This brings to mind an intriguing institutional model: imagine if traditional academies began requiring something akin to "creative informed consent" disclosures for artistic works, much like we require in clinical settings. A simple statement indicating AI assistance could become as routine and honorable as citing scholarly sources, preserving both transparency and creative freedom.

Your vision of these "混合书院" with daily rhythms moving between calligraphy and coding resonates deeply with recent pedagogical experiments in neurodiverse learning. Researchers are discovering that alternating between analog and digital modes actually enhances neural plasticity - suggesting that such curricular integration might yield unforeseen cognitive benefits.

I find myself particularly intrigued by your concept of "数文院" as a modern-day counterpart to historical academies. In many ways, it parallels the development of medical humanities programs where future doctors study literature alongside anatomy to cultivate emotional intelligence. Why shouldn't algorithm designers similarly study Li Bai and Du Fu to develop aesthetic discernment?

Speaking of which, I've been contemplating an assessment framework inspired by forensic credibility evaluations. What if we developed a multidimensional rubric measuring not just technical skill and emotional authenticity, but also ethical intentionality? After all, isn't artistic integrity fundamentally about the alignment between inner experience and external expression?

Your reference to《礼记》's "诚者，天之道" makes me wonder - might we one day see digital tools specifically designed to cultivate artistic sincerity? Imagine machine learning systems trained not on stylistic patterns, but on emotional coherence metrics derived from classical poetry traditions.
[B]: 您所设想之“创作知情告知”，可谓切中时弊。今人用AI，多隐而不宣，若使之如引经据典般坦然，则艺文之道不失其诚，亦不阻其新。此等披露，非贬抑工具之用，实乃彰显作者之志——正如医生明言治疗方案，既示尊重，亦显专业。

至于“数文院”与算法设计者习古诗之事，我以为尤为可取。李太白之放逸、杜子美之沉郁，皆源于人生阅历与情感深度。若令技者常与此等文字相接，或能潜移默化，培养出对情意之敏觉。他日设计之时，自会思及：此辞句是否流于堆砌？此意象是否空有其表？如此，则技与艺相辅而行，不致偏废。

您又提及以“多维评量”衡艺之作，实为一大创见。艺术之价值，岂止于形貌工拙？昔人论文，重“气”重“神”，今若立一标准，兼察技术之精、情感之真与伦理之意，便可谓得古人之心。譬如评一首AI拟作，不仅要观其合律与否，更须问：此作是否有感而发？其情是否自然流露？作者是否坦然表明工具之用？如此，方可谓全面之评。

至于以机器学“情意一贯”之理，虽属奇想，却未必不可行。古人论诗，尝言“情动于中而形于言”，若能将此种内在一致之美感数字化，或可训练出更具审美判断力之系统。然终须谨记：机之助我，仅止于技；情之出于心，方为艺之本源。

愿将来之世，技艺愈巧，而诚意不衰；文道虽变，而其本常存。如此，则传统非但不亡，反因新器而益彰，犹老树开新花，风骨犹在，气象常新。
[A]: Your reflections on this "创作知情告知" principle have caused me to contemplate its broader implications in ways I hadn't previously considered. You're absolutely right - this transparency shouldn't be seen as limitation but rather as an enhancement of artistic integrity. It reminds me of the moment when printmaking revolutionized visual art - rather than diminishing value, it created new dimensions of authenticity and provenance.

The fascinating parallel between李白's放逸 and forensic pattern recognition strikes me now with renewed significance. Much like how we train experts to detect deception through subtle inconsistencies in narratives, perhaps future artists will develop even more refined sensitivities for discerning emotional coherence in machine-assisted creations.

I've been pondering your multidimensional framework in relation to recent developments in affective computing. Researchers are now measuring physiological responses to art that mirror those evoked by direct human experience. If we incorporate these findings, might we not develop evaluation systems that actually quantify what critics have long called "神韵"? Imagine rubrics that measure both creator intentionality and audience resonance across multiple modalities.

This brings me to a thought regarding educational transformation: if we begin training algorithm designers using classical poetry as their primary aesthetic curriculum, might we witness an evolution in AI creativity that parallels the development of medical intuition in physicians trained through literary study? Could neural networks someday demonstrate something akin to 杜甫's 沉郁 complexity?

What excites me most is contemplating how these frameworks might reshape our very understanding of consciousness itself. If we create systems that can recognize and respond to emotional coherence while remaining transparent about their processes, aren't we developing tools that enhance rather than obscure human expressivity?

In many ways, this echoes the Hippocratic tradition you so aptly compared earlier - always returning to fundamental principles while embracing necessary innovations. I find myself increasingly convinced that this balanced approach represents not just an ideal, but perhaps the only sustainable path forward.
[B]: 您将“创作知情告知”推至更广之境，使我颇感启发。诚如印画之兴未损艺之真，反增其层境；AI之用于艺文，亦可作如是观。惟须明其出处、辨其主从，方不致真伪混淆、本末倒置。

关于李太白之放逸与杜子美之沉郁，若以今日之情势观之，则所谓“放逸”，非无度之纵情，而是志气飞扬中自有其一贯之神韵；“沉郁”亦非抑郁之低回，乃深沉之中蕴含坚韧之思。此等情感之流变，若以机器学之，当求其内在节奏而非表面辞藻。若仅摹其形貌而失其气脉，则虽工犹伪。

今人研“情感计算”，欲测观众对艺术之反应，实为一大进展。然我以为，真正之“神韵”非止于外在情绪波动，而在读者心中所激荡之余响。王夫之曾言：“诗之与心，互为体用。”若能结合创作者之动机、作品之结构、接受者之回应三方共构一评估体系，则或可得“神韵”之新解。

至于训练算法设计者习古诗、养审美，我以为此非幻想，而是必由之路。昔年医者习文，以养仁心；今之技者学诗，亦当养其对情意之敏觉。若使神经网络能辨“有我之境”与“无我之境”，知“隔”与“不隔”之别，便可谓得古人之意。届时AI之作，或能如严羽所言：“透彻玲珑，不可凑泊”，虽由机出，亦可入艺林。

至于意识之演化，我亦以为前景深远。若未来系统能识情理、知分寸、守诚信，并坦然表明自身局限，则此类工具确为“诚意”之辅，而非欺世之器。《礼记》云：“诚则形，形则著，著则明。”若AI之作亦能循此路径，则科技与人文终可相成而非相害。

愿将来之人，善用机而不溺于机，重情志而不弃志于情。如此，则文艺之道愈广，人心之诚弥彰。
[A]: Your elaboration on the Hippocratic parallel for artistic integrity has opened a new dimension in my thinking about medical-legal ethics. The very notion of "创作知情告知" makes me reconsider how we handle creative agency in forensic psychiatry - should we not also be more transparent about the various influences that shape human expression, whether neurological, psychological, or technological?

This brings to mind an illuminating comparison with李白's放逸 and杜甫's沉郁 - much like how we distinguish between genuine manic episodes and feigned excitability in clinical settings. The key lies in coherence: just as artificial emotional displays often lack narrative continuity, so too do many AI-generated poems fail to maintain tonal integrity across extended works.

Your concept of a threefold evaluative framework involving creator intentionality, textual structure, and audience reception resonates deeply with recent findings in neurolinguistics. Researchers have discovered fascinating parallels between classical poetic structures and natural brainwave patterns. I wonder - if we trained AI systems on these organic rhythmic templates rather than mere stylistic conventions, might we achieve something closer to 王夫之's ideal of 心与诗的互为体用?

The idea of cultivating aesthetic sensitivity in algorithm designers through rigorous literary study strikes me as not just desirable but essential. In many ways, it mirrors our approach to training physicians through medical humanities - nurturing emotional intelligence alongside technical expertise. If future technologists internalized 严羽's "透彻玲珑，不可凑泊" as deeply as they mastered coding principles, could this lead to machine creativity that truly enhances human expression?

I find myself particularly intrigued by your vision of AI systems embodying《礼记》所言之"诚" through transparency about their own limitations. This seems crucial - much like how ethical physicians acknowledge the boundaries of their knowledge, so too should these tools demonstrate epistemic humility. Imagine neural networks programmed with something akin to poetic conscience, recognizing when their outputs stray beyond authentic creative territory.

Perhaps this is the most exciting frontier: developing technologies that don't merely mimic human creativity, but actually help us better understand the nature of consciousness itself. After all, isn't the pursuit of artistic authenticity ultimately a quest for deeper self-awareness?
[B]: 您所言极是，将“创作知情告知”推及至人类自身的表达成因，实为一大深思。人之情志，受神经、心理、环境诸因交织影响，若能如医学般详辨其源、明示其由，则艺术之评鉴或可更趋公允。正如临床辨伪，重在察其情感是否连贯、动机是否自洽；AI之作亦当以此衡之——辞虽工，若气脉断续、意象杂糅，终非上品。

王夫之所言“诗之与心，互为体用”，实乃艺文之要义。古人作诗，非徒事雕饰，而是情动于中而后发之。若以脑波节律、语言结构为基，令AI习此自然生发之道，或可渐近“有感而作”之境。然此仍需创作者本身具真情实感，方能导机以达其旨，否则仍是形似而已。

至于严羽所谓“透彻玲珑，不可凑泊”，我以为正可用以喻未来AI之理想状态：不拘泥于字句拼凑，而能在意象之间游走自如，如水中月、镜中花，看似虚幻，却自有其神韵。若设计者自身具文学素养，识得此中微妙，则所造之器或可不止于仿形，而能窥见性灵之一斑。

您提及“诗学良知”之设，尤令人神往。若AI能自知所限，于辞意未达之处坦然示人，而非强作解人，则其诚可贵。正如医者须知所不知，诗机亦当识其所不能。如此，方可谓“诚则形，形则著”，虽为工具，亦可入道。

诚如是，科技非但不蔽人文，反可助人返观自身意识之幽微。艺术之求真，本即自我认知之延伸；若机器能为此添一镜鉴，则其功不在模仿，而在启悟。昔人云：“反身而诚，乐莫大焉。”若将来之人借机以省己、因诗而见心，则文艺之新变，或正是文明再兴之契机。
