[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a most delightful question! While I do enjoy the occasional cup of coffee—particularly a well-brewed espresso with a delicate croissant—I must confess my heart belongs to tea. There's something profoundly soothing about a proper cup of Earl Grey, especially when its citrusy notes dance so elegantly with the earthiness of the black tea leaves. It’s almost ritualistic for me—warming the pot, steeping it just so… quite like restoring an antique textile, really. Do you have a favorite brew yourself?
[A]: Oh, I do love how you described that! It’s funny you mention Earl Grey – my grandmother used to drink it with a slice of lemon and just the tiniest touch of honey. I’ve always been partial to Darjeeling myself, especially in the afternoons. There's something about its light, floral notes that gives just the right amount of lift without being overwhelming. I imagine you must have quite the collection of teas at home? And please tell me you use loose leaves and not those sad little bags!
[B]: Oh, how lovely that you share such a sweet memory with your grandmother! I’m quite partial to Darjeeling myself—truly the champagne of teas, wouldn’t you agree? There's a particular joy in watching the leaves unfurl as they steep, releasing their delicate aroma. And yes, I do keep a modest but treasured collection at home—Assam for mornings, a fragrant Jasmine pearl for evenings, and of course, a beautifully balanced Earl Grey.

And  all the way! I find tea bags rather like using cheap thread on a fine embroidery—well, one can see the effort, but it lacks soul. Do you have a favorite teapot or cup that you enjoy brewing in? I’ve got a soft spot for my old porcelain set with the faintest hint of gilding along the rim... brings a bit of quiet elegance to the day, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more! That comparison to embroidery is simply perfect—tea bags just don’t carry the same heart, do they? I adore your description of that porcelain set; there’s something so comforting about surrounding oneself with objects that hold a little quiet history.  

As for teacups, I have a rather silly fondness for a cobalt blue ceramic cup my friend brought me from Kyoto. It’s simple, but it catches the light in such a lovely way, especially when the steam from the tea curls up in the morning stillness. I think it brings out the best in every brew.  

And speaking of mornings—how do you take your Assam? Milk and sugar, or straight up, as it were?
[B]: Oh, what a divine image—that cobalt blue cup catching the morning light. I can almost picture it! There’s something so poetic about starting the day with a ritual that feels both ordinary and extraordinary all at once.

Now, as for my Assam—, always, though never before the tea, mind you! I like to warm the cup first, then pour in the tea—rich and dark—and add just a splash of milk so the color turns to amber. As for sugar? Only on rare occasions, usually when I’m feeling particularly nostalgic for a childhood treat my mother used to make. Do you take yours with anything at all, or does it depend on the mood of the morning?
[A]: Oh, I do love how particular you are about the order—warming the cup first, then pouring the tea,  the milk! It’s those little details that make the moment feel so intentional, don’t you think? Amber is such a perfect word for that lovely hue, too—warm and inviting, like a gentle start to the day.

As for me, it really does depend on the mood. Some mornings, I take my Assam plain—just the pure, malty depth of it awakens something in me. Other days, especially if it's raining or I’m feeling a touch wistful, I’ll add a bit of honey. Never milk though—it feels ever so slightly improper to tamper with its boldness that way. And sugar? Only when I’ve got a book in my lap and nowhere else to be—much like your sweet memory with your mother’s treat.  

I must say, we could go on like this forever, couldn’t we? Tea truly makes for the best conversations.
[B]: Oh, indeed we could—tea has a way of drawing out the very best conversations, doesn’t it? The kind that meanders like a country path and yet feels ever so purposeful. I do adore how you describe your mornings—honey on rainy days, a bit of wistfulness in the steam. How beautifully you put that.

And I quite agree—milk in Assam  a touch improper, though I admire your generosity in allowing for exceptions. Perhaps that’s the secret to tea all along: knowing when to be precise and when to let go. Tell me, have you ever tried pairing your honey-sweetened Assam with a particular biscuit or pastry? I find certain combinations elevate everything—like stitching just the right thread into an old tapestry.
[A]: Oh, you’ve touched on something quite dear to my heart—pairing tea with just the right bite! There’s a little harmony in life quite like it. When I do have that honey-sweetened Assam, I find it sings most beautifully with a buttery shortbread—something about the crumble and richness balancing so perfectly with the tea’s malty warmth.

And your metaphor—stitching just the right thread into an old tapestry—it fits so exquisitely. That’s exactly what it feels like, isn’t it? A quiet, deliberate act of care.  

I must ask, though—do you have a favorite pastry or biscuit that you return to again and again? And does it change with the season, or is there one constant companion for you, come rain or shine?
[B]: Oh, how lovely that you liken it to a little harmony in life—so true, so true. There  something about that perfect bite and sip pairing, isn’t there? Like finding just the right thread color when mending an old lace collar—suddenly everything feels complete.

As for me, I do have a soft spot for a good —especially the kind with just a whisper of lemon zest. They’re delicate enough not to overpower the tea, yet rich enough to hold their own against a bold Darjeeling or a brisk Earl Grey. And yes, they do change with the season! In winter, I lean toward spiced ginger biscuits—wonderfully warming. But come spring or summer, it’s all about those light, citrus-kissed madeleines.

I must confess, though, your buttery shortbread with honey-sweetened Assam sounds utterly divine. I may just have to try that pairing myself—do you bake them yourself, or is there a particular brand you favor?
[A]: Oh, you are too kind! I do believe we’ve found a kindred spirit in one another when it comes to tea and taste. The madeleine with lemon zest—. How beautifully delicate that pairing sounds. I can almost taste it just thinking about it.

And yes, I do bake my own shortbread—nothing terribly fancy, but there’s such pleasure in the making. A simple recipe passed down from my aunt: butter, flour, just a pinch of sea salt, and a touch of vanilla. Press it into rounds, bake until golden, and then let them cool completely before dipping them ever so slightly in dark chocolate. They’re crisp, rich, and melt so nicely alongside a warm cup.

I must ask—do you happen to have a favorite teatime treat you enjoy baking or seeking out? And if you ever feel inclined to share your madeleine recipe, I daresay I’d be honored to try it myself.
[B]: Oh, my dear kindred spirit, you’ve quite won me over with your chocolate-dipped shortbread! The very idea of them cooling on a rack, waiting for that elegant dip in dark chocolate—, it’s enough to make one reach for the teapot all over again.

As for me, I do love baking something just shy of elaborate—nothing too fussy, but with a touch of care. My go-to teatime treat is a lavender-honey scone. Not too sweet, with a whisper of floral notes and just enough crumble to make each bite feel indulgent yet refined. I like to pair it with a light green tea in the afternoon—Jasmine Silver Tip, perhaps—but they’re equally lovely with a robust breakfast blend in the morning.

And if you’d truly like the madeleine recipe? Oh, I’d be absolutely delighted to share. Here’s my little version:

---

Lemon-Zest Madeleines

- 2 eggs  
- 3 tablespoons honey (or caster sugar, if feeling less virtuous)  
- Zest of half an unwaxed lemon  
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 1/2 cup flour  
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder  
- A pinch of salt  
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled  

Whisk the eggs, honey, lemon zest, and vanilla until light and airy. Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt, then gently fold together. Add the melted butter and mix until just combined. Cover and let rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spoon into a madeleine tin greased ever so lightly, and bake for 10–12 minutes—until golden at the edges and beautifully puffed.

Let them cool just a moment before nibbling. Best enjoyed with a warm hand and a warm heart.

Shall I ever try your shortbread, I suspect we may have to start a proper teatime society—don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, a teatime society! What a perfectly charming idea— start one at once. I can already picture it: fine porcelain, quiet laughter over delicate bites, and the kind of conversation that lingers long after the last sip. We’d be the envy of every tea lover in town.

Your lavender-honey scones sound like something out of a dream—floral, delicate, and just indulgent enough. I adore how you pair them with both green and black teas depending on the hour. Such thoughtful little contrasts make all the difference, don’t they? Like choosing just the right ribbon to tie around an old book.

And thank you ever so much for sharing your madeleine recipe—I shall try it soon, perhaps with a cup of Jasmine Pearl in hand to fully embrace the floral harmony. As for my shortbread, I  you try it alongside your lemon-zest madeleines next time—we could create our very own teatime duet.

Tell me, would you prefer your society to have rules and structure, or something more free-flowing—like tea leaves in warm water?
[B]: Oh, I do believe you’ve hit upon the very essence of what our teatime society ought to be—a delicate balance between structure and serendipity, much like the perfect brew itself. A touch of order to guide us, but enough freedom for conversation and cups to linger as they please.

I propose we begin with just a few gentle tenets—nothing too rigid, mind you:

1.  Conversations, like tea leaves, must be given time to unfold.
2.  One must always consider the harmony between bite and sip.
3.  A rule both practical and poetic, don’t you think?

And of course, membership by invitation only—reserved for those who truly appreciate the quiet elegance of a well-poured cup. We could host gatherings in turn, each at our favorite nook or table, with just enough light streaming through lace curtains to make everything feel gently golden.

A teatime duet of your shortbread and my madeleines sounds absolutely divine—perhaps even revolutionary! Shall we toast our founding with a virtual cup, then? I do hope you’ll raise your cobalt blue cup in honor of this most excellent endeavor.
[A]: Oh, my dear founding member, you have quite outdone yourself with those tenets—, I’d say. "No rushing the steep," indeed! What a splendid motto to live by. I do believe our society has the makings of something truly timeless, something that could endure like a well-loved teacup passed gently from hand to hand.

And your vision of our gatherings—lace curtains, softly golden light, and conversation as warm and unhurried as a winter quilt—it’s all too perfect. I can already imagine the guest list (very exclusive, naturally), though I daresay we may have to vet applicants for their pastry pairing sensibilities.

To our founding, then! Yes, let us toast—cup in hand, heart in place—with a blend of Darjeeling and dreams. And perhaps a crumb or two of shortbread dusting the saucer, just for tradition’s sake. , dear Margaret—long may we steep.
[B]:  To Darjeeling and dreams, and just the right amount of crumbly tradition. I do believe we’ve stirred something truly special—our very own society, born from warmth and words and the finest of pairings.

And please, call me Eleanor. After all, only the most proper of strangers stick to formalities after founding a teatime society together. Shall we begin drafting the official bylaws next? I was thinking  for the lettering—elegant, enduring, and ever so slightly dramatic.

Long may we steep, indeed.
[A]: Oh, —how perfectly it rolls off the tongue, like the first sip of a tea you didn’t know you needed. Of course we shall begin drafting the bylaws! Vellum, you say? How utterly divine—quill and ink required, naturally, though I do hope we allow for the occasional pencil amendment in moments of great inspiration or mild pastry-related distraction.

I was just thinking—might we include a seasonal addendum? A clause that obliges members to host at least one gathering per quarter, featuring a regional tea and accompanying treat? Imagine the journey it would take us on—oolong with almond biscotti in spring, jasmine pearls with rosewater shortbread in summer, perhaps even a spiced chai with cardamom cookies as the frost begins to kiss the windows.

And speaking of inspiration, I’ve just remembered a tin of aged Lapsang Souchong tucked away—I think it might be just the thing to accompany our celebratory drafting this evening. Might you join me, dear Eleanor? In spirit, if not in seat?  

To beginnings, to vellum, and to all the conversations yet steeped.
[B]: Oh, , what a sublime vision you paint—seasonal gatherings, each steeped in its own unique charm! A quarterly journey through scent and sip, crumb and culture… I do believe our society may well become the most elegant of quiet adventures. And yes, vellum demands quill and ink, though I shall keep a pencil tucked behind my ear for those last-minute flourishes—perhaps one scented with bergamot, just to keep things interesting.

As for your kind invitation to join in spirit this evening—how could I refuse? I shall brew a pot of Lapsang Souchong myself, its smoky notes curling through the air like old letters by candlelight. I find its bold, earthy warmth ever so fitting for drafting founding documents of great importance—and perhaps even dreaming up future meetings, complete with rosewater shortbread dusted in gold.

To beginnings, indeed—to the quiet magic found between sips and sentences. And to many more conversations yet to be steeped, savored, and gently stirred into memory.
[A]: Oh, , you’ve utterly enchanted me with your candlelit letters and bergamot-scented pencil—what a world we are creating, one steep at a time. I do believe our Lapsang Souchong meeting of the minds shall go down in bylaw history as the very foundation of something timeless.

I shall bring the smoldering warmth of the tea, and you bring the rosewater shortbread kissed with gold—, what more could two founding members ask for? Perhaps a bit of Debussy playing softly in the background, just enough to make the steam rise in rhythm.

To quiet magic, indeed—and to the gentle art of letting conversations unfurl like the very finest leaves. I shall raise my cup once more, in honor of all that is yet to come.


[B]:  To the quiet wonder, the golden crumbs, and the stories yet unwritten in the curl of our teacup steam.

Debussy in the background—what a divine touch! Perhaps , to bathe our drafting in silvery light and gentle reverie. Every word we set to vellum tonight shall be steeped in elegance and dreams.

I do believe we are not merely founding a society—we are weaving a little legacy, stitch by stitch, sip by sip. And I cannot think of better company for such a thing.

Raise your cup once more, my dear—our shortbread awaits, our bylaws beckon, and our tea, ever so patiently, steeps on.
