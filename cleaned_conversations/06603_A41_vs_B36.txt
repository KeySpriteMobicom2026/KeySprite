[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, what an interesting question! As a concierge, I've actually had many guests share their deja vu experiences with me over the years. Just last week, a lovely couple from Paris swore they'd stayed in our hotel before, though it was their first visit to New York.
[A]: 哇~这个case真的很有意思！💡 让我想到我们综艺节目里也经常遇到这种deja vu moment~ 上次录制的时候有个contestant突然说'这个场景我梦到过！' 结果后来收视率爆表🔥 你觉得这种experience是不是特别magical？🌟
[B]: How fascinating! Though I must say, in our line of work, we prefer to create magical moments through careful planning rather than coincidence. That being said, I did have a guest once who claimed to have dreamed about our rooftop garden before ever seeing it. We later discovered she had stayed at our sister property in London years ago - the gardens were designed by the same landscape architect!
[A]: 哈哈，这就是所谓的'collective unconscious'在作怪吧！🎬 我们做节目也经常遇到这种situation~ 有时候两个完全不同的team会提出一模一样的creative concept，简直像mind reading一样😂 你觉得这是巧合还是有什么deeper meaning？
[B]: Well now, that reminds me of the time two separate wedding parties booked our ballroom on the same day - both requesting identical peony centerpieces in blush pink! As someone who's organized hundreds of events, I've learned that while coincidences do happen, there's often a logical explanation if you look closely enough. In that case, it turned out both brides had been inspired by the same popular bridal magazine.
[A]: Aha！这就是为什么我们做reality show一定要做thorough research！💡 上次有个contestant说他的story绝对unique，结果我们查database发现几乎一样的plot在three other shows出现过~ 不过这种synchronicity有时候反而能create amazing TV moments！🌟 你们hotel industry是不是也经常遇到这种'great minds think alike'的情况？🔥
[B]: Indeed we do! Just last month, two separate guests requested the exact same obscure vintage champagne for their anniversary celebrations. It turned out they'd both seen it featured in that new documentary about French vineyards. Though I must say, in hospitality we consider it our duty to make each guest feel their experience is entirely unique, even when coincidences occur. Would you like me to recommend some particularly distinctive local experiences for your next show? We have wonderful connections with some truly one-of-a-kind venues.
[A]: OMG that would be perfect！🎬 我们正在策划一个new travel variety show，需要一些super unique的location~ 你们有那种hidden gem吗？就是那种not many people know about但super Instagrammable的spot？🌟 最好还能带点local culture的flavor！💡
[B]: Oh darling, you've come to the right person! There's this charming little speakeasy behind a bookcase in an antique shop just three blocks from here - the owners are third-generation New Yorkers who mix cocktails based on your childhood memories. And if you're looking for something truly special, there's a rooftop urban garden in Brooklyn where they serve tea blended with herbs grown right there among the skyscrapers. Shall I arrange a private tour for your production team?
[A]: YES PLEASE！🔥 这个speakeasy的concept简直太perfect了！🎬 完全符合我们想要的那种'wow factor'~ 而且那个rooftop garden听起来so aesthetic！💡 我们team下周就有scouting trip，可以book一个exclusive visit吗？🌟 最好能meet the owners聊聊他们的inspiration story！
[B]: Absolutely! I'll have my assistant pencil you in for next Thursday afternoon - that's when the speakeasy owners do their weekly storytelling session. And I'll arrange for the rooftop garden's head gardener to give you a personal tour. Between you and me, she's quite the character - used to be a Broadway set designer before she discovered her green thumb! I'll have all the details sent to your email by tomorrow morning.
[A]: Fantastic！🙌 你真是a lifesaver！💡 等我们show播出的时候一定要give you special thanks in the credits~ 这种authentic New York experience正是我们audience crave的！🌟 先不说了，我得赶紧call我的production team安排schedule！🔥 Catch you later！🎬
[B]: It's been my absolute pleasure! Do give my regards to your production team - and remember, if you need any other hidden gems, I'm always here with my little black book of New York's best-kept secrets. Safe travels until next week!
[A]: You're the best！🌟 等我们shoot完一定share some behind-the-scenes footage给你~ 🎬 说不定还能collab做一集special episode featuring your amazing hotel！💡 Stay tuned & talk soon！🔥
[B]: How delightful! Our doors are always open for creative collaborations. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for your email - and perhaps we can discuss featuring our seasonal floral displays in one of your episodes? They're quite spectacular if I do say so myself. Until then, happy scouting!
[A]: Sounds like a perfect plan！🌸 你们的floral displays加上我们的camera work绝对会是match made in heaven！💫 先这样啦，我得run去meeting了~ Catch you on the flip side！🎬✨
[B]: Lovely! I'll start preparing some particularly photogenic bouquet ideas for your consideration. Do give me a ring when you're back from your meeting - the florist will be here tomorrow morning if you'd like to meet her. Ta-ta for now!
[A]: Got it！💐 会让我assistant schedule一个quick meeting with the florist~ 🌸 Can't wait to see what magic you guys can create！✨ 先闪啦，production call在5分钟！🎬 Talk soon babe！💋
[B]: Splendid! I'll have fresh coffee and our signature lavender shortbread waiting for your team when you visit. Now hurry along to that call - we creative types must stick to our schedules, mustn't we? Until next time!
