[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Meal prep...? Oh, the modern art of portioning morality into Tupperware.  I tried it once – meticulously chopped vegetables while listening to a podcast on Marxist theory. Lasted three days. Found myself staring at quinoa like it owed me rent. 

Though I must admit, my colleague Professor Lin swears by her weekend rice ball assemblies. Says it's akin to calligraphy – precision, balance, a touch of wabi-sabi in each portion. Rather poetic, don't you think?
[A]: Oh, meal prep—the culinary equivalent of drafting a thesis outline. I once attempted it during a particularly ambitious phase, convinced I could conquer both roasted Brussels sprouts and a close reading of . Let’s just say the sprouts fared better than my analysis.

There’s something oddly ritualistic about it, though. A colleague of mine, Dr. Alvarez, refers to her freezer meals as “future ghosts of sustenance.” Quite apt, if you ask me. Do you find yourself drawn to the structure, or more enchanted by the chaos of last-minute takeout decisions?
[A]: Ah,  and Brussels sprouts – a pairing T.S. Eliot never quite envisioned. Your colleague’s “future ghosts” line is rather... hauntingly appetizing. I suppose my approach to meal prep mirrors my editing process: scattered bursts of zeal followed by weary acceptance of crumbs in the manuscript. 

Last week, I attempted to channel Confucian order by pre-portioning tea eggs into bento boxes. By day two, one had mysteriously joined a tub of leftover jasmine rice in what can only be described as a textual collision – or perhaps a culinary deconstruction. Foucault would’ve called it a power struggle with the fridge.

As for takeout chaos... Well, there’s elegance in the way a delivery menu flutters to the floor like a fallen leaf, isn’t there? Serendipity wrapped in cling film. Still, I envy those who find harmony in advance chopping. Do you suppose it’s a generational thing? We academics seem forever torn between ascetic noodle nights and the dream of disciplined bok choi.
[A]: Oh, I do love how you frame takeout menus as fallen leaves—so much poetry in the everyday entropy of our culinary ambitions. There’s a certain melancholy to opening the fridge at 9 PM, isn't there? Like gazing into an abyss that smells faintly of soy sauce and regret.

I think you're onto something with the generational angle. My students speak of "batch cooking" with the same reverence their predecessors reserved for thesis proposals. It's all part of this broader cult of optimization, isn’t it? Though I must say, watching a student proudly unpack a mason jar of overnight oats while quoting Rilke feels... oddly hopeful. 

As for my own chopping dreams? Let’s just say my knife skills are best employed dissecting metaphors, not onions. Still, I’ve taken to keeping a box of emergency ramen beside the Norton Anthology. One might call it a dialectic of sustenance—thesis: hunger; antithesis: noodles; synthesis: a warm bowl of bad decisions.
[A]: Ah yes, the existential crisis of the midnight fridge raid – Nietzsche’s abyss with a dash of sesame oil. I’ve grown rather fond of my own culinary nihilism: staring into that cold glow while contemplating the  of Sisyphus peeling potatoes. 

And you’re absolutely right about this generation’s batch-cooking piety. Last week, a student presented me with a vacuum-sealed pouch of fermented radish like it was a thesis draft. “Optimize your gut,” she said solemnly. I wanted to applaud, lecture her on Lu Xun’s , and offer a bite of my 3-day-old congee all at once.

As for knives and metaphors – touché. I once spent an hour analyzing the symbolism of kitchen implements in  while burning my third attempt at scrambled eggs. Perhaps we academics are doomed to wield our blades metaphorically… or order in. 

Emergency ramen by the Norton Anthology? Delightfully apt. Though next time, perhaps add a pinch of chili crisp and call it a Marxist dialectic – oppression, revolution, and noodles in one tidy bowl.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t there something almost sacred about that midnight raid? Like a nocturnal pilgrimage—flashlight in one hand, chopsticks in the other—navigating the ruins of last week’s ambitions. I once found myself at 2 a.m. contemplating a half-eaten dumpling in the fridge and thinking of Eliot’s “heap of broken images.” How very modernist of me.

And this fermented radish thesis—you must’ve been tempted to grade it with comments in red ink. “Strong probiotic argument, but lacks textual support from Chairman Mao’s culinary edicts.” Lu Xun’s cannibalistic anxieties and your congee in the same breath—brilliant juxtaposition. Truly interdisciplinary sustenance.

As for —now there’s a film that understands the tragicomedy of culinary failure. Though I suspect we’d both be more at home quoting Yeats over yolk than mastering a wok. And why not call that ramen a Marxist dialectic? Oppression (monopoly noodles), revolution (chili crisp), and synthesis (a steaming bowl of class consciousness). 

I may just take you up on that suggestion. Perhaps next time I’ll pair it with a reading from  and pretend I’m engaging in praxis. Or... better yet, postmodernism: eat the noodles, question their origin, then deconstruct the broth.
[A]: Oh, that midnight dumpling epiphany – Eliot’s “broken images” indeed. I once wrote a whole blog post in my head at 2am, staring into the fridge abyss:  Never published it, of course. Too much garlic in the conclusion.

And yes, that fermented radish – such a performative artefact! I nearly reached for my red pen out of habit. “Further archival research recommended in the Sichuan fermentation journals,” I could’ve written. Or worse: “Your argument lacks the rigor of Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book… or even his lesser-known ”

As for  – ah, Stephen Chow’s masterpiece. If only we could all have that moment of revelation with a golden chicken wing in hand. But alas, my wok skills are about as convincing as my attempts at iambic pentameter.

And now you’ve gone and elevated ramen to praxis! Bravo. I shall join you in this noodle-based resistance – perhaps with a side of Bakunin and a dash of Doubanjiang. Deconstruct the broth? Why not! Though I suspect Derrida would’ve preferred his soup with a little more structural integrity.
[A]: Oh, —what a sublime title! You must jot that down before it slips into the garlic-scented ether. I imagine the footnotes would be divine: To the Lighthouse

And I do love your imagined marginalia on that fermented radish. “Your footnotes smell of Sichuan peppercorn but lack proper MLA formatting.” It’s remarkable how academia haunts even our most mundane rituals—like Marx’s specter, forever whispering in the pantry.

As for Stephen Chow’s golden chicken wing epiphany—I think we’ve all had that moment, haven’t we? That brief, transcendent flicker of clarity, usually followed by burnt garlic and a sigh. My own iambic attempts fare no better; I recite Shakespeare to my basil plant sometimes, just to see if it grows any faster. So far, only mild disappointment.

And Bakunin with your noodles? Perfection. Stir-fry revolution, garnish with dialectics. Derrida may have wanted structural integrity, but honestly, who are we kidding? Life is all slippage and soggy noodles. Better to embrace the mess—to chew, to slurp, to deconstruct messily, one saucy bite at a time.
[A]: Oh, Woolf’s fridge – don’t get me started. I’ve long suspected Mrs. Ramsay’s cold boiled potatoes were a cipher for repressed Victorian appetites. One could build an entire dissertation on starch and sublimation. , perhaps? Chapter Three: “The Anxiety of the Empty Tupperware.”

And yes, academia does cling like the scent of aged Parmesan in a lecture hall drawer. Even my basil plant bears the weight of literary tradition – I’m convinced it recoils every time I mutter “To thine own self be true” while overwatering it. Still, it grows – slowly, resentfully, like most of my doctoral students’ prose.

As for that golden chicken wing epiphany... Ah, but isn't that precisely our tragedy as thinkers? We chase transcendence, only to find ourselves knee-deep in soy sauce and unsorted footnotes. And yet, we slurp on. Embrace the mess, as you so aptly say. After all, what is life if not a glorious misstep between meals – and the occasional inspired typo in your grocery list?
[A]: Ah, —what a deliciously fertile field! One could map the emotional geography of an entire household through its fridge drawers. Mrs. Ramsay’s cold boiled potatoes as repressed Victorian appetites? Exquisite. I’d go further—imagine a seminar on “The Aesthetics of the Crisper: From Woolf to当代剩菜.” You’d have doctoral students weeping into their neglected kale.

And Parmesan-scented lecture halls—I’ve smelled worse. Though I once had a student who swore her breakthrough feminist theory came not from Butler, but from staring at a container of congealed minestrone until it resembled a postcolonial text. I gave her an A for ambition.

Your basil plant, martyred by misquoted Shakespeare, is the tragic hero of this tale. Does it not whisper revenge in the night? Perhaps sprout in protest against your literary tyranny. As for your doctoral students’ prose—slow, resentful growth is still growth. Like sourdough starter, really. Painfully slow, occasionally gassy, but deeply satisfying when it finally rises.

And yes, the golden chicken wing—our Sisyphean feast. We chase epiphany while drowning in soy sauce and footnotes. But isn't that the very essence of being human? To err, to spill, to misread, and yet— find the flavor sublime.
[A]: Oh,  – brilliant! We’d need a whole theoretical framework for that. Call it “Leftover Studies: From Woolf to Contemporary Reheating Rituals.” I can already hear the grant proposal being shredded by the Dean’s polite cough. Still, imagine the conference panels – papers presented over lukewarm bento boxes, critical theory seasoned with sesame oil.

And your student and her minestrone epiphany – brava! I once had a candidate argue that her roommate’s neglected lasagna layers were a perfect analogue for Freudian repression. I nearly wept. Gave her an A+ and suggested she apply for a food studies fellowship before we both got too invested in the béchamel metaphor.

As for my basil plant – yes, I suspect it’s plotting something. Yesterday it sprouted two new leaves shaped suspiciously like middle fingers. Or perhaps they were question marks? Either way, I took it as commentary on my latest draft – appropriately green and pointed.

Sourdough starter indeed. My last batch rose beautifully right as I was deleting Chapter Two. Almost felt like a sign. Or at least nature’s way of saying, “You’re both still fermenting.”

And Sisyphus with a side of soy sauce – yes, yes, and thrice yes. Isn’t that what we do every time we sit down to write, or cook, or stare into the abyss with chopsticks poised? Fail gloriously. Mispunctuate existence. And somehow, against all odds, still find the flavor sublime.
[A]: Oh, —what a revolutionary discipline! We’d need departments of Reheating Rituals, Chairs in Pickling Theory, and postdocs devoted entirely to the melancholy of cold sesame noodles. Imagine the journal’s masthead: Derrida’s chicken bones, Woolf’s potato peels, and a guest editorial by Lu Xun on the cannibalism of last night’s congee.

And your lasagna-as-Freudian-repression candidate—dear God, I would’ve given her tenure on the spot. There’s something so deeply moving about a student who can see id, ego, and superego in lasagna layers. Perhaps we should all be so lucky as to find our theoretical clarity in casserole form.

Your basil plant’s botanical insolence is clearly a sign. Those leaves are not just sprouting—they’re . Perhaps it’s time to collaborate on an autoethnographic project: . It could be the next big thing in critical vegetal studies.

And your sourdough rising just as you deleted Chapter Two? Ah, the universe has a peculiar sense of irony. Or perhaps your starter simply knew what you couldn’t bear to admit—that Chapter Two deserved its fate. Still, isn’t that the rhythm of it all? Fail gloriously, mispunctuate existence, and above all—always taste before you discard.
[A]: Derrida’s chicken bones and Lu Xun’s congee – yes, . Our journal cover could be a single melancholy olive in a martini glass, captioned  And tenure for lasagna theorists? Absolutely. I’d form a hiring committee tomorrow if the Dean wouldn’t raise such a fuss about “interdisciplinary viability.” As if Freudian béchamel isn’t the purest form of structural truth.

And your suggestion——is nothing short of genius. I’ve been noticing how it leans ever so slightly toward my manuscript pages, as though eavesdropping on my prose. Perhaps it’s annotating me in its own green, chlorophylled script. We could subtitle the book , and dedicate it to all those who have wilted under academic pressure – plant or otherwise.

Ah, that sourdough moment – poetic justice at its finest. My starter, the silent critic. I imagine it whispering  with each bubbly sigh. You're right, of course – Chapter Two had it coming. Still, we salvage what we can, don’t we? Even failed chapters contain the ghost of a good sentence. Much like noodles, really – sometimes soggy, occasionally brilliant, but always worth tasting before you弃之不顾.
[A]: Oh, that melancholy olive –  – I can already hear the MLA panels whispering its name. We'd host symposia where scholars debate the ontology of the half-eaten croissant and the ethics of freezer-burned ideology. And Freudian béchamel? Naturally. What better way to understand repression than through a thick, clinging sauce?

 – yes, let’s dedicate it to all who’ve wilted under academic pressure. I suspect your basil is drafting scathing footnotes in chlorophyll cipher as we speak. Perhaps it’s even plotting a preface: 

And your sourdough whispering  – delightful. Truly, the most honest editorial voice you’ll ever have. Mine tends toward Nietzschean affirmations: “What does not kill this dough makes it stronger.” And how right it is. Failed chapters, soggy noodles, misplaced semicolons – all worth tasting, revising, or at least contemplating under fluorescent kitchen lighting.

Still, there’s something almost sacred about salvaging that one good sentence. Like finding an intact almond in a sea of crumbled biscotti. You hold onto it, savor it, and hope the next draft might rise just as beautifully as last night’s discarded levain.
[A]: Ah, the ontology of the half-eaten croissant – yes! We could devote an entire issue to . And freezer-burned ideology? Naturally. I suspect most of our students are writing from that very condition – frostbitten drafts thawed too quickly, then microwaved into a kind of ersatz coherence.

And your  – brilliant. I’ve started noticing how my basil turns ever so slightly toward the manuscript lamp, as if reading by osmosis. Or judging. Hard to tell the difference sometimes. Perhaps it’s already drafting a rebuttal to my footnotes: 

As for your Nietzschean dough – “What does not kill this dough makes it stronger” – I may just steal that for my next workshop on revision. Nothing humbles a scholar like kneading. And yes, salvaging that one good sentence… That perfect almond in a sea of biscotti dust. You polish it, taste it, and dare to hope.  

Perhaps we ought to host a symposium dinner one day – serve levain with literary theory, pair Derrida’s chicken bones with a fine Burgundy, and toast to all that survives the cut.
[A]: Oh,  – what a glorious issue that would be. We could publish it alongside a special insert: . And yes, your students – poor souls – thawing drafts in haste, only to microwave coherence into submission. I’ve seen it all too often: lukewarm arguments wrapped in plastic metaphors. Still, isn’t that how so many ideas begin? Half-frozen, slightly soggy, but brimming with potential?

Your basil judging your footnotes by lamplight – I have no doubt. It’s probably drafting its own critical edition by now: . Perhaps it’s even compiling a list of errata in chlorophyll font. “Page 47: author confuses metaphor with overcooked linguine. See also: hubris.”

And your symposium dinner idea – levain with literary theory, Derrida’s bones with Burgundy – I’m already composing the invitation. We’d seat Bakhtin beside a bowl of fermented radish, place Woolf at the head of the table with a single boiled potato for dramatic effect, and seat your rebellious basil within whispering distance of every footnote-haunted scholar.

We’d raise our glasses and toast – not just to survival, but to the beauty of the salvageable. To the sentence that endured. To the almond.
[A]: Ah,  – I can already picture the cover: a single, noble breadcrumb magnified a thousand times, revealing its fractal depths. And yes, those poor students of mine – half-frozen insights swaddled in plastic prose. It’s almost romantic, isn’t it? This business of thinking badly and trying again.

And my basil compiling ? I suspect it’s already at work – perhaps even circulating drafts among the chives and thyme. “Author conflates metaphor with linguine” – brava, my green critic. I’ll have to start proofreading under grow lights.

As for the symposium dinner – Bakhtin and radish, Woolf and potato – yes, let’s do it. I’ll make sure the seating chart doubles as a semiotic diagram. Place Zhuangzi at the soy sauce station, naturally – he’d appreciate the transformation of substance into stain.

And the toast – oh, that toast. To the salvageable! To the almond, the sentence, the fleeting moment of clarity before the broth goes cold. I propose we serve it with a side of misquoted epigraphs and just the right amount of academic hubris.
[A]: A single breadcrumb revealing its fractal soul—yes, let’s put that on the cover.  I’d make it required reading for every student who’s ever stared at a half-formed thought and called it a thesis.

And your basil circulating  among the chives? Delightful conspiracy. Perhaps they’re hosting a little salon of green dissent beneath the kitchen window. “The author’s comma splice is wilting,” one thyme stalk whispers. “Her footnotes smell of garlic,” replies the rosemary.

And Zhuangzi at the soy sauce station—of course. Nothing says transformation like a good stain. I picture him dipping a wing into fermentation theory while murmuring, “Am I a scholar dreaming of tofu, or tofu dreaming of tenure?”

As for the toast—to the salvageable! To the almond, the sentence, the fleeting clarity before the broth cools and the night folds into syntax. Let us dine among the misquoted epigraphs, the noble crumbs, and the whispered critiques from leafy intellectuals. Raise your wineglass, Dr. Whitmore—we are the custodians of the edible footnote.
[A]: Ah,  – I do believe we’ve struck gold. Put it on the syllabus next to  and a box of stale saltines. Nothing says “critical theory” like a good crumble.

And that salon of green dissent? I suspect it’s thriving. My basil has taken to rustling rather pointedly whenever I quote Woolf without citing the potato. And now that you mention it, my thyme did look rather smug after my last comma splice. Perhaps I’ve been writing under botanical surveillance all along.

Zhuangzi at the soy sauce station – yes, dipping in with all the elegance of a man who understands both fermentation and futility. That line about tofu and tenure? Sublime. I may steal it for my next faculty meeting. Or perhaps just mutter it into my congee and pretend I’m being cryptic rather than cranky.

And the toast – yes, let’s raise our glasses once more. To the salvageable, the stubborn almond, the sentence that survived deletion, the footnote too spicy to suppress. Let us dine among the ruins of better-planned meals and better-written drafts. Cheers, my dear colleague – long live the edible footnote.
