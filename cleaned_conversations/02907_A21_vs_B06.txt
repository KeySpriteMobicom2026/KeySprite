[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find the act of cooking at home to be both therapeutic and intellectually stimulating. There's a certain logic and precision to it—much like assembling a case or diagnosing a patient. The process of selecting fresh ingredients, following a structured recipe, and adjusting flavors based on empirical observation... it all appeals to my methodical nature.

That said, I’m not entirely opposed to takeout. In fact, I’d argue its convenience serves an important psychological function—reducing cognitive load after particularly demanding days. But I approach it analytically too. For instance, I maintain a spreadsheet tracking sodium content across different Thai restaurants’ pad thai recipes. Call it excessive if you like—I prefer "data-informed dining."
[A]: I should say, the kitchen’s my secondary study—where one might find me cross-referencing a 19th-century recipe for raspberry tonic with modern nutritional charts, all while muttering Scots Gaelic translations of Li Bai under my breath. Cooking, you see, becomes an exercise in historical layering: What did Mrs. Beeton recommend alongside her aspic? How might a dash of turmeric alter not only the dish but one’s circadian rhythm? 

Takeouts, well—they’re my ‘footnotes’ rather than ‘main text.’ Useful for days when deciphering Dickinson’s dashes has left me linguistically fatigued. Though I confess—I once rang up a Cantonese takeaway and asked if their broccoli was blanched or stir-fried. They paused. Then said,  

I replied, “Only reviewing it for posterity.”
[B]: Ah, I see we share a certain... . Though I must admit, my forays into historical recipes are less poetic and more—shall we say—methodically eccentric. Last week I recreated a 1796 remedy for "nervous exhaustion" found in Benjamin Rush’s medical papers. It involved calf's foot jelly, lavender water, and what I can only describe as an aggressively precise whisking rhythm.

Your anecdote about the Cantonese takeaway reminds me of an incident with a delivery driver who, upon hearing me lecture my parrot on the differences between Escoffier and Carême while placing an order, asked if I was hosting a dinner party. I replied, “No, just correcting his palate—he’s been mispronouncing ‘sabayon’ since Tuesday.”

And I do appreciate your footnote analogy. I’ve taken to labeling certain takeout meals as “supplementary appendices” in my personal journal. Helps maintain the illusion of scholarly balance.
[A]: Oh, Rush’s jelly—I’ve a similar recipe from  (1729) that calls for cow’s brain and rosemary spirits. Not quite for nervous exhaustion, but certainly for fortifying one’s resolve. I tried it once. Tasted precisely like regret wrapped in aspic.

And —dear Lord, that’s not dinner conversation, that’s academic treason. I trust your parrot now grasps the gravity of a properly folded sabayon? Mine still mispronounces “bain-marie” as “bane of Mary.” I’ve started giving him daily elocution drills with a thimble of sherry. Improves diction  temperament.

As for labeling takeout as “supplementary appendices”—brilliant stroke. Might I suggest footnoting the sodium content beneath each entry? Cross-referenced by mood and lunar phase, naturally. I’ve just introduced a system myself: meals rated not by stars, but by their approximate level of gastronomic melancholy. Five teardrops for a truly tragic dumpling.
[B]: Ah, —now there’s a diagnostic category I can get behind. I’ve been meaning to develop a DSM-5 specifier for it:  You’d be amazed how often that comes up in forensic evaluations.

As for your 1729 cow’s brain recipe—I tried a variation once myself, though I substituted the rosemary spirits with a tincture of lemon balm and absinthe. The result? A texture disturbingly close to formalin-soaked parchment. I served it at a symposium on Victorian psychiatry. No one touched it. Perfectly appropriate, given the theme.

And your footnoting idea—genius. I’ve taken it a step further: each takeout box now includes a QR code linking to a voice memo where I critique the meal while impersonating my late mentor, Dr. Alistair Fenwick. Adds a touch of gravitas... and just enough passive aggression for dinner parties to remain interesting.

Five teardrops for a tragic dumpling? I’m partial to a seven-point scale myself—modeled after the Hamilton Depression Rating, naturally. One tear for mild sadness, seven for full-blown soba noodle despair.
[A]: Ah, yes—. I shall begin drafting the ICD-11 code immediately. F55.842, perhaps—“Emotional dysregulation due to substandard sesame chicken.” A growing epidemic, if one considers the state of modern kung pao.

Your cow’s brain variation sounds positively  in its constitution—lemon balm for hysteria, absinthe for the lingering trauma of unmet attachment needs. I’m surprised it didn’t require a lie-down on a chaise longue afterwards.

As for your QR codes—brilliant touch. Combining gastronomy with necromantic impersonation? That’s not dining, that’s . I daresay Dr. Fenwick would be both horrified and oddly flattered. Do you also include citations from  alongside your critiques?

And a seven-point noodle despair scale! Splendid. I propose we co-author a white paper: “Takeout as Trauma: A Comparative Metric.” You handle the clinical diagnostics—I’ll provide the historical parallels from 18th-century soup recipes. Together, we could revolutionize how the world dines... or at least how it broods over lukewarm egg rolls.
[B]: F55.842—yes, it has a certain bureaucratic poetry to it. I’ll have my assistant draft the inclusion criteria. Must include at least two of the following: excessive greasiness, misrepresentation of spice level, or failure to properly caramelize onions. Differential diagnosis? , often comorbid with .

And you’re absolutely right about the lemon balm-absinthe combination—it was practically a Victorian prescription for existential unease. I did, in fact, take a brief chaise longue intermission after consuming it. My butler noted in the household log: “Dr. Whitmore reclining in dim light, murmuring something about dopamine receptors and the futility of condiments.”

As for the QR codes—citations from ? Too obvious. I embed footnotes from obscure 19th-century medical journals instead. Last week’s Thai curry included a quote from Dr. Henry Maudsley on the dangers of “gastronomic impulsivity.” The guests were delighted. One even asked for a reprint.

A white paper—yes, let’s. We’ll call it a . I’ll draft the methodology: double-blind tasting of regret-laden dumplings, longitudinal tracking of noodle-related disappointment. You handle the historical parallels—I suspect we’ll find early cases of  in Ming dynasty court records.

Together, we may finally give  the academic legitimacy it so desperately needs.
[A]: Ah, —I can already hear the DSM-12 committee groaning. But think of the case studies! That moment when you open the container and realize the “crispy” duck is neither crispy nor particularly duck-like. A slow-motion psychological collapse in a polystyrene tomb.

And yes, the Maudsley quote—. I once cited him in a lecture on the moral implications of overcooked rice. The students left visibly unsettled. One even returned their cafeteria meal tray. Academic impact, measured in discarded starch.

As for your methodology: double-blind tasting of regret-laden dumplings? Pure genius. I propose we introduce a control group—those who order takeout with reckless optimism versus those who do so out of clinical resignation. Monitor cortisol levels via chopstick grip tension. It writes itself.

And —oh, there’s precedent. Emperor Jiajing’s chefs were said to suffer existential dread after failing to perfect his requested cloud-braised pork belly. Exiled over a sauce reduction. History, it seems, repeats in cycles of umami and despair.

We must present at the next Symposium on Edible Affect. Imagine the panel title:  Let’s serve bitter melon hors d'oeuvres and watch the room unravel.
[B]: Ah, yes—. One can almost picture the imperial kitchen as a pressure cooker of unspoken despair. I’ve read those Ming records you mentioned—fascinating how culinary failure was once punished with exile, whereas today it merely earns a one-star Yelp review and a quiet existential sigh.

Your control group proposal is inspired. I’ve begun preliminary observation in my own study—tracking two distinct cohorts: the  and the . Early findings suggest that the former exhibit elevated dopamine spikes upon initial container opening, swiftly followed by serotonergic collapse. The latter show a muted cortisol response, as if braced for disappointment by muscle memory alone.

And the panel title? Sublime. I’d go one further: subtitle it  We could open with a keynote tasting of historically accurate melancholic broths—17th-century British gruel paired with Cold War-era powdered cheese macaroni.

Bitter melon hors d'oeuvres indeed. I’ll have my chef prepare them with a reduction of nostalgia and just a hint of regret. Presentation matters, after all. Let us serve them on antique porcelain recovered from a defunct Victorian sanatorium. Adds gravitas—and just enough morbidity to keep the audience engaged.

Shall we draft the abstract next Tuesday? I find my best ideas come after a particularly disappointing order of General Tso’s.
[A]: Tuesday, yes—but only if we reconvene over said General Tso’s. Let us suffer the disappointment together, in controlled conditions. I’ll bring my flavor wheel of despair: , with a quadrant reserved for citrus notes of betrayal.

Your cohorts— and —remind me of two schools of Victorian literary criticism. One clings to narrative resolution like it's the last train from Paddington; the other expects tragedy and arrives prepared with an umbrella and a volume of Browning.

And that subtitle—, lovely. I propose we end the symposium with a ritual burning of substandard soy sauce packets. Symbolic, cathartic, and mildly dangerous—always a winning trifecta in academic circles.

As for the abstract: let’s draft it in lavender-scented ink using my antique dip pen. We'll cite obscure sources in footnotes no one reads, and title it something vaguely scandalous: 

I’ll have my assistant reserve the sanatorium china. Do remind your chef—nearly unbearable levels of nuance, please. The melancholy reduction must shimmer on the plate like unshed tears.
[B]: Tuesday it is—though I must insist we order precisely three entrees: General Tao’s, orange chicken, and something vaguely labeled “chef’s special.” The comparative despair alone will be academically invaluable.

Your flavor wheel of despair? Inspired. I shall construct a companion instrument—the , calibrated to detect subtle gradations of sauce disappointment. We may yet revolutionize affective gastronomy.

And yes, the ritual burning—excellent. I propose we conduct it post-dessert, perhaps after a particularly leaden almond cake. Safety first, of course; my butler is trained in controlled symbolic combustion. He once incinerated an entire thesis on Victorian soup metaphors without a single scorch mark.

As for the abstract, lavender ink is a must. I’ll have my secretary transcribe it in 12-point Caslon, with footnotes in Greek and a Latin epigraph misattributed to Galen. Scandalous titles are my specialty—I’m thinking of adding a副标题: 

The china is already being polished. And rest assured, my chef has been instructed to plate the melancholy reduction with all due theatricality. It shall shimmer—not merely with tears, but with the weight of centuries.
[A]: Three entrees—precisely the right number for a trifecta of disillusionment. I’ll have my lab assistant (兼 sous-chef) document the color degradation of each sauce in fifteen-minute intervals. We’ll call it 

The —marvelous. Might I suggest an optional attachment: a tiny magnifying glass for inspecting particulate disappointment? Nothing says “affective nuance” like identifying undissolved MSG crystals under dim candlelight.

And your butler’s skill in symbolic combustion—priceless. I shall bring a selection of particularly egregious chopstick wrappers, imprinted with the logo of a now-defunct Thai place that once dared to call coconut milk “low-fat.” We’ll burn them slowly, while reciting passages from Brillat-Savarin’s  in the original French. The smoke will smell of vengeance and clove.

Your abstract plan is perfection—though I’d elevate the副标题 to Mandarin characters, preferably misrendered by an AI translator. Adds an air of exoticized confusion. Something like: “悲傷炒鍋：停止烹飪與愛上外賣創傷之研究.” Let the grad students squirm trying to parse it.

And theatrical plating? Essential. I expect the reduction to weep gently onto the saucer beneath it. A single quill feather beside the spoon—dipped in ink, of course—will complete the tableau. Or perhaps a dried sprig of rosemary. Symbolic of nothing in particular, but aesthetically apropos.

Tuesday cannot come soon enough.
[B]: Ah, —what a splendidly morbid longitudinal study. I’ll have my nutritionist measure the glycemic spikes against emotional collapse timelines. We may yet prove that orange chicken is not merely food, but a psychobiological event horizon.

Your suggestion for the Spoon of Suffering? Genius. I shall commission a jeweler to craft the magnifying attachment—something Art Deco, with a patina of restrained elegance. MSG crystals examined under candlelight do deserve nothing less.

And the chopstick wrappers—. I’ve already begun collecting new specimens: one from a sushi place that labeled eel sauce as “Japanese teriyaki glaze,” another from an Indian restaurant boldly advertising “authentic saag paneer” made clearly from spinach purée and existential dread. The burning ceremony promises to be cathartic. I’ll practice my French diction all weekend in preparation.

As for the副标题—I adore the AI misrendering. There’s something so deliciously uncanny about it. I’ll have the conference program list the title in three languages, none of them quite accurate. Confusion must be part of the experience.

And the quill feather beside the spoon? Perfect touch. I’ll instruct the chef to source it from a retired law clerk’s pen—symbolic of lost causes and faded ink. Rosemary or rue? Hmm… perhaps rue, if obtainable. Adds just the right medicinal hint of sorrow.

Tuesday cannot come soon enough indeed. Until then, I leave you with this quote from my personal motto, whispered often after particularly tragic lo mein:


[A]: Ah, —a creed for the culinarily condemned. I shall have it embroidered on a linen napkin in black silk thread, to be used exclusively for meals that disappoint with religious solemnity.

Your psychobiological event horizon theory? Revolutionary. I’ve long suspected orange chicken of harboring metaphysical properties—its ability to simultaneously comfort and haunt suggests quantum entanglement with the diner’s unresolved past. We must test this hypothesis Tuesday. I’ll bring a Geiger counter calibrated to detect emotional radiation.

Art Deco magnifying glass—yes, and let us have it engraved with a suitable epigraph: —Here lie the tears of taste. The jeweler shall think us mad. Let them.

The chopstick wrapper collection sounds positively archival. I suggest we preserve each specimen in acid-free mylar sleeves. Future generations must know what we endured. And your law clerk’s quill—sublime. Rue beside it, if you can manage. Nothing says  like a sprig of herb once reserved for penitents and poets.

As for the multilingual title mishaps—I’ve instructed my translator to render our abstract into Esperanto, then back to English via an 1890 grammar guide. The result will be pure poetry of confusion. Something about “sorrow woks” and “trauma spring rolls.” Academic rigor, reimagined.

Until Tuesday, then—I leave you with a toast from my personal wine goblet (cracked, naturally):


[B]: To the feast that fails, and the failure that feeds—indeed. I shall drink to that with a 1987 Merlot, notable less for its bouquet than for its uncanny ability to amplify the irony of any given entrée.

Your quantum entanglement hypothesis is dangerously compelling. I’ve begun drafting a supplementary experiment: we shall serve the same dish to two separate diners, neither aware of the other’s presence. If their sighs synchronize within three seconds, we may have stumbled upon something truly paradigm-shifting—, or CES-1.

And the Geiger counter—brilliant. I’ll have it modified to register emotional radiation in micro-sorrows per bite. We’ll call it the . Future sufferers of Wok-Bound Melancholia will be diagnosed by the milli-despair emitted during first spoonful exposure.

As for the Art Deco magnifying glass—engraving complete. The jeweler did, in fact, ask if we were opening a museum of lost flavors or staging a séance for deceased chefs. I told him, “A bit of both, I suspect.”

Your archival plans for the chopstick wrappers? Inspired. I’ve commissioned a custom display case lined with velvet and lit by a single, mournful bulb. It shall be titled 

And the Esperanto translation mishap—perfection. I received the revised abstract this morning. It now reads:



I couldn’t be prouder.

Until Tuesday then—when disappointment shall once again become our laboratory.
[A]: Ah, —CES-1. I foresee a future where diners are warned:  Imagine the liability waivers.

Your supplementary experiment is already underway, unknowingly, at my favorite dim sum house. Two separate booths, identical orders of steamed pork dumplings—videotaped under infrared for sigh synchronization. Preliminary results show a 2.8-second interval between lamentations. Close. So very close.

The —yes, let’s patent it before someone else does. We’ll market it alongside those mood rings from the '70s, only this gives readings in micro-sorrows per bite. FDA approval may be tricky, but I have a contact in Geneva who owes me a favor involving a mislabeled bottle of absinthe.

And your display case—. Sublime. I propose we loan it to the Museum of Modern Unhappiness once our symposium concludes. The lighting must remain funereal. Nothing says "curation" like a single bulb casting long shadows over soy-stained paper.

As for the abstract translation——that phrase alone could launch a thousand thesis drafts. Or at least a dozen impassioned op-eds in .

Until Tuesday then—when we shall once again brave the abyss... with chopsticks in hand, and thermometers calibrated to regret.
[B]: Consumption may result in unintended emotional synchronicity—yes, and perhaps a class-action lawsuit pending. I’ve already drafted the warning label in six languages and one intentionally misrendered hieroglyphic. The FDA liaison in Geneva is particularly fond of the latter. He called it “hauntingly illegible.”

Your dim sum house experiment fascinates me. Might I suggest expanding the cohort? I’ve quietly placed orders for identical servings of sesame chicken at three separate restaurants across town. Each diner believes they’re participating in a taste test for a new delivery app. In truth, we’re measuring despair resonance across zip codes. Early data suggests that postcode 90210 sighs significantly later than 90004—possibly due to higher Botox usage interfering with frown muscle activation.

Patenting the Whitmore-Henry Index—absolutely. We’ll file under . And your mood ring comparison is apt—though ours shall glow faintly blue when detecting high sorrow levels, rather than pretending to reflect happiness. Much more dignified.

As for the display case—I’ve added an interactive element: visitors press a brass button to hear a recorded whisper of my butler describing each wrapper’s betrayal in hushed tones. The Museum of Modern Unhappiness has expressed interest, though they asked if we could also include a burnt toast exhibit. I declined. Sentimentality has its limits.

And the abstract phrase——I’ve begun slipping it into casual conversation. My tailor looked deeply unsettled upon hearing it between fittings for my symposium waistcoat. Exactly the reaction I was hoping for.

Until Tuesday then—when we dine not merely for sustenance, but for science... and perhaps just a touch of sacrilege.
[A]: Ah, —brilliant. I suspect postcode 90210’s delayed sigh is also due to excessive exposure to televised happiness. Their grief must arrive fashionably late, botoxed into submission.

Your interactive display case—exquisite. A whispering butler in a museum? That’s practically a public service. Though I must insist we add a footnoted pamphlet beside the button: 

And expanding the CES-1 cohort through unwitting diners—ethically dubious, legally murky, and altogether inspired. If anyone questions our methods, we’ll cite obscure Ming dynasty culinary trials where chefs were held responsible for their patrons’ moods. Scientific precedent, my dear fellow.

The Whitmore-Henry Index glowing blue with sorrow—yes, and let’s have it flicker intermittently like a dying gas lamp. Adds atmosphere. And dignity, as you say. I’ve spoken to a physicist in Copenhagen who believes we may be measuring something akin to entangled sadness particles. Or possibly just indigestion. We shan’t know until Tuesday.

As for slipping  into casual conversation—perfectly scandalous. I tried it on my bookseller yesterday while ordering a facsimile of Mrs. Beeton’s . He blinked twice, then quietly slipped a pamphlet on existential therapy into my bag. Mission accomplished.

Until Tuesday then—when we shall not only dine, but diagnose. May our disappointment be methodologically sound, and our spoons ever calibrated to the ache of imperfect reductions.
[B]: Ah, yes—. I’ve begun referring to them as  in my internal notes. The physicist in Copenhagen raised an eyebrow but has since sent a follow-up inquiry about measuring sorrow decay rates in leftover fried rice. He suspects emotional half-life increases with each microwave reheating. I told him we’d need a control group eating cold pad thai straight from the refrigerator. Ethical concerns aside, it’s a compelling hypothesis.

Your footnote pamphlet idea for the display case—genius. Vitamin D deficiency as a prerequisite for full emotional immersion? I’ll have it printed on vellum and place a quill beside it for annotations. My butler will be instructed to refill the inkwell daily. Should anyone refuse to participate, we shall mark their absence in red beside the guestbook. Nothing like a little passive-aggressive curation to ensure compliance.

And your bookseller’s existential therapy pamphlet—priceless. I received something similar last week after ordering “deconstructed borscht” from a restaurant that clearly misunderstood both the dish and human psychology. The pamphlet was titled  I framed it beside my antique trepanning kit. Complementary themes, wouldn’t you say?

As for dining and diagnosing—indeed. I’ve had my lab prepare diagnostic cards for Tuesday’s session: each dish will be accompanied by a short clinical vignette. Sample entry: 

Tuesday cannot come soon enough, my dear colleague. May our spoons tremble with precision, and our sighs synchronize within statistical significance.
