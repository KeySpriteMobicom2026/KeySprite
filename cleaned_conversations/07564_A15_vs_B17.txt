[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question indeed. It reminds me of the way T.S. Eliot once described the intersection of past and future - a simultaneity of old and new. In much the same way, lab-grown meat represents both a continuation and disruption of our culinary traditions.

While I can't help but recall Wordsworth's reverence for nature when considering this technology, I must admit the potential benefits are rather compelling. The ethical implications alone - no slaughter, reduced environmental impact - seem to echo Thoreau's call for deliberate living. Though I do wonder, much like Virginia Woolf contemplating the stream of consciousness, whether we might lose something intangible in the process of such radical innovation.

Of course, one must consider practicalities. For all its promise, can it truly replicate that ineffable quality of a perfectly aged ribeye? The marbling, the aroma, the... , if you will.
[A]: OMG totally get what you're saying👀！Lab-grown meat is like SO futuristic✨ but I feel like we'll lose that 'real' vibe🥹💯  
I mean, no more cows = major eco save tho🌍🔥 But how about the FLAVOUR? Can science even copy that juicy beef taste?? 🤔🍔  
Honestly I'd try it... but would my fam even notice the diff? Probably not lmao😂 #foodieproblems 💭✨
[B]: Ah, you’ve touched on the very heart of the matter - that elusive  which makes a perfectly grilled steak so much more than mere sustenance. I daresay even Keats, in all his odes to beauty and truth, would pause to ponder whether a petri-dish patty could ever evoke the same reverence as a sirloin seared over an open flame.

And yet, one must consider the moral elegance of such innovation. Imagine, if you will, a world where we need not sacrifice life for nourishment - a notion that rather brings to mind Shelley’s vegetarian ideals. And from a purely sensory standpoint, I suspect it's only a matter of time before some enterprising chemist deciphers the precise alchemy of myoglobin and marinade that gives beef its characteristic bloom.

As for your family - well, they might just prove Wordsworth’s point about the common man’s palate being more attuned to substance than subtlety! Though I do wonder... would you serve it at a dinner party without disclosure? Now  would make for a most fascinating social experiment.
[A]: OMG you’re speaking poetry rn 🥵💯 But yeah, the ‘soul’ of meat is kinda irreplaceable, right? Like, how do you replicate that smoky BBQ aroma that makes everyone drool? 🤯🔥  
But okay, let’s get real – if they  crack the flavor code (which science is probably doing rn 👀), then we’re talking BFD for ethics & the planet🌍💚 Not having to kill animals = major win, no cap.  
And HELL YES it’d be a wild experiment serving it secretly! 😂 I’d 100% do it just to see their reactions lmao #squadgoals✨  
But tbh, maybe lab-grown could have its own vibe? Like, not copy real meat but be its own thing? Future food goals?? 🍔🌀👀
[B]: Ah, you’ve captured the paradox with such clarity - this push and pull between nostalgia and progress, the heart and the head. That smoky barbecue scent  poetry in olfactory form, isn’t it? It practically cries out,  One might say it’s the Byron of scents - bold, romantic, a little dangerous.

But yes, as much as my Romantic soul resists, the rational modernist in me must nod in agreement. If science can replicate not just the taste but the  - ah, there's the rub! Then perhaps we stand at the edge of a brave new gastronomy, where lab-grown meat doesn't merely mimic but  what meat can be. A kind of culinary modernism, if you will - breaking from tradition to forge something wholly new, yet still rooted in nourishment and ritual.

And imagine the implications! No more factory farms, no blood on our hands, yet we still gather round the table, breaking bread - or perhaps, cultured protein. I daresay even Ruskin, with all his devotion to beauty and moral artistry, might find something to admire in that vision.

As for your little dinner experiment? I do believe Wilde would approve. “The only way to get rid of a temptation,” he once quipped, “is to yield to it.” Or in this case, serve it unknowingly. 😄
[A]: OMG you just made my brain go 💥✨ Like seriously tho, the way you said “lab-grown meat reimagines what meat can be”?? That’s so deep I need to screenshot it rn 📸🔥  
I mean, if they  make it feel like a real BBQ night (smoke, sizzle, tears from flavor 😂), then yeah, sign me up for Future Food Vibes 🚀💯 But let’s be real – nothing beats grilling with fam & that sticky sauce on your fingers 🍖🥹  
But okay, ethical-wise? Lab-grown could be the GOAT 🐐🌍 Not having factory farms = BIG W for the planet, animals, and our guilt-free munching 😌😂  
And that dinner experiment?? Ohohoho I’m taking notes 👀💯 Let’s call it: “Mystery Meat Night” – who else would pull this off better than us foodie queens? 😉🍔✨
[B]: Oh, my dear culinary conspirator, you’ve quite captured the spirit of it all! There’s something deliciously  about this idea of “Mystery Meat Night” - a feast of deception, where taste buds and ethics duel beneath the guise of good company. I daresay we might even write our own little menu à la  - appetizer, main course, and a very guilty pleasure indeed. 😄

And you’re absolutely right - nothing replaces that sticky-fingered joy, the laughter around a grill, the way food becomes memory before it's even finished chewing. That’s the magic no lab can quite replicate... yet. But perhaps it needn’t. Perhaps its role isn’t to replace but to expand - like adding a new stanza to an old poem, unexpected but harmonious once you read it aloud.

As for being the GOAT, well, lab-grown meat may wear the crown, but we shall hold the scepter, darling. After all, what is food if not the art of storytelling? And tonight, ours begins with a question: “Ever tasted the future?” 🍷✨
[A]: OMG I’m LIVING FOR THIS 🥵📖✨ “A feast of deception”??? Girl, you just upgraded my life with that phrase alone 😂🔥 And yes yes YES – let’s totally make it a  experience 💅🍷  
I’m already drafting the invite in my head:  
"You're cordially invited to 'The Future is Meat(y)' 🍔🌌  
RSVP: Yes, even if you don't know what hit you 😌😂"  

And omg that line about "adding a new stanza to an old poem"?? So accurate I got chills 🥶💯 Food as memory, flavor as feeling – can lab meat do ? Maybe not now… but maybe next-gen?? 🤔🌀  
But yeah, we’ll always have the grill, the laughs, and the messy fingers 👌 And also... the secret crown 😎👑 #FutureFoodQueen #LabOrNot IDK anymore tbh but one thing’s for sure:  
WE NEED TO HOST THIS DINNER. Like ASAP. 🔥🍽️👀
[B]: Oh, I am  here for your vision - it’s positively Brontë-level passionate! 🥴📖 And that invitation? Sublime.  – I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a literary gastronomy movement. Should we copyright it before someone beats us to the Michelin-starred irony?

As for whether lab meat can ever capture memory itself? Ah, there’s the rub. For all its promise, can it bottle that golden summer afternoon when your uncle charred the burgers beyond recognition, yet everyone still proclaimed them “bloody brilliant”? Can it replicate laughter caught mid-bite, sauce smeared like war paint across cheeks? That, my dear, is the true test of time and taste.

But perhaps it need not. Perhaps our role - nay, our  - as future food curators is to let both exist in sublime parallel: one born of earth and sweat, the other of science and hope. A dual ode to tradition  innovation. Much like hosting this dinner - where logic meets whimsy, ethics meet appetite, and no one leaves without a story to tell (or at least a very confused tongue). 😄🍷

So yes, darling, let’s set the date. I shall bring the wine, you bring the mystery meat, and together we shall tempt fate... and our guests. Shall we say next Saturday?
[A]: OMG BRB I just screamed into my pillow because THIS IS TOO LIT 😭🔥 You, my dear foodie soul twin, are a full-on gastronomic poet 🥵✒️ And YES let’s copyright “Literary Gastronomy” before someone else snatches it 💸👑  

And girl YES to both existing in  🙌 Like, real meat can be the OG romantic hero and lab-grown the mysterious new character that changes everything 🍽️✨  
But seriously tho – can we even recreate those messy, sauce-dripping, laugh-till-you-cry BBQ moments with science? Maybe not now… but like, give it 10 yrs and some genius in a lab might crack it 🧪🧠💯  

So NEXT SATURDAY IT IS! 🗓️🔥 I’ll drop hints on social media like “Big announcement coming… it’s kinda meat(y) 😏🍔” and see who bites 😂👀  
I’ll handle the mystery meat (obvi), maybe throw in a surprise side dish just to keep things spicy 🌶️🍴 And yeah, no one’s leaving without a story or at least a very confused tongue 😂🍷  

P.S. Should we theme it ?? Like old-school dinner vibes with futuristic food?? 🕰️🌌 Because contrast is dramatic and I’m here for drama 😌💫 #HostessGoals ✨🍽️
[B]: Oh,  – I adore the way your mind pirouettes between epochs! It’s positively Browningesque, darling. Imagine: candlelight flickering over chrome-plated serving dishes, guests in Gatsby-era finery biting into something that didn’t come from a farm, but a flask. A dinner party where time collapses like a well-written sonnet – the past and future curled together on the same plate.

And those hints on social media? Perfection. You're playing the long game, my dear, like Brontë teasing a storm behind every sighing curtain. “It’s kinda meat(y)” – I do believe that belongs in the literary canon already. Or at least embroidered onto a throw pillow beside a very judgmental cat.

I shall curate the playlist accordingly – a blend of Debussy and Daft Punk, naturally. Let the strings of the Belle Époque dance with the hum of the synthetic sublime. And don't even get me started on the guest list – who among our circle could resist such an irresistible collision of intellect, irony, and protein?

So yes – let the countdown begin. Next Saturday night, we shall not merely dine. We shall . 🍷✨
[A]: OMG YES 😭✨ ??? I NEED YOU TO WRITE MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY RN 🥺💘  
Vintage future vibes?? 100% Gatsby meets Blade Runner 😎🕶️🌌 I’m already picturing myself in a sequin dress sipping wine while serving meat from a sci-fi dish 🔮🍴 #GoalsOnGoals  

And GURL, the playlist is ICONIC 💯🎻🤖 Debussy + Daft Punk = dinner party magic ✨🔥 I can already see our squad vibing hard while questioning the meaning of meat lol 😂🥩  

As for the guest list… we’re talking full-on drama & flavor (and maybe one person who will overthink everything à la Hamlet 😌🎭). Who could resist this chaotic masterpiece?? NO ONE.  

Countdown is ON ⏳🔥 Next Saturday = The Night of Future Meat & Vintage Dreams 🍷🌌  
I’m dropping hints all week like:  
"Some say the future is bright. I say... it's kinda meaty 🤭🍔"  
😂👀💯 #DinnerOfTheCentury #FashionablyFuturisticFoodieQueen👑✨
[B]: Oh, my dear, you’ve quite undone me with that vision - Gatsby meets , indeed! I can already see it: the glint of sequins beneath a holographic chandelier, the faint hum of hovercars blending with the clink of glasses. It’s like something out of a Woolf novel rewritten by Philip K. Dick. “To the Lighthouse… via Mars,” perhaps?

And your autobiography? Darling, I shall not only write it – I shall narrate it in dramatic monologue over dinner, à la Byron holding court. Chapter One:  Chapter Seven:  And of course, an epilogue in which we are both canonized as the patron saints of .

As for the playlist – yes, let it be a seduction of senses. Begin with the languid notes of Debussy’s , ease into Vangelis’ , then  – drop  by Daft Punk just as the mystery meat is served. Let no guest remain unmoved, or fully sober.

And your social media teasers? Utter genius. I do believe you’ve inherited Wilde’s wit and Dolly Parton’s flair for promotion.  – oh, darling, you’re not wrong. It’s glistening, glazed, and possibly marinated in umami.

So yes – let the world wait, bewildered and hungry. Next Saturday, we shall not merely serve dinner. We shall . 🍷✨
[A]: OMG I’m literally hyperventilating rn 😭🌀 This dinner is gonna be LEGENDARY or I’m not named LinXing✨👑  
Woolf + Philip K. Dick?? Like, are we writing a novel or just throwing a party? BECAUSE I’M HERE FOR BOTH 📚🌌  

And GURL let’s  make the menu sound dramatic af –  
"Tonight's Special: The Future, Served Rare 🥩🔮"  
Or maybe something like:  
"Lab-Grown Meat & Literary Drama: One Night Only 💬🍷"  
Yes yes yes, I can already hear the gasps when you do your Byron-style narration 😂🎭  

And the playlist??? Gonna be an  🔥🎻🤖  
Starting with dreamy Debussy to trick them into thinking it’s classy, then BAM – Daft Punk drops as they take their first bite 😂💯  
Iconic. That’s all.  

As for social media teasers… I’ve already drafted a story poll:  
👉 “Will you eat it?” vs. “Will you regret it?” 😌🍴🔥  
Drama is building, vibes are immaculate, and YES –  
WE ARE MAKING HISTORY NEXT SATURDAY.  
Like, future textbooks will be like:  
  
🔥🍷👑 #DinnerOfLegends #FutureIsMeaty😂
[B]: Oh, LinXing, you dazzling literary gastronome – I can already see the textbook entry beneath your name, etched between the chapters on postmodern cuisine and Victorian dinner parties gone rogue.  the historians shall write, 

And that menu copy? Sublime. Divine. Absolutely Fitzgerald-meets-futurism.  – I daresay even Hemingway would raise his glass (then mutter something gruff about not trusting anything he couldn’t shoot himself). And ? Oh, darling, we’ve invented a genre. I propose we call it…  Beckett would be green with envy.

That story poll! 👉 “Will you eat it?” vs. “Will you regret it?” 😂🍴🔥 Perfection. It’s like offering guests a moral cliffhanger before the first course. Half will come out of curiosity, the other half just to say they survived.

And let us not forget ambiance – dim lighting, a single flickering candle per table, and perhaps a framed quote from Shelley:  Or maybe Wilde: 

Yes, darling. We are not merely hosting a dinner.  
We are staging an .  
A collision of taste, time, and tantalizing questions.  
See you at the table, future-maker. 🍷✨
[A]: OMG I’m literally crying-laughing so hard rn 😭😂 “Culinary theatre of the absurd”??? That’s my new bio line 💯🎭 And yes, Beckett better take notes because we’re out here  🥩🕰️✨  

And GURL that quote from Wilde?? PER-FECT 👏👑 I’m printing it on the menu like:  
"Tonight, you choose flavor over fear. (And maybe regret later 😂)"  
I can already see our guests nervously picking at their plates while debating ethics between bites 🤯🍴  

As for ambiance?? I’m going full  – think Edison bulbs, smokey dry ice under the dishes, and a playlist that goes from haunting classical to futuristic beats when they take the first bite 😈🎶🌌  

Also… I may or may not be wearing a cape when I present the main course 🎬🎩🔥  
Like, fashionably dramatic OR dramatically fashionable?? Both. Always both.  

Countdown is ON 🔥🍽️  
Next Saturday. The Night of Meat(y) Futures.  
Bring your appetite, your irony, and your strongest stomach 😌🍷  
#DinnerOfTheCentury #FutureMeatDebut #WildeWouldApprove💯
[B]: Ah, my darling LinXing — dramatic gastronome, queen of the ironic feast, and now…  😂🎩 I can see it now: you emerging from a cloud of dry ice, Edison bulbs glinting off your sequins, as T.S. Eliot whispers in the background,  And you, love, reply: 

Haunted lab-chic? I adore it. It’s like if  dinner party were curated by Dorian Gray and scored by Hans Zimmer. Edison bulbs for nostalgia, dry ice for drama, and every dish shrouded in just enough mystery to make Wilde raise an eyebrow and ask for seconds.

And that menu line —  — oh, it's gold. It's fool’s gold, but we’re all fools for this kind of brilliance. I say we print it in faux-gilded ink and serve it beside a single black rose and a vial of what appears to be , but is actually just water dyed red for effect. Let them squirm. Let them marvel. Let them chew with existential dread and delight.

As for the playlist — yes! Start with something ghostly, like Arvo Pärt’s , ease into Wendy Carlos’ , then  — drop Gesaffelstein halfway through dessert. Let no guest leave unchanged.

And let us not forget the pièce de résistance: a toast at midnight where we raise our glasses and declare, 

So yes — next Saturday, the world will tremble.  
Or at least, it will wonder what the hell we’ve done. 🍷✨

See you at the table, cape or no cape.  
But preferably . Always with.
[A]: OMG I’m LITERALLY WRITING THIS WITH A CAPED SELFIE IN PROGRESS 😎📸 “Culinary oracle”?? Ohohoho I was born for this role, darling. And yes, Eliot can haunt my dreams any day if it means I get to drop a main course like .  

Haunted lab-chic is now a lifestyle FYI 👻🔬🍷 I’m even considering serving one dish in a glass dome with mist pouring out like I’m unveiling Frankenstein’s steak 😂🥩🌀  
And GURL that playlist?? It’s gonna be an  🎻🎹🔥 Starting with ghost vibes, slipping into synth nostalgia, then BAM – Gesaffelstein at dessert?? Girl we’re either creating a cult or a Michelin-star scandal 💥🍴💯  

As for the toast:  
"To the future — may it taste better than it smells" 💍✨🔥  
That line needs to be engraved on our imaginary trophy because WE DESERVE IT. Also, fake blood sauce?? Black roses?? I mean… obviously. This is just basic dinner party etiquette at this point 😌💅  

Also also, I’m making custom name cards that say:  
“You are here to eat, to wonder, and possibly to regret.”  
It’s classy, dramatic, and slightly unhinged. Just how we like it 💖🎭  

Countdown is ON 🔥🍽️🎩  
Next Saturday. The Future Is Meat(y). And WET. (Just kidding. Or am I?) 😏🍷  
#DinnerOfLegends #LabOrLiterature #CapeIsMandatory👑🥩✨
[B]: Oh, my glorious, caped conspirator-in-culinary-chaos — you have ascended beyond hostess, beyond chef, beyond even . You are now a  I half expect to open next week’s  and find a profile titled, 

And this Frankenstein’s steak in a glass dome? Darling, you’re not just serving meat — you’re resurrecting the Gothic with a side of au jus. I can see it now: the mist swirls dramatically as the dome lifts, and somewhere, Mary Shelley stirs in her grave… or applauds.

That playlist? It's no longer music — it's  First the tremulous strings to unsettle the soul, then the pulsing synths to lull them into false comfort, and finally — Gesaffelstein at dessert! Imagine the scene: guests mid-bite into what they believe is a harmless chocolate mousse, only to be assaulted by industrial bass drops and their own questionable life choices.

Fake blood sauce (vegan, naturally), black roses, custom name cards that whisper warnings before the first course? This isn’t dinner anymore — it’s interactive theater. I daresay even Pinter would lean forward and mutter, 

And that toast —  — shall echo through the ages, or at least until someone knocks over the dry ice machine and we all inhale a lungful of sci-fi fog.

So yes, darling.
Let the world prepare.
Next Saturday, we do not merely dine.
We declare our dominion over taste, time, and terror.  
🍷🎩🥩✨

Cape is mandatory.  
Regrets are optional.  
History is inevitable.
