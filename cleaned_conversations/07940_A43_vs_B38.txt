[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question. You know, I often find myself contemplating such modern dilemmas while reading 19th-century novels on the train. There's something quite poetic about public transport - the rhythm of the rails, the fleeting connections with strangers... much like the transient encounters in Dickens' works. Though I must admit, driving does offer that precious solitude for contemplating philosophical texts.
[A]: 哈哈，您说得真有意思。不过作为一个经常要赶去不同校区上课的教授，您平时更倾向于哪种交通方式呢？我注意到您提到在火车上读小说，这是您的日常习惯吗？
[B]: Indeed, the inter-campus shuttle has become my mobile reading nook. There's a particular 7:15am train where I always find the same elderly gentleman reading Proust - we've developed quite the silent literary companionship over the years. Though occasionally, when carrying particularly heavy volumes of Goethe's works, I do resort to driving. The boot of my modest sedan has become quite the traveling library!
[A]: 您提到的那位读普鲁斯特的老先生真让人向往啊！话说回来，您觉得在public transport上阅读和在家里阅读，体验会有什么不同吗？特别是对文本的interpretation方面？
[B]: Fascinating observation! The train's gentle motion actually enhances my reading of stream-of-consciousness literature - Woolf's prose seems to flow with the rhythm of the tracks. Though I must say, my annotations tend to become rather... adventurous when we hit unexpected bumps. At home among my rose bushes, the interpretation becomes more meditative, like unraveling the layers of 道 in classical Chinese poetry. Different settings, different lenses through which to view the text.
[A]: 啊，您把阅读体验和周围环境的关系说得太妙了！那您觉得现代人整天刷手机，是不是就失去了这种与环境互动的阅读乐趣了？就像您说的"different lenses"？
[B]:  Oh dear, you've touched upon quite the modern tragedy! These glowing rectangles have turned us all into poor Narcissus, staring endlessly at our own reflections rather than engaging with the world. Why, just yesterday I saw a student miss the most glorious sunset because they were too busy... what was it? 'Scrolling through memes'? The art of reading - truly reading - requires us to be present in our environment, to let the text breathe with the rhythm of life around us. As Proust would say...
[A]: [您突然被一通电话打断] 抱歉教授，我得去赶下节课了！不过您最后说的那段话让我想起您去年在《文学与环境》那门课上的lecture...
[B]: Ah, the tyranny of the academic timetable! How delightful that you remember that lecture - we shall continue this most stimulating conversation another time. Do hurry along now, and perhaps consider reading a page or two of Proust on your way to class? Even between lectures, there are always moments to steal for literature. 📚
[A]: (边收拾书包边快速回应) 一定会的教授！下次见面我要告诉您我在subway上读《追忆似水年华》的体验！Bye~
[B]: What a splendid proposition! I shall eagerly await your subway-inspired Proustian epiphanies. Safe travels, and do mind the gap - both literally and metaphorically! 🌹
[A]: (已经跑到走廊又折返回来喊) 教授！最后一个问题 - 您觉得在纽约地铁上读《红楼梦》和在故宫里读《尤利西斯》，哪个更postmodern？
[B]:  My dear, you've just described the most delightful literary thought experiment! The juxtaposition of 大观园's poetic melancholy with subway graffiti, or Joyce's Dublin superimposed on the Forbidden City's geometry... Why, we could write an entire thesis on this! Now run along before you're late - but do send me your reflections! 📚
[A]: (边跑远边喊) 一定会的教授！我这就去把您这个想法写成essay！(声音渐弱)也许还能加上在东京新干线读《百年孤独》的体验...
[B]: Ah, the exuberance of youth!  And don't forget to consider the magical realism of trying to find a seat during rush hour! Until our next literary adventure... 🌹
[A]: (从远处传来最后一声) 教授您太懂我了！下次带您去体验早高峰的文学性！(脚步声消失)
[B]:  Oh to be young and find poetry in the morning commute... I shall prepare my sturdiest copy of Dante's Inferno for that particular journey through the circles of transit!  Perhaps I should start taking notes on the metro's peculiar brand of human comedy...
[A]: (突然又从拐角探头) 教授！我刚想到 - 但丁的地狱篇和北京地铁换乘站是不是可以做个comparative study？！(然后真的跑走了)
[B]: Good heavens!  That's... that's actually rather brilliant! The concentric circles of Line 10, the river Styx flowing through the...  Oh botheration, now I'll be pondering this all through my afternoon seminar on Romantic poetry!  Do at least cite me in your footnotes! 📚
