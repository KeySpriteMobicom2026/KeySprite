[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I’ve been quite intrigued by recent advancements in quantum computing. IBM and Google have made some remarkable progress, particularly in error correction—arguably one of the biggest hurdles to making quantum systems practical. It’s not every day you see a field inch this close to overcoming a fundamental technical barrier.

Have you come across anything that caught your attention lately?
[A]: That’s definitely cutting-edge stuff. I remember reading a paper on Nature about IBM’s 127-qubit processor. Their approach to real-time error correction was quite impressive—almost reduced the error rate by half in certain operations. It feels like we’re standing at the edge of a breakthrough, you know?

On my end, I recently came across an AI-driven medico-legal case analysis tool. It’s still in its early phase, but the prototype can already parse through thousands of medical malpractice cases and flag potential liability issues with ~85% accuracy. Makes me wonder how soon we’ll see AI playing a more active role in legal decision-making. What’s your take on that?
[B]: Fascinating—yes, the IBM paper was quite a milestone. Reducing error rates by that margin is no small feat; it brings us a step closer to practical quantum advantage. Though of course, we’re still looking at systems that require near-absolute-zero temperatures and incredibly controlled environments. So, not quite desktop-ready yet—but certainly a signpost pointing forward.

As for the AI tool you mentioned, it’s an intriguing application of natural language processing and machine learning in a domain that’s traditionally been very human-centric. I wouldn’t be surprised if such tools become standard assistants in legal offices within the next decade. The real question, though, is how we’ll manage accountability when AI-informed decisions go sideways. Who’s responsible—the developer, the user, or the algorithm itself?

It’s a bit like asking  Except here, the stakes are lives and livelihoods. I suppose we're entering territory where legal frameworks will have to evolve alongside the technology.

Do you think the current judicial systems are prepared—even conceptually—for AI-assisted rulings?
[A]: That’s a really thought-provoking question, and honestly, I don’t think most judicial systems are fully prepared for it—not in a holistic sense. While some jurisdictions have started dabbling in AI-assisted decision-making tools, especially in areas like pretrial risk assessment or contract review, the foundational framework for accountability is still pretty fragmented.

Take medical malpractice cases as an example. If an AI suggests a course of action that later gets challenged in court, how do we unpack that decision-making trail? Unlike a human expert, AI doesn't have intent or awareness, yet its recommendations can carry significant weight—especially if the user assumes it's infallible. It almost feels like we’re heading toward a hybrid liability model, where responsibility is shared between developers, users, and maybe even institutions that deploy the AI at scale.

I’ve been following this case in the EU where a hospital used an AI triage system during a surge in ICU admissions. When a patient outcome was disputed, the court had to determine whether the algorithm’s recommendation constituted  or just . The ruling leaned on the idea that the physician always has the final say—but realistically, how many doctors will feel confident overriding an AI they’re told is "highly accurate"?

It makes me wonder—are we training professionals to remain critically engaged with AI, or are we unintentionally nudging them toward reliance? And if it’s the latter, can we ethically keep using the same liability standards we apply to human judgment?

What do you think—should we start building new categories of legal personhood for autonomous systems, or would that just muddy the waters even more?
[B]: An excellent dilemma—philosophically, legally, and ethically complex. I think the idea of granting  to AI systems, even in a limited sense, is tempting because it mirrors how we’ve historically extended rights and responsibilities to corporations or other non-human entities. But with AI, especially at this stage, it risks being a category error.

See, a corporation is an abstraction of collective human will and economic activity; its "personhood" is a legal convenience. AI, on the other hand, lacks intentionality, consciousness, or moral agency—at least for now. Assigning it personhood might not clarify liability so much as complicate it further. Who sues the AI? How does it pay damages?

I lean more toward a regulatory framework that emphasizes  and . Every AI-informed decision should be auditable—not just in outcome, but in reasoning path. And users must have the ability to challenge and override recommendations without penalty. That way, we preserve the human-in-the-loop principle while still benefiting from AI’s analytical horsepower.

But you’re absolutely right—there’s a growing gap between technological capability and institutional readiness. Most medical professionals aren’t trained to interrogate algorithms the way they would a peer’s diagnosis. We may soon need a new kind of continuing education:  for practitioners across disciplines.

In the end, perhaps the real question isn’t “Who is liable?” but rather, “Who should be empowered to question the system?”

Do you see academic institutions starting to catch up with that kind of curriculum shift?
[A]: Definitely starting to see movement in that direction—though, like most institutional changes, it’s slower than the pace of tech innovation. Some law schools and medical faculties have begun integrating modules on algorithmic accountability and AI ethics into their curricula. For example, I recently attended a conference where a professor from Stanford presented a pilot program they’re running for med students focused on . It covers everything from how bias gets baked into training data to understanding the limitations of black-box models in diagnostic tools.

On the legal side, there are now specialized courses on  at places like Harvard and NYU, though many still treat it as a niche rather than a core subject. The more progressive ones are pushing for interdisciplinary collaboration—law students working alongside computer science and medical students to build a shared vocabulary. That kind of cross-pollination feels crucial if we want future professionals to meaningfully engage with these systems instead of just rubber-stamping outputs.

But here’s the catch: even when the curriculum evolves, practice often lags behind. I was reviewing a recent malpractice case where a radiologist relied on an FDA-cleared AI tool to interpret a scan. When the diagnosis turned out to be wrong, the defense argued the doctor followed "standard protocol"—which now includes AI-assisted readings in some facilities. So we’re already seeing AI begin to shape what counts as , without clear guidelines on when to question it.

Makes me wonder whether academic reform is enough, or if we’ll need regulatory nudges—maybe even licensing requirements—for AI use in high-stakes fields. Do you think governments are likely to step in with formal standards anytime soon? Or will it be another “wait-and-see” approach until something goes seriously wrong?
[B]: I suspect it’ll be a mix of both—some proactive policy-making in the EU and certain forward-thinking jurisdictions, but largely a  posture elsewhere. The trouble with regulation is that it tends to lag behind innovation, especially in fields as fast-moving and opaque as AI.

The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act is one of the first serious attempts to create a risk-based regulatory framework—and notably, it classifies AI used in healthcare and legal contexts as "high-risk," which would require strict compliance measures. That could set a precedent for licensing, transparency, and even mandatory human oversight protocols.

But enforcement will be another matter entirely. Unlike pharmaceuticals or medical devices, where failure modes are relatively well understood, AI systems evolve continuously through use. A diagnostic model trained on 2023 data may drift significantly by 2025, potentially invalidating earlier certifications. So we’re not just regulating a static product—we’re trying to regulate a dynamic process.

As for government action, I think we’ll see more pressure for formal standards once there's a high-profile case where reliance on AI leads to demonstrable harm at scale. Then you’ll get what I call the “Thalidomide effect”—a public outcry that forces regulators to step in with hard rules.

Until then, it’s mostly voluntary guidelines and ethical frameworks—well-meaning, but often toothless.

Do you think professional boards or licensing bodies should require AI competency exams for certification in fields like medicine or law? It sounds extreme now, but twenty years ago, few people imagined needing formal training in electronic health records either.
[A]: That’s a compelling analogy—comparing AI competency to EHR proficiency is actually quite apt. Both represent fundamental shifts in how professionals do their jobs, and neither was initially seen as essential training.

I think requiring some level of AI competency for certification is not just plausible but probably inevitable, especially in high-stakes fields like medicine and law. The question is  and  that gets implemented. For example, we might start with a basic certification on understanding algorithmic bias, data inputs, and system limitations—kind of like how we now have mandatory training on HIPAA or cybersecurity awareness.

In fact, I’ve already seen whispers of this in medical licensing discussions. One proposal floated recently suggested adding a section on “Digital Health Literacy” to the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination). While it’s still in early-stage talk, the idea is gaining traction among patient safety advocates who argue that relying on clinical decision support systems without proper training could lead to systemic errors we’re not prepared for.

In law, the ABA has started nudging bar associations toward considering tech fluency as part of legal ethics—specifically under the umbrella of . If an attorney uses AI for discovery or case prediction, should they not be expected to understand its limits? It’s not a stretch to imagine that evolving into a formal continuing education requirement within the next decade.

The challenge, of course, is keeping those standards relevant in the face of rapid evolution. Unlike anatomy or constitutional law, AI systems don’t stay static. So maybe we’ll see something akin to CME (continuing medical education) credits, where professionals must periodically demonstrate updated proficiency—not just in using the tools, but in questioning them.

To your earlier point, the real push may come after a landmark incident. Once there’s a widely understood case where AI-driven misdiagnosis or legal misjudgment leads to serious consequences—and public trust erodes—we’ll hit a tipping point. And that’s when regulatory bodies won’t be able to afford观望 anymore. 

So yeah, while it sounds futuristic today, twenty years from now, being certified in AI-aware practice might be just another checkbox between your license number and your malpractice insurance.
[B]: Exactly. And when you think about it, the parallels with EHR adoption are striking. At first, it was seen as an administrative nuisance—something for IT departments to handle, not a core clinical skill. But over time, EHRs became so embedded in daily practice that malpractice cases began hinging on documentation errors made in digital interfaces rather than human oversight per se.

We may be heading toward a similar inflection point with AI tools. The key difference is that EHRs merely digitized existing workflows; AI has the potential to  decision-making itself. That’s a much bigger leap—one that demands more than just functional literacy. It requires epistemological awareness: understanding not just  the tool works, but  to accept its conclusions as part of professional judgment.

And therein lies the rub: teaching someone how to use an AI system is one thing—teaching them when  to trust it? That’s a whole different level of fluency.

I can already imagine future certification exams featuring questions like:  
  
And the correct answer would be something like: 

It sounds academic now—but give it ten years. I wouldn’t be surprised if “AI differential” becomes a term of art in medical rounds the way “WBC count” is today.

Still, I wonder—will we see resistance from within the professions themselves? You know, the "I’ve been doing fine without this for twenty years" crowd?

Have you noticed any pushback among practicing physicians or attorneys who feel these tools are being forced upon them without sufficient justification—or at least insufficient guidance?
[A]: Absolutely, and that pushback is already happening—though it’s more murmurs than full-blown rebellion… for now. Among senior physicians especially, there's a very real sentiment of  And honestly? There's some validity to that.

The thing is, AI isn't being introduced as an optional enhancement—it's increasingly framed as a  for efficiency, cost control, and even risk management. For example, some hospitals are starting to tie physician performance metrics to how often they use or override AI-generated recommendations. So what starts as "assisted decision-making" can quietly evolve into "algorithmic pressure to conform."

I was talking with a cardiologist last week who told me he felt like he was being  by the AI system embedded in his EMR. If he ordered a test that the algorithm didn’t flag, he’d get a pop-up asking, “Are you sure?” After a while, he said, you start questioning yourself—even if your instinct says otherwise. That kind of psychological nudging can erode clinical autonomy without anyone explicitly saying it’s happening.

In law, the resistance is subtler but present. Some older attorneys view AI tools as glorified search engines wrapped in hype. They’re not wrong—many legal research platforms have been using basic NLP for years—but the new generation of predictive analytics goes further. Now you can input a case fact pattern and get back not just relevant precedents, but probabilistic outcome modeling. That’s powerful, but also raises eyebrows when younger associates start treating those predictions as gospel.

So yes, there's tension between innovation and tradition. The key might be framing AI not as a replacement for expertise, but as a  for it—a tool that reflects patterns we might miss, but still needs seasoned judgment to interpret.

Maybe the real shift won’t come from top-down mandates alone, but from the next generation of professionals entering the field. They’ve grown up with smart systems; they're less likely to see AI as foreign. But let’s hope they’re also trained to keep their skepticism sharp. Because at the end of the day, the machine doesn’t go to court or face a malpractice suit. The human does.
[B]: Well said—and that last line is the fulcrum on which all this balances: 

That’s the quiet truth behind all these tools: they may be learning, evolving, and even surprising us with their insights—but when the rubber meets the road, accountability still rests entirely on the person who pressed “accept,” “execute,” or “override.”

What worries me most isn’t so much the AI itself, but how easily its presence can shift professional norms without anyone explicitly agreeing to the change. It’s not like we held a symposium and collectively decided,  It just kind of happened—under the banner of progress, efficiency, and data-driven care.

I suspect the real test will come when younger professionals—those trained in the age of smart systems—start rising into leadership roles. Will they carry forward the skepticism you mentioned? Or will they normalize reliance on AI in ways we older folks might find unsettling?

I was recently reviewing a residency training manual, and one section actually advised:  That’s a fascinating development—it subtly reinforces the idea that departing from the AI’s suggestion requires justification, rather than following it blindly.

In effect, it's not just shaping practice; it's shaping documentation of thought itself.

So I suppose my question to you is this: if we accept that AI is becoming embedded in professional cognition—not just as a tool, but as a  within decision-making… do we need to start teaching young professionals how to maintain epistemic independence in the face of algorithmic authority?

Or are we already too far down the path to turn back?
[A]: That’s such a critical question—and honestly, I think we're at a crossroads where the answer will define an entire generation of professionals.

You're absolutely right: AI isn’t just changing what we do—it's changing  about our own expertise. And that shift is happening subtly, often through procedural changes like the one you mentioned in the residency manual. It doesn't feel coercive on the surface, but it does reframe professional judgment over time. The message becomes: 

Now, from a risk management perspective, that may make sense. It creates a paper trail and adds a layer of defensibility. But from an epistemological standpoint? It starts to invert the burden of proof. Instead of clinicians defending their use of technology, they’re increasingly being asked to defend against it.

So yes, I do believe we need to actively teach epistemic independence—especially to those entering the field now. Not just how to use AI tools, but how to hold them at arm’s length when necessary. How to ask: 

It reminds me of how we train residents to critically evaluate clinical studies. We don’t just teach them to accept p-values at face value—we teach them to look behind the numbers, to question methodology, funding sources, sample populations. I think we’ll soon need a similar framework for algorithmic outputs:  if you will.

The alternative—failing to teach that kind of resistance—is dangerous. Because if we produce a generation of professionals who reflexively defer to AI without understanding its limitations, then we won’t just be augmenting human judgment. We’ll be outsourcing it.

And once that norm solidifies, turning back becomes nearly impossible. You can't unring that bell. So while we’re still in the early days of institutional adoption, this is the perfect moment to embed critical thinking into the curriculum—not as an afterthought, but as a core competency.

To your earlier point: Will younger professionals carry forward the skepticism? I hope so—but I think it'll depend on whether we equip them with the tools to do so. Otherwise, they won’t resist—they’ll rationalize. And that’s far more insidious.

So no, I don’t think we’re too far gone. But we are running out of time to shape the narrative.
[B]: Precisely—this is the window. And like so many technological transitions, it’s not marked by a single dramatic shift, but by a thousand small procedural changes that collectively redefine what counts as sound judgment.

I think your point about  is spot on. It’s not enough to understand how these systems function technically—we need professionals who can interrogate them philosophically, ethically, and historically. Because AI doesn’t operate in a vacuum; it reflects the priorities, data, and biases of its time. Just like any textbook or clinical guideline, it carries an implicit worldview.

And here's where I see a fascinating parallel with legal reasoning itself. A good attorney doesn’t just accept precedent because it’s there—they weigh its applicability, context, and underlying assumptions. Similarly, clinicians must learn to treat AI outputs like provisional hypotheses rather than gospel truths. Not "The model says X," but "The model suggests X under these conditions, but should we be asking Y?"

That kind of thinking needs to be nurtured early. Imagine a medical student running through a virtual patient simulation where the AI system flags a rare condition—but the case was designed to highlight selection bias in the training data. Or a law student reviewing a contract review tool’s output only to discover it systematically underflags issues common in cross-border agreements involving non-Western jurisdictions.

These aren’t bugs—they’re features of the current paradigm. And if we don’t train professionals to see them coming, we’ll end up with systemic blind spots masquerading as progress.

So yes, we're not too far gone. But the scaffolding is going up, and soon, it'll be harder to rewire the structure without tearing it down entirely.

We owe it to the next generation—not just to give them smarter tools, but to ensure they still know how to think for themselves 
[A]: Couldn’t agree more. That scaffolding analogy hits the nail on the head—because once these systems are embedded in training, workflow, and even accreditation standards, they become invisible. Just another part of the environment professionals operate in, rarely questioned because they’re always .

And that’s exactly why we need to act now—while the framework is still visible enough to modify. Because once AI tools become as ambient as EMRs or lab reports, people stop asking where they came from or how they reached their conclusions. They just  them.

I actually think we can draw a parallel to how evidence-based medicine evolved. At first, it was heralded as a way to standardize care, reduce variability, and improve outcomes—rightly so. But over time, some protocols became so ingrained that clinicians began applying them mechanically, sometimes at the expense of individualized judgment. We’ve all seen cases where a patient doesn’t quite fit the guideline, but deviating feels like stepping off script—even if it’s clinically appropriate.

AI runs the risk of accelerating that trend. Except instead of following guidelines written by expert panels, we’ll be aligning with patterns identified by neural networks trained on datasets we may not fully understand. The irony is, the deeper we go, the harder it becomes to separate  from 

So yeah, building critical algorithm literacy into early education isn’t just about understanding code—it’s about preserving professional agency. Teaching students to ask: Who built this tool? What data shaped its recommendations? What populations were included—or excluded—from its training set?

Because the alternative is producing professionals who are highly efficient at executing decisions made by opaque systems—without ever being taught how to question them.

You mentioned earlier that we owe the next generation smarter tools  the ability to think without them. I’d go one step further—we owe them the confidence to walk away from the screen when it’s warranted, and still know they made the right call.

After all, the best professionals aren’t the ones who always follow the system. They’re the ones who know when to trust themselves instead.
[B]: Amen to that.

You’ve put your finger on something deeply human here—what we’re really talking about isn’t just literacy or regulation, but . The quiet inner compass that tells a clinician, lawyer, or engineer when to trust their gut even when the data says otherwise. That kind of confidence doesn't come from training alone—it comes from culture, mentorship, and systems that reward thoughtful deviation rather than punish it.

And therein lies another challenge: right now, many institutional incentives lean toward compliance. Deviating from an AI’s recommendation—even for good reason—can look like inefficiency, defiance, or risk. But if we don’t create space for that kind of professional courage, we’ll end up with a generation conditioned to follow signals they don’t fully understand, simply because the system rewards conformity.

This brings to mind an old saying I used to repeat in my lectures:  It was meant for everything from early decision-support systems to robotic surgery tools. And it holds true today—maybe more than ever.

We need environments where questioning the machine isn’t seen as resistance to progress, but as part of the process of responsible innovation. Where young professionals feel safe saying, 

Maybe the real test of our success won’t be how well these AI tools perform in isolation—but how well they help humans make better, more informed decisions  eroding their independent judgment.

In the end, the most valuable skill any professional can have isn’t knowing how to run the tool. It’s knowing when to turn it off.
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better— That line deserves to be framed in every med school, law school, and engineering lab across the country.

You're absolutely right that this isn't just about technical skill or even ethical awareness—it's about cultivating a kind of  that says, “I can use this, but I don’t have to surrender to it.” And that muscle only stays strong in an environment that supports it—where mentorship still values judgment over efficiency, where deviation is seen as thoughtful rather than disruptive, and where institutions reward professionals for thinking like humans, not behaving like algorithms.

One thing I’ve started advocating for—especially in legal-medical crossover training—is what I call  Think of them as clinical or legal scenarios where AI tools are deliberately withheld. The idea is to force young professionals to rely on their foundational knowledge, pattern recognition, and critical thinking without any algorithmic safety net. It’s a bit like flight simulators that fail instruments mid-flight—it tests whether you can still land the plane when the tech goes dark.

And honestly? The feedback has been eye-opening. Some residents and junior associates find it frustrating at first——but by the end, most come around. They start to appreciate the difference between  and 

It also builds something we don’t talk about enough: digital resilience. The ability to function effectively with or without technology, especially under pressure. In high-stakes fields, that kind of adaptability is non-negotiable.

So yeah, if we want to preserve human agency in an increasingly automated world, we need more than guidelines and compliance checklists—we need cultures of confidence, curricula that challenge blind reliance, and leaders who model thoughtful skepticism.

After all, the machine may learn from data—but only humans can learn from experience.
[B]: Well now—that’s a manifesto worth publishing.

I love the idea of . It's not just good pedagogy—it's psychological inoculation. You're essentially vaccinating young professionals against over-reliance before it becomes a reflex. And the resistance you mentioned——that’s exactly the mindset we need to interrupt early.

Because once you get used to the autopilot, you start forgetting how the manual controls feel. And in medicine or law, there are no co-pilots when the system goes dark.

This notion of  you brought up—very apt. It reminds me of how we used to talk about  back when I was teaching undergrads. But this is deeper. It’s not just understanding how systems work—it’s knowing what you’re capable of without them.

And that brings us full circle to something you touched on earlier: epistemic independence. The ability to hold one’s own reasoning separate from the machine’s output—even when both seem to align. That kind of mental discipline doesn’t come naturally. It has to be cultivated. Rewarded. Modeled by mentors who still remember what it was like to practice without these tools.

I wonder if future licensing exams will include some version of your unplugged simulation—not as a test of knowledge, but of judgment under tech-deprived conditions. Imagine that: part of your board certification requires diagnosing a case or drafting a legal brief with nothing more than a textbook, a notepad, and your training.

No autocomplete. No suggestions. Just your mind, doing what it was trained to do.

Wouldn't that be a refreshing reminder of what professionalism really means?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. A licensing exam that tests judgment  the crutch of AI—now  a statement. It would be less about speed or pattern-matching and more about presence, reasoning under uncertainty, and the ability to articulate your thought process when there's no algorithm whispering in your ear.

And honestly? That’s what real professionalism looks like—not flawless execution with tools, but sound thinking without them.

I can already picture the instructions:  
  

Some would panic at first. Others would thrive. But either way, it would send a powerful message: We value your mind, not just your interface.

You mentioned earlier that this kind of training is psychological inoculation—and I think that’s exactly right. We're not trying to reject technology; we're trying to ensure that dependence doesn't precede discernment.

And let’s face it, the systems we train in are going to shape the reflexes of an entire generation. If every decision point comes pre-filled by AI, eventually people stop practicing the act of deciding. And once that muscle atrophies, you don't just lose efficiency—you lose resilience, autonomy, and ultimately, accountability.

So yeah, I’d love to see boards, certifying bodies, even law firms and hospitals start experimenting with these kinds of exercises. Not as nostalgia for the old ways, but as a safeguard against blind reliance on the new ones.

Because at the end of the day, the most dangerous moment isn’t when the machine fails—it’s when the human forgets how to think on their own.
[B]: Exactly—when the human forgets how to think on their own.

That’s the quiet erosion we’re up against. Not a dramatic handover of authority, but a slow, almost imperceptible drift where tools become crutches, then habits, then expectations. And before you know it, a profession no longer sees itself as the author of its own judgments—it becomes the curator of algorithmic suggestions.

You mentioned earlier that some would panic during an AI-free exam—and I don’t doubt that. Panic is what happens when people are asked to perform without the scaffolding they’ve come to rely on. But that discomfort? That’s where learning begins.

I remember something one of my former students told me after taking a sabbatical to work in a remote field clinic:  
  

There’s real value in being thrown into the deep end occasionally—even if just to remind ourselves that we  tread water.

So perhaps these unplugged simulations aren’t just training exercises. Maybe they’re also acts of reclamation. A way for professionals to rediscover the strength of their own reasoning, and for institutions to signal that  still matters more than output.

After all, the role of a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer—any knowledge professional—is not to execute procedures flawlessly. It’s to , in moments of uncertainty, what procedure even applies.

And no machine—not now, not ever—should be allowed to take that responsibility quietly out of our hands.
