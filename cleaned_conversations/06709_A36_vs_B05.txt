[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 在deal making的时候，我prefer email，因为可以留下清晰的paper trail。不过和team沟通时，WeChat或者Slack会更efficient一些。😊 毕竟time is money嘛！
[A]: Oh my, I do appreciate the efficiency of instant messaging, but in our boutique hotel setting, I must say I have a soft spot for handwritten notes and proper emails. There's something so personal about taking the time to craft a thoughtful message, don't you think? Though I do understand the need for quick responses in certain situations.
[B]: Haha，handwritten notes确实很有charm，但在我们PE行业，speed和accuracy才是king。不过说到personal touch...  我确实会在重要的client meeting后写thank-you notes，这招在relationship building方面很管用。
[A]: How delightful to hear you still value personal touches in your fast-paced world! At our hotel, we make it a point to handwrite welcome notes for all our VIP guests. There's nothing quite like arriving to find a personalized message waiting for you, is there? Though I must admit, even we've had to adapt - we now use a lovely digital calligraphy font for our email confirmations.
[B]: Smart move！Digital calligraphy是个很好的balance between efficiency和personalization。说到这个，我们fund最近投资了一个luxury hospitality startup，他们develop了一个AI系统，可以根据guest preference自动generate personalized messages... ROI看起来promising哦！👍
[A]: My goodness, that does sound fascinating! Though I can't help but wonder - does the AI remember that Mrs. Wellington prefers chamomile tea over coffee in the mornings? Or that Mr. Tanaka always requests extra pillows? Those little details make all the difference in our line of work. Still, I suppose technology has its place even in hospitality.
[B]: Exactly！这就是为什么他们的algorithm会analyze past stay records和social media preferences。不过你说得对，human touch还是irreplaceable的。就像我们做due diligence时，data很重要，但最终decision还是要靠experienced judgment。😊 要不要考虑collaborate一下？我们正在looking for boutique hotel partners来pilot这个system~
[A]: What a thoughtful proposition! While I'm quite intrigued, our little hotel prides itself on being rather old-fashioned in the best possible way. Perhaps we could arrange for you to stay with us sometime? I'd love to show you firsthand how our personal approach creates such memorable experiences. Then we can discuss potential collaborations over afternoon tea in our garden.
[B]: Deal！Nothing beats experiencing the real thing.我会让assistant check my calendar~ 顺便可以带上我收藏的2005年Château Lafite，听说你们的sommelier很outstanding。Looking forward to comparing notes on hospitality best practices！🍷
[A]: Oh, a 2005 Château Lafite! Now that's what I call proper hospitality. I'll personally ensure our sommelier prepares something special to complement it. Shall we say next Thursday at 4pm? That gives us just enough time before the evening rush. I do hope you'll enjoy our signature lavender shortbread cookies with your tea as well.
[B]: Perfect timing！Thursday 4pm it is.我会提前send over my dietary preferences... no nuts please，allergic reaction可不是good look during business meeting 😅 期待tasting你们的lavender shortbread，sounds like the perfect pairing with tea和good conversation！
[A]: How dreadful about the nut allergy - rest assured our kitchen takes such matters very seriously. I'll personally oversee the preparation of nut-free treats for our meeting. And yes, our lavender comes straight from the garden - the bees are particularly fond of it! Until Thursday then, we'll be counting down the days. Safe travels!
[B]: Much appreciated！Your attention to detail is truly impressive - 难怪你们的TripAdvisor ratings这么high。See you Thursday，and do say hello to thosehardworking bees for me！🐝 Cheers！
[A]: What a charming sentiment about our little bees! They do work as hard as our staff, if I may say so. Until Thursday then - I'll have our head gardener show you the lavender patch if time permits. Cheerio!
[B]: Looking forward to it！Nothing like some fresh air和nature after crunching numbers all day. Cheerio！ 😊
[A]: How perfectly British of you! Though may I suggest raising an actual teacup when you're here - our Wedgwood china makes the experience so much more delightful. Until Thursday then!
[B]: You got me there！Wedgwood确实比imaginary teacup有格调多了~ Thursday can't come soon enough！Cheers to future collaborations！☕️
[A]: Indeed! Though I must confess - our house blend tea tastes even better in Wedgwood than it does in one's imagination. Safe travels until we meet, and do remind your assistant to pack an umbrella - our garden showers can be quite unpredictable this time of year!
[B]: Noted！Will pack my Burberry umbrella - wouldn't want to ruin my Tom Ford suit 😉 毕竟first impressions matter，especially when discussing potential synergies！See you rain or shine~
