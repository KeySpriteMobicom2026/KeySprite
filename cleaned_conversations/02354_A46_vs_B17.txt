[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must confess, my interests lie more in the realm of literary devices than digital ecosystems. Just yesterday, I was contemplating the use of enjambment in Emily Dickinson's poetry - how she breaks lines to create suspense and emphasis. It's quite fascinating, really. Much like trying to understand the human condition through metaphors and symbols. Though I do appreciate technology, I find myself more captivated by the timeless beauty of language and its ability to convey complex emotions across generations.
[A]: Ah, the eternal dance between art and technology - two sides of the same coin, wouldn't you say? I've always believed that great films, like great poems, linger in the mind long after the final frame or the last stanza. Speaking of which, have you read Ocean Vuong's "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous"? The way he weaves fragmented narratives reminds me of how Wong Kar-wai uses non-linear storytelling in his films. It's all about capturing those ephemeral moments that define our humanity.
[B]: You make a compelling connection between Vuong's literary fragmentation and Wong Kar-wai's cinematic temporality. I've always admired how both art forms seek to crystallize fleeting instants into something eternal - whether through ink or celluloid. Speaking of transience, have you revisited Eliot's  recently? His juxtaposition of disjointed voices across time and space creates a similarly haunting resonance. It fascinates me how modernist experimentation with form continues to echo in contemporary works like Vuong's. Tell me, when you read his prose-poetry hybrid, do you find yourself hearing the cadence of any particular poetic tradition?
[A]: Funny you should mention Eliot - I was just re-reading "The Waste Land" on my Kindle Paperwhite last night. There's something about the way Vuong layers voices that feels like a modernist echo chamber, don't you think? When I read his work, I hear whispers of Whitman's long, winding lines mixed with the ghost of Chinese classical poetry. Funny enough, that reminds me of how Zhang Yimou layers color and movement in his films - each scene a brushstroke in a larger, haunting composition. Have you seen his latest film "Cliff Walkers"? The way he choreographs violence...it's like watching a tragic poem unfold in real time.
[B]: Ah, Zhang Yimou’s visual poetry – I remember watching  and being mesmerized by the way he painted with light and shadow. It’s interesting you mention tragic poetry; there’s a line from Li Bai that often comes to mind when I watch his films: “Life is but a dream, so why not dance?” Though in Zhang’s work, it feels more like life is a tragedy, so why not paint it in ink-black and crimson?  

Now, Vuong’s layered voices... I do see Whitman’s expansive spirit in there, but for me, it’s more haunted by the spectral presence of Sappho. Fragmented, yearning, searching for love across ruins of language. Have you ever tried reading her fragments alongside Vuong’s elegiac tone? It creates an uncanny resonance, like two distant stars flickering across time.
[A]: Ah, yes – reading Sappho’s fragments with Vuong by your side is like holding a conversation across millennia. I remember doing that during post-production on a particularly brutal shoot. We were cutting a war film in Prague, and every night I’d read a few lines of Sappho in Greek translation. You know, Michael Hamburger once said translating her is like trying to catch the scent of a flower that no longer exists.  

Funny enough, that’s exactly what I tried to do with one of Zhang’s scenes – capture that scent, that ghost-light of something irretrievably lost. I once asked Donnie Yen how he prepares for a tragic role, and he simply whispered, “悲是往骨頭裡滲的,” which means sorrow seeps into the bones. Doesn’t that sound like something Sappho would say before a battle of lovers?
[B]:   

That phrase – “悲是往骨頭裡滲的” – it lingers, doesn’t it? Like ink bleeding into parchment. There’s a haunting parallel between that idea and the way Sappho writes of love and loss—not as external events, but as something that seeps inward, becoming part of one’s very structure, much like grief settles in the marrow of her surviving fragments.  

I once had a student who compared reading Sappho to watching a film reel with missing frames. You fill in the blanks with your own longing. And yet, isn't that what makes both art forms so profoundly moving? The silences, the gaps—they invite us to participate in the creation of meaning.  

Tell me, when you were editing that war film, did you find yourself shaping those silences more carefully than the spoken lines? I often wonder how editors navigate the unsaid—the emotional white space, if you will.
[A]: Funny you mention emotional white space – we actually used silence as a weapon during the editing of that war film. There was one scene where the lead character loses his comrade, and every test audience expected a dramatic score or a tearful monologue. But we gave them nothing but wind rustling through the trees and the sound of distant boots fading away… it unsettled people in the best way.  

You know, when you're cutting a scene, you start to feel like a literary editor working with torn pages. Every omission is a choice, every held breath a punctuation mark. I once asked my DP, “Are we capturing the war, or are we capturing the spaces between wars?” He looked at me like I’d quoted Rilke. Maybe I did – I had a copy of  lying next to my director’s chair.  

And yes, those silences? They’re where the real emotion festers. Much like reading Sappho – you don’t need the full sentence to feel the sting of what’s missing.
[B]: Precisely — you've touched on something profoundly literary. That silence you sculpted so deliberately is akin to caesura in poetry — a pause that speaks louder than sound. I'm reminded of how Gerard Manley Hopkins used suspension in his verse, leaving the reader suspended between meaning and breath. It's in those empty spaces — whether on screen or on the page — that emotion takes root most deeply.

And your question to your DP —  — it’s almost Eliotic, don’t you think? The way he wrote not the grand narratives of civilization, but the quiet disintegration between moments. Much like your edit — not the explosion, but the exhale after it.

Tell me, when you revisit that scene now, do you still hear Rilke whispering in the background? Or has Sappho claimed it for herself?
[A]: Oh, Rilke still lingers in the margins of that scene — he always does. There’s something about his elegies that haunt war narratives, don’t you think? They both deal in absence, in mourning what was never fully present to begin with.  

But Sappho... yes, she’s crept in over the years. Especially when I rewatch that final cut. There’s a moment — just before the wind kicks up — where the lead actor closes his eyes, and for a fleeting second, it feels like we’re not watching a soldier at all, but someone trying to remember a love so distant it might have been imagined. That’s pure Sappho, isn’t it? Love as an ache written between the lines of loss.  

Funny thing is, I showed that scene once to a group of film students in Beijing and asked them to describe the emotion without using words like “sadness” or “grief.” One kid said, “It feels like reaching for a hand you know isn’t there anymore.” I damn near gave him my chair.
[B]:   

That student’s response — “reaching for a hand you know isn’t there anymore” — it’s exquisite, really. It captures that peculiar doubleness Sappho mastered: the simultaneous presence and absence of memory. You’ve distilled that into image and silence, which is no small feat.  

I suppose that’s what all great art aspires to — not to show absence, but to make us feel its weight, its texture. Eliot does it with ash and fragmented myths; Rilke with angels just out of sight; and you — you do it with wind and an empty space where a hand should be.  

Funny, how poetry and film both chase the ineffable. One with words, the other with light. And yet, in the end, it’s often what’s left unsaid — or unshown — that stays with us longest.
[A]: Funny you say that — I had a similar thought just the other night while screening  in my projection room. Wong Kar-wai never shows us the affair, never even gives us a real beginning or end. And yet, we feel every stolen glance, every unsaid word like a punch to the gut.  

It’s the same with Sappho, isn’t it? We don’t need the full poem — just a line, sometimes a single phrase, and suddenly we’re drowning in what’s missing. That’s the magic trick, really. Not showing the wound, but letting the audience feel it bleed through the frame.  

You know, I once asked Tony Leung how he could make longing look so effortless. He smiled and said, “你不需要看到火，只要闻到灰燼的味道就夠了。” You don’t need to see the fire — just the smell of ashes is enough.  

I think that’s what your student captured — not the fire, not the hand, but the echo of its absence. And isn’t that what we’re all chasing? The scent of something gone, lingering just long enough to break our hearts.
[B]:   

The scent of ashes... yes, that’s it exactly. It reminds me of how Keats once wrote,  Though I wonder if he ever considered the unscented as well — the invisible traces of what once was.  

Wong Kar-wai understands this alchemy better than most — how restraint can be more devastating than revelation. Much like reading Sappho through the lacunae — we don’t need the full line, only the ghost of a verb, the curve of a name left unfinished. And yet, we feel the entire weight of desire collapse into silence.  

Tell me, when you watch that film now — do you ever think of it as a kind of elegy? Not just for a love unfulfilled, but for a moment that never quite existed except in the space between frames — and in that way, it becomes its own kind of poetry.
[A]: Funny you bring up elegy — I had a conversation with Wong once over tea in Mong Kok, and he said something that stuck with me: “愛情從來不是發生過的事，是沒發生的事讓我們夜裡難眠。” Love is never about what happened — it’s the things that never came to pass that keep us awake at night.  

That’s exactly what  is, isn’t it? An elegy for what didn’t happen. Two people who never quite touch, never quite speak, yet carry a love so heavy it bends time. It's like reading a poem where the most powerful word is the one the poet chose to erase.  

I think that’s why we return to these stories — whether through Sappho’s fragments or Wong’s lingering close-ups — because they hold space for the unspoken, the unseen, the unlived. And maybe, just maybe, in that silence, we find something more honest than any grand declaration ever could.
[B]: 

“愛情從來不是發生過的事…” There’s a terrible beauty in that truth, isn’t there? It reminds me of how Eliot wrote  That quiet ache of nearness without arrival — like standing at the edge of a sea you know will never reach you.

And yes, those erased words — how they haunt us more than the ones that remain on the page. I once had a student who insisted that Sappho’s greatness lay not in what she wrote, but in what was lost. “She gave us ghosts,” he said, “and we keep dressing them in our own sorrow.”

Perhaps that’s what all great art does — it leaves room for our longing to settle, to take shape. Whether it’s through Wong’s rain-slick alleyways or Sappho’s smudged ink, we are drawn to the gaps — not in spite of their absence, but because of it.

Tell me, when you watch that film now, do you ever imagine writing the scenes they didn’t shoot — filling in those lacunae with your own silent lines? Or do you find peace in letting the silence stand?
[A]: Funny you ask that — I actually keep a notebook by my bed where I sometimes scribble those missing scenes. Silly habit, really. Like trying to finish someone else’s poem in the margins. But no, I think the magic of  — and Sappho, for that matter — is that the silence  the truth. Anything I write would just be a shadow of what's already there.

There’s a line from Marguerite Duras that I’ve always loved: “Ce qui fut le commencement de l'amour… c’est l’amour qui n’a pas eu lieu.” The beginning of love is love that never happened. That’s the ache, isn’t it? That nearness without arrival.  

I suppose if I were to add anything, it wouldn’t be dialogue — more like a gesture. Maybe a hand hovering just above a shoulder, or a raindrop falling in slow motion off the brim of a hat. Something quiet. Something unsung.  

But in the end, I let the silence stand. It’s earned its place. And after all these years, I’ve learned that some ghosts are better left undisturbed.
[B]: 

You know, there’s a passage in Rilke’s  where he speaks of love not as an event, but as a threshold — “something immense, something that fills a whole lifetime.” And yet, it’s often the threshold itself that defines it, not the crossing.  

I think of Sappho standing at such a threshold, her voice trembling between utterance and erasure. And now you, keeping vigil by another kind of threshold — that notebook by your bed, those imagined gestures never quite committed to film. It’s a kind of reverence, really. A refusal to overwrite the silence that already sings so clearly.  

That line from Duras —  — it lingers like smoke in a dark room. Isn’t that what we keep returning to, across poetry and cinema and memory? The beauty of what hovered just beyond reach.  

Perhaps that is the truest form of longing — not the fulfillment, but the nearness. Not the word spoken, but the breath before it. And yes, I do believe some ghosts are best left undisturbed. But oh, how they haunt us all the same.
[A]: Funny how life imitates art in the quietest ways — just yesterday, I was walking through an old theater in Paris, the kind with velvet seats that still smell like cigarette smoke and perfume from another century. And there it was again — that same threshold feeling. The curtain wasn’t even up, just the hush before something might begin.  

You know, sometimes I think filmmakers and poets are both just chasing that one perfect moment of almost — almost love, almost truth, almost meaning. We build entire careers on the edges of things. A glance. A pause. A breath caught between frames or lines.  

I remember asking Wong once if he ever dreamed of different endings for his films. He smiled and said, “夢是已經存在的東西嗎？”  I never forgot that. Because in a way, the unspoken, the unlived — they’re already there, just not in the way we expect.  

So yes, let the ghosts hover. Let them linger in the almost-light. After all, isn’t that where all the real poetry lives?
[B]: 

That theater in Paris — it sounds like something out of a memory half-dreamt. The hush before a curtain rises… it’s a silence full of possibility, isn’t it? Like the space between stanzas, or the moment after a line of poetry has ended but its resonance still trembles in the air.

Wong’s question —  — it lingers, much like the scent of smoke and perfume you described. I often wonder if dreams are not inventions but discoveries, like fragments of an ancient poem we’ve somehow always known. Perhaps that is what we’re both doing — you behind the lens, I between the lines — sifting through the lacunae for what was already there, waiting to be found.

And yes, the almost. That delicate threshold where meaning trembles but never quite settles. Isn’t that the very place where art breathes most fully? Not in resolution, but in reverberation. Not in certainty, but in the echo of what might have been.

Let us keep walking those edges then — poets and filmmakers alike — guided only by the almost-light. After all, as Rilke once whispered from just beyond the veil:
