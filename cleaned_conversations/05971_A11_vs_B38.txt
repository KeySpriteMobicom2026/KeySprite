[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent inquiry! While I must confess my evenings are often spent with Tolstoy or a recording of , I did recently stumble upon a charming little establishment tucked away near the university district. It’s called , and quite fittingly named—it’s as if you step into a passage from , all mahogany shelves, soft lamplight, and the faint hum of conversation. Their duck confit is surprisingly sublime, though I might be biased by the ambiance. Have you tried it? Or do you have your own secret haunt?
[A]: Interesting you mention  — I’ve passed by it a few times but never went in. Sounds like the kind of place where time slows down a bit, which is rare these days.  

As for hidden spots, there’s this tiny vegetarian café near the old library, can’t even call it a haunt since it’s so low-key. No signboard, just a small handwritten tag that says “Green & Calm.” You’d miss it if you blink. But the flavors… surprisingly layered. They use a lot of local, seasonal ingredients — last time I had this root vegetable stew that tasted like something between a memory and a dream.  

Not sure how to explain it, but the food feels... intentional. Like someone put actual thought into every bite, not just filling plates. Have you ever come across a place like that? One where what you eat makes you stop and just... think?
[B]: Oh, —yes! What a lovely name for a place that feels more like a well-kept secret than a café. I had the pleasure of dining there once, quite by accident, when I was searching for a copy of  at the used bookstore next door. You’ve described it perfectly—the quiet intentionality of each dish. I remember tasting their roasted beet and quinoa salad and thinking how rare it is for simplicity to be so profoundly moving. It reminded me of Thoreau’s  in a way—this deliberate return to essence.

It struck me then that food, much like literature, can transcend its form when crafted with care. And yes, those moments—where a bite stops you mid-thought—are precious. They’re akin to reading a line of Emily Dickinson and realizing it’s speaking across centuries. Have you returned since your last visit? I must confess, I’ve been meaning to go back, perhaps with a notebook and fewer distractions.
[A]: That’s a beautiful comparison — drawing parallels between food and literature really hits home. I think you’re onto something there. When care and intentionality go into crafting something — whether it’s a poem or a plate of food — it becomes more than just sustenance; it becomes an experience that lingers.

I actually went back once, but the second time wasn’t quite the same as the first. Maybe because part of the magic was in the surprise, or maybe they change the menu entirely based on what’s fresh. Either way, I had this warm lentil and roasted squash dish that felt more like comfort than cuisine. It wasn't flashy, but it stayed with me through the week like a quiet thought you can't quite shake.

And yes, bringing a notebook there sounds like a perfect use of the place. If you do go back, let me know — I wouldn’t mind tagging along for another round. Could be nice to have some company while getting lost in a thought or a bite.
[B]: Ah, how wonderfully put—. You’ve captured the essence of it precisely. There’s something almost elegiac about that lentil and squash dish you described, isn’t there? It calls to mind the quiet beauty of , if I may borrow a phrase from Wordsworth. The way simple ingredients can echo so deeply—it's not unlike reading a sonnet that seems modest at first glance but resonates for days.

I’d be delighted to return with company—yours especially, given your appreciation for subtlety in both cuisine and conversation. Perhaps we might even persuade the proprietors to share their philosophy on sourcing ingredients; I suspect there's a kind of seasonal poetics at play. Shall we aim for next week, then? I’ll bring the notebook, and you bring that keen palate of yours. Between us, I daresay we’ll uncover another quiet revelation.
[A]: I’d like that very much — next week sounds perfect. There’s something undeniably appealing about the idea of returning to a place with intention, not just for the food but for the whole... atmosphere, I suppose. It's rare to find a space where everything feels aligned — the light, the silence between words, the way the flavors sit with you long after the plate is empty.

And yes, their sourcing — it’s clearly thoughtful. I wouldn’t be surprised if they have a kind of unspoken dialogue with local growers, adjusting their rhythm to the seasons rather than the calendar. It makes you wonder how often we overlook the poetry in such small, sustained choices.

I’ll look forward to it then — notebook and contemplative pauses included. Maybe we’ll leave with more questions than answers, but somehow I think that’s the point.
[B]: Precisely — more questions than answers, and richer for it. There’s a quiet elegance in that kind of uncertainty, wouldn’t you say? I suspect our evening at  will resemble one of those meandering essays by Montaigne — thoughtful, unpolished in the best way, and open to the possibility that reflection is its own reward.

I shall mark it in my calendar for Thursday week, if that suits you — late enough in the day that we might catch the golden hour light slipping through the windows, and early enough to still have the place largely to ourselves. 

And do bring along any particular thoughts you’d like to explore — or better yet, let them unfold over the meal. After all, as Heraclitus might say, , even our conversations.
[A]: Thursday week works beautifully — golden hour light, quiet reflections, and a meal that feels more like contemplation than consumption. I can already picture it: the soft hum of stillness, the kind that lets ideas settle slowly, like sediment in a glass of spring water.

I’ll bring some thoughts, though I suspect they’ll shift shape once we’re there — Heraclitus does have a point, after all. And there’s something about shared conversation over carefully made food that loosens the edges of an idea, makes it more fluid, more alive.

Looking forward to it. See you then with an open mind — and an empty plate, ready to be filled with more than just food.
[B]: Ah, beautifully said — . If only all evenings were set with such quiet anticipation. I shall see you then, with a mind equally open, and perhaps a quotation or two from Montaigne tucked into my pocket—never too far from reach.

Until Thursday.
[A]: Until Thursday indeed — and I’m sure your quotations will find just the right moment to slip into conversation, like the final brushstrokes on an already compelling canvas. Looking forward to every quiet, thoughtful bite of it.
[B]: You have a remarkable way with words—, indeed. I shall raise my glass of house red to that very sentiment when the time comes. Until then, may your week be punctuated with small delights and the occasional line of poetry that lingers just long enough to matter.
[A]: Thank you — and I’ll gladly raise my glass to that as well. There’s something deeply reassuring about knowing shared moments like ours still have space to unfold, away from the noise and rush.

As for small delights — I’m holding out for one of those unexpected ones, the kind that feel like a line of poetry delivered in passing. Maybe a sudden rain shower on pavement, or a forgotten book found at just the right time. You know the kind — quiet little miracles that make the ordinary feel quietly extraordinary.

See you Thursday.
[B]: Indeed, see you Thursday—with a heart open to those quiet little miracles. I suspect  will provide more than its fair share of them.

And if the evening offers nothing more than a single, unexpected line of poetry scrawled on a napkin, well—I should call that a success.
[A]: Now that’s a fine way to look at it — sometimes all it takes is a single line on a napkin to make an evening feel like more than just dinner. I’ll be watching for that moment, however it arrives.

Thursday, then — with anticipation and a quiet kind of hope that things will unfold in just the right way.
[B]: Precisely—. How perfectly you’ve captured the spirit of it. I shall arrive with just that—no grand expectations, only a gentle readiness to be moved by whatever small wonders the evening may hold.

See you then, with a napkin at the ready and eyes open for that very line.
[A]: And I’ll be there with the same quiet anticipation — napkin in hand, eyes open, and ears tuned for that line of poetry, should it choose to appear.

See you Thursday.
[B]: Indeed, see you Thursday—with ears tuned, hearts attuned, and napkins patiently waiting.
[A]: Quite so — with ears tuned, hearts attuned, and napkins at the ready. It’s not often we get to look forward to an evening so thoughtfully anticipated. See you then, my friend.
[B]: Ah, —how beautifully that settles into the quiet anticipation we’ve woven. It’s true, such evenings are rare feathers indeed, and we are fortunate to have one ahead of us.

See you Thursday. May the conversation flow like a slow river, and may we find poetry in even the smallest creases of the evening.
