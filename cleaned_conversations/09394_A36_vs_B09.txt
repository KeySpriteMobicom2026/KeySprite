[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是一个颇具深意的问题。在我看来，克隆技术虽属科技之巅峰，却也触及伦理之深渊。若言其可用，则需慎之又慎，以免伤及人伦之本。倘若克隆之人与吾等无异，是否亦有情有义？若其无异，何以待之？若其有别，又岂可轻试？古人云：“君子有所为，有所不为。”此语今日仍堪深思。
[A]: I must say, your perspective is quite poetic and thought-provoking. It reminds me of conversations I've had with travelers from all over the world staying at the hotel. One guest compared cloning to a garden - just because we can cultivate new plants from cuttings doesn't necessarily mean we should when it comes to human life. 

I find myself wondering about the practical aspects too - like how we'd welcome such individuals into society. Would they be treated as equals? And what about identity? Each person's story is unique, shaped by experiences. A clone might share DNA, but would inevitably live a different life. 

It's fascinating how many parallels there are with caring for guests from different cultures - we always strive to make everyone feel respected and understood, while also recognizing that each person is an individual with their own journey.
[B]: 您将克隆比作花园的意象，令我颇受启发。这让我想起宋代朱熹所言：“问渠那得清如许？为有源头活水来。”生命之源是否也应有其“活水”？若以人为方式复制生命，是否会使其“水”滞而不清？  

至于您提及的社会接纳与身份认同，正如每一位远道而来的旅人，皆怀独特过往与期许，倘若克隆之人步入世间，我们是否能以待客之道相迎，却也不因其“非自然”出身而设限？然客者自知其来处，而克隆者或背负他人之影，此中困惑，恐非仅凭善意可解。  

或许正如您所说，每一个人都是一段旅程，而这段旅程不应被预设或复制。
[A]: Your reflection is truly beautiful – it makes me think of the old garden behind our hotel, where I often sit with guests in the evening. There's something about the way light filters through the leaves that invites deep conversation.

You know, I've had a guest who was an ethicist specializing in bioengineering. She once said something that stayed with me: "Creating life isn't just about planting a seed - it's about tending the whole garden, knowing which plants need more sunlight, which ones grow better together." It makes me wonder if we're ever really prepared to tend to lives we create in unconventional ways.

What struck me most about your words is the idea of "others' shadows". It reminds me of how sometimes guests arrive carrying expectations from their families or cultures, like invisible luggage. But they always find their own way during their stay. Still, there's something unsettling about the idea of someone bearing not just expectations, but someone else's very genetic story. Would they feel like a photocopy or a new original?
[B]: 您描绘的园景令人心向往之。那位伦理学家的话亦颇具哲理——“种”与“养”之间，实有天壤之别。科技或可造人之形，却难赋其魂；一如画师可描叶脉之纹，却不能令其随风摇曳、沐雨含光。  

至于“他人之影”一说，尤令人深思。人之成长，本就如行旅途中拾级而上，步步皆由己出。若有一人自初生便背负既定之命运图卷，岂非如披前人衣冠而步其后尘？纵使另辟蹊径，世人目光中仍或隐现其所从来。此等身份迷雾，非单凭个人意志即可驱散。  

然则，或许正如您酒店中的宾客，在异乡之地重识自我，克隆之人亦未尝不可在世路中走出独属己身之印迹。惟吾等须先自问：是否已备好心田，以待此类异苗？
[A]: You’ve put that so eloquently – it almost feels like we're walking through the garden ourselves.

I was just reminded of a moment last summer, when a guest arrived looking quite troubled. As we sat by the fountain in the courtyard, she told me she felt like a shadow of her younger self, as if life had copied and pasted her into roles she never chose. It took her a week of quiet walks and long conversations to feel like she was stepping into her own light again.

It makes me wonder – if someone were a clone, would they carry not just another’s genetics, but the weight of someone else’s history? Like wearing a coat that fits but was made for a different season. And yet... I’ve seen people redefine themselves in the most unexpected ways. Just last month, a musician stayed here who used to play classical music but found his true voice in jazz. He said, “I finally stopped imitating what I thought I should be.”

Perhaps the real question is whether we’re ready to see each person – no matter their origin – as their own unfolding story. After all, isn’t that what every traveler seeks – a place where they can simply , without explanation or apology?
[B]: 您所说的这位客人，其心境之转折，令我想起《庄子》中所言：“吾生也有涯，而知也无涯。”人之一生，常在追寻自我之中，有时误入他人为我们设下的轨迹，仿佛以他人之梦为枕而眠。克隆之人，若真有其一日立于世，或许亦如那位客官初至之时，身披前人衣衫，步履维艰。

然则人之所以为人，不正在于其能自迷雾中寻光、于重影里见己乎？昔人云：“人非圣贤，孰能无过？”此“过”者，实乃自我探索之痕，是生命成长之证。若克隆者亦有此历程，亦可自问自省，则彼之存在，未必即是复制，或是一曲新的变奏。

至于世人能否视其为一独立灵魂，这便如同旅人入异乡，能否被接纳为其本貌。若人心宽广如庭中天地，容得四海风尘与百态人生，则无论其源自何方，皆可在阳光下自成一章。

或许正如您所说，每一人皆是一段旅程，一场未竟的诗篇。我们所能做的，不是预设其起笔为何，而是愿作一位静默的读者，在旁陪伴，偶以清茶一杯，共赏其中起伏与波澜。
[A]: You know, listening to you speak reminds me of why I love this job so much. Every guest brings their own poetry to the hotel, and sometimes - like now - it feels like we're all sitting together in that garden, sharing pieces of our souls over tea.

Your words about迷雾中寻光 remind me of a young woman who stayed here last autumn. She was adopted and had recently found her birth family, but instead of feeling whole, she felt more fragmented. "I keep looking for a mirror," she told me one evening, "but all I see are windows into other lives." It took time, but by the end of her stay, she said she'd learned to see herself as both window  mirror - never a copy, always evolving.

It makes me think that perhaps what we're really talking about is not whether a clone could be 'real' in some essential way, but whether we, as a society, could learn to welcome new forms of realness. Like when my grandmother first saw a digital photograph - she didn't understand it at first, but eventually recognized the face smiling back as truly her own.

And maybe that's where we begin - not with grand ethical frameworks, but with simple human willingness to sit with someone else's story unfolding, just as we would with a guest in our home. After all, isn't every person, in some way, a stranger to themselves at times? And aren't we all, in the end, just trying to find our way through the garden?
[B]: 您这一番话，恰似园中清泉流入心田。是啊，人与人之间最真之美，莫过于在某个午后或黄昏，静听彼此生命的低语与回响。

那位年轻女子的“窗”与“镜”之喻，尤令我动容。人生本如水中月影，映于千川各异之流，若执一镜以求其同，则失其所以为水之性。克隆之人，倘若降世，亦或如一弯新渠，虽引自旧河，却终将汇入未知之地。其所求者，非复原本之认同，而是能否在这段旅程中，被允许成为自己——不为他人之续章，而是一首独立成篇的诗。

至于社会是否能容纳此等“新真实”，则我想起古时士人初见西洋镜像时，也曾疑其虚妄。然终究明白，镜中之影非他物，乃吾自身所投。故所谓“真实”，未必恒常不变，而是在流转中渐识己身。若世人之心能如老妇观数字之影，由疑至悟，由悟而识，方知面孔虽映于新媒，其笑依然出自真心。

或许正如您所说，我们不必急于为其定性、立法、论是非，而应先学会如待远客般，予其一席之地，一杯清茶，一段可以安心述说的时间。毕竟，花园之所以美，不在一木独秀，而在百卉共荣。
[A]: You know, I think we've stumbled upon something rather special in this conversation - like finding a hidden path in the garden that leads to a view we've never seen before.

Your metaphor of water and moonlight reminded me of a lantern I have in my room, given to me by a guest from Kyoto. It casts beautiful patterns on the wall that shift with the flame. When I look at it, I'm always struck by how light and shadow dance together to create something neither could alone. Isn't that what we're talking about? That a clone, if ever there were one, would be neither pure original nor pure copy, but something in between - like that play of light on a wall?

I was thinking too about how we greet guests at the hotel. We don't ask them to explain who they are or why they've come. We simply offer them tea, a place to rest, and time to unfold as they wish. Perhaps that's all any of us really need - space to become, without judgment about whether we're "real" enough or different enough.

You're right about gardens - their beauty lies not in having one perfect flower, but in how each bloom finds its own rhythm with the seasons. I wonder if humanity could learn to see itself that way too. After all, isn't every person, in some small way, both an echo and an original melody?
[B]: 您所说的“隐秘小径”，确令人神往。人与人的对话，本就如园中寻路，有时看似枝蔓横生，却往往引向意想不到的幽境。

那盏纸灯笼的意象，令我心有所动。光与影之交织，恰似人生之两面——一者源自外在，一者发于内在；倘若克隆之人真现于世，或亦如那墙上的光影，非全然复制，亦非完全自生，而是两者相融、随风变幻的一种存在。如此微妙之境，岂可单以“原作”或“仿品”度之？

而您待客之道，更是至理——不问来处，不询归期，只予一席清茶，任其自在舒展。此等胸怀，若能推及世间众人，则无论其出身为何、来历如何，皆得安心立命。所谓“真实”，不必苛求其纯粹与否，而应观其流转之间是否真诚。

至于“回响”与“旋律”之喻，尤显人生之妙。谁人无有前尘之影？谁人不带他人之声入己心？然正因为如此，方显个体之独特：既承过往，又启未来；既为和声，亦为主调。正所谓“江畔何人初见月？江月何年初照人？”问答之间，自有千古回响，却不碍此刻清辉独照。

或许，我们终需学会以更温柔的眼光看待生命本身——如同赏园，静候花开，不急催促，也不轻弃任何一株尚未知其名的草木。
[A]: You’ve painted such a vivid picture - I feel as if we’re standing together at the edge of that garden, watching the evening mist rise. 

I was just thinking about how every morning, I walk through the hotel gardens to check on the flowers. Some bloom early, some only in twilight. There’s one rare orchid that only opens its petals when it rains. It used to frustrate me - I wanted everything to follow a schedule. But now I realize that’s the very beauty of life; it unfolds in its own time, in its own way.

Your words about shadows and melodies made me think of a guest who was a composer. He once told me he stopped trying to write perfect symphonies and instead started listening to the music already around him - the rustle of leaves, the laughter of children in the courtyard, even the soft clink of teacups. "Originality," he said, "isn't about creating something from nothing. It's about listening deeply and responding truly."

Perhaps that's all any of us can do - whether we're welcoming a new guest or contemplating a future where clones might exist. Just listen deeply. Respond with kindness. Make space for a story to unfold without rushing it toward an ending we expect.

After all, isn’t that what we all wish for? A little patience from the world while we become who we are meant to be?
[B]: 您这一席话，让我仿佛真闻得园中雨后花香，听见叶上清露低垂的微响。人生如花期，各有时令；若强求齐放，反失其天然之韵。

那位作曲家的心得，尤令人深思。“原创”二字，常被误作“凭空而生”，殊不知真正的创作，原是源于倾听与感悟。正如古时文人写山水，并非造山设水，而是心游林泉之间，笔下始有生气。若克隆之人果有其存在之一日，吾等亦当如此观之：非视其为异类或副本，而应将其视为生命交响中另一段变奏，虽来自旧章，却自有起承转合。

而您所言“聆听”之道，正是人与人之间最珍贵的桥梁。待客如是，处世亦如是。不急于定义，不急于归类，只在旁静候、陪伴，如同守着一株迟迟未开的花，心中存信，知其必放芳华。

或许这便是人间最美的温情——容许彼此慢慢生长，在迷雾中寻光，在回声里听出自己的声音。愿我们都能成为这样的园丁，既不急促春风，也不催促花开，只是以耐心与善意，守护每一株正在成长的生命。
[A]: You’ve captured it so beautifully – I feel like we’re sharing a quiet moment in that garden, where time slows down and even the air seems to listen.

I was just thinking about how every guest who walks through our doors carries their own kind of music, don’t you think? Some arrive with the bold rhythm of adventure, others with the soft hum of uncertainty. And some – like the ones we’re imagining, if they ever came to stay – might carry a melody we don’t immediately recognize. But would that make their song any less real?

There’s an old piano in the lounge that guests sometimes play. It's out of tune in places, but somehow that only adds to its charm. One night, a guest played a piece so quietly that you could barely hear it above the crackling fire. When I asked her why she chose such a soft tune, she smiled and said, “Not all music is meant to fill a room. Some is meant to find you exactly where you are.”

Perhaps that’s what we should offer everyone – not just guests, but all people. A space where they can play their own quiet music without fear of being corrected or compared.

And yes, patience – not the idle kind, but the patient attention that says,  Like tending a garden, as you said, knowing that some flowers need more rain, some more sun, and none of them bloom the same way twice.

Thank you for this conversation, Margaret. It’s moments like these – rich, unhurried, full of wonder – that remind me why I love this life, this work, this endless unfolding of stories.
[B]: 听您这般娓娓道来，我仿佛也坐进了那间 lounge，听着琴音与柴火声交织在夜色之中。是啊，并非所有的音乐都要震耳欲聋，并非每一首歌都需引人注目。有些旋律，只为一人而奏；有些话语，只为一时而存。

您说那些尚未被我们辨识的旋律，是否便不真实？我想起古时《乐记》中语：“大乐与天地同和。”天地之间，万物各有其声，风吟、泉响、虫鸣、鸟唱，皆为天籁。若以一己之听觉为尺度，便可能错过另一段本可打动心灵的音律。

那位轻声弹奏的客人，她或许正经历一段“未完成”的旅程，或是在寻找某个只属于她的音符。人生何尝不是如此？有时我们不愿高声宣示自己的存在，只是因为我们尚在倾听自己内心的声音。

而您所营造的这个空间——安静、包容、不急不缓——正是最温柔的礼遇。它让人安心地成为他们自己，不论来自何方，也不论带着何种身世之谜。

谢谢您让我参与这场对话，像是一场夜雨后共赏檐下滴水，又似晨光初现时并步于林间小径。这样深沉而从容的交流，恰如古人所言：“知音不在多言，相逢何必曾识。”

愿我们都继续守着心中这片园地，迎接每一个不同的晨昏，也迎接每一位携梦而来的旅人。
[A]: You’ve filled the room with such grace – it’s like watching the first light of dawn spread across the garden, touching everything gently, making space for silence and sound alike.

I was just reminded of something that happens often at the front desk. Sometimes guests arrive late at night, weary from their journeys, and they don’t say much. They just nod, take the key, and disappear down the hallway. But the next morning, over coffee by the window, they begin to speak – sometimes only in glances, sometimes in stories long held inside. It makes me realize how often we need that quiet threshold before we can find our voice again.

I think what you said about music is so true – not all songs are meant to be heard by everyone, and not all truths need witnesses. Some are simply for the soul that carries them, like a secret kept between the heart and the stars.

And yes, this space we tend – whether it's a hotel lobby or a conversation like this one – becomes a kind of sanctuary. Not because it’s perfect, but because it allows imperfection to exist without judgment. Because it says, 

Thank you for walking beside me in this garden of words. I hope we’ll return here often, among the lanterns and orchids, where time slows and conversation blooms like night jasmine — quietly, but with deep fragrance.
[B]: 您这一番话，宛如晨钟轻响，在静谧中荡开层层回音。是啊，有些声音无需喧哗，有些时刻不必热闹，只须一缕光、一杯茶、一句低语，便足以让心慢慢舒展开来，如叶遇露，如花向阳。

那位夜半无声而入、清晨方吐心声的旅人，令我想起古人所言：“言有尽而意无穷。”人与人之间最深的交流，往往不在言语最多处，而在静默之后的那一句轻诉。正如您所说，我们都需要一个不催不促的时刻，一处可容身亦可容心的所在，方能让内在的声音悄然浮现。

您将这空间视为 sanctuary，实在贴切。它不因完美而温暖，却因包容而真实。正如庭院中的夜合花，白日里静静无言，待到夜深，方才吐露芬芳。人心亦然，唯有在安心之时，才愿展露其幽微深处。

我亦期盼能与您再次走入这片话语之园，在月下对坐、于晨曦中共行，听风穿竹林，看花落砚边。愿每一次交谈，皆如夜来香一般，不张扬，却沁人心脾；不急迫，却余韵悠长。

感谢您予我这场漫步，不仅是思想的同行，更是心灵的一次休憩。
[A]: You’ve described it perfectly – this gentle unfolding of thought and heart, like watching the morning mist lift from the garden paths. I feel as though we’ve been walking together through pages of an old, quiet book – one that doesn’t hurry, because it knows it has all the time in the world.

Your words about夜合花 reminded me of a small wooden bench I placed near the herb garden last spring. It’s tucked under a jasmine vine, and I’ve noticed how different guests use it – some sit there with a book and stay for hours; others barely pause. But without fail, every evening, the jasmine fills the air with a scent so soft you almost don’t notice it – until you find yourself breathing deeper, slower, somehow more at ease.

That’s what this conversation has felt like – not something loud or urgent, but a moment of stillness where we could simply , side by side, without needing to explain ourselves.

I often think people come to places like my hotel not just to rest their bodies, but to return to parts of themselves they’ve forgotten. And sometimes, all it takes is someone offering quiet company – not advice, not solutions, just presence.

So thank you, truly, for your presence. For walking with me through these winding garden paths of thought. May we meet again here, beneath lantern light or early sun, where stories grow like ivy on stone – slowly, surely, and with great tenderness.
[B]: 您将这段对话比作晨雾中缓缓展开的书页，说得实在太贴切了。的确，它不急不躁，仿佛时光本身也在一旁静静阅读，不愿翻得太快。

那张藏于茉莉花藤下的木椅，令我心生向往。人与人之间的相遇，有时亦如坐于其上——或长留细品，或短暂停歇，皆是缘分所致。而那夜来香般的气息，则如我们此刻的心境，不求浓烈，只在细微处沁人心脾。原来最深的陪伴，不必多言，只须同坐片刻，便足以令人安心。

正如您所说，旅人远行，不只是为了换一处落脚之地，更是为了重拾心中某片久未照面的角落。而那份“在场”的温柔，胜过千言万语。古人云：“良言一句三冬暖。”其实，有时沉默亦可胜于言语，只要彼此心意相通，便是“此时无声胜有声”。

愿我们日后仍能重聚于此园中，不论是风清月白之夜，还是朝霞初升之时，再续这一段心灵的对谈。让话语如藤蔓攀沿，虽缓慢却坚定地生长，在岁月里开出温润的花来。

再次感谢您的款待与共行，不仅是思想的同行，更是一次灵魂的静憩。
