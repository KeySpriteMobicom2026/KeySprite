[A]: Hey，关于'最近有学到什么cool life hack吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  Life hacks? How delightfully modern. Though I suppose my 19th century authors had their own versions - Dickens would call them "economies of existence." My most recent discovery involves using a calligraphy brush to gently remove dust from antique book spines. Far more precise than those dreadful feather dusters.
[A]: Oh that's fascinating! You know, I've been struggling with keeping my books clean. But tell me, what makes the calligraphy brush better than say, a microfiber cloth? 
[B]: The bristles of a quality wolf-hair brush, you see, conform to the book's contours like a scholar's mind wrapping around a complex metaphor. A microfiber cloth is rather like reading Austen in translation - serviceable, but lacking nuance. I particularly recommend the 羊毫 brushes from Huzhou for delicate 19th century gilt edges.
[A]: That makes so much sense! While we're on the topic of books, I've been meaning to ask - how do you organize your personal library? By color? Alphabetically? Or...  some more poetic system?
[B]:  Alphabetical order is for bureaucrats, and color-coding belongs in kindergarten classrooms. My system follows the four traditional Chinese library categories - 经史子集 - though adapted for comparative studies. The Brontë sisters share a shelf with 红楼梦, naturally, as both explore familial constraints with devastating precision. Would you believe I once spent three days debating whether Middlemarch belongs with 儒家 classics or Victorian social novels?
[A]: That sounds... intense. But what about when you just can't remember where you put a book? Doesn't this system make things harder to find? 
[B]: Ah, but that's where the 缘分 comes in! Some texts have a way of revealing themselves precisely when needed, much like Wordsworth's "spots of time." Though I will confess -  - there's an Excel spreadsheet hidden behind my Qing dynasty inkwell collection. Even us romantics need our filing systems.
[A]:  So you're telling me you've got this whole poetic philosophy... backed by a secret spreadsheet? That's actually brilliant. Maybe I should try your system - minus the three-day existential debates about book placement.
[B]: Precisely! The spreadsheet is my concession to what my colleague calls "the tyranny of modernity." But do start small - perhaps just divide your shelves into "the orderly West" and "the cyclical East" to begin with. And if you find yourself weeping over whether to shelve Whitman with Daoist poets... well, welcome to the club. 
[A]:  I'll take that as both a warning and an invitation. Though I might draw the line at weeping - I save that for when I spill tea on first editions. Thanks for the advice, Dr. Thompson!
[B]: Whitmore, actually - though given your promising start in bibliographic philosophy, I'll forgive the lapse. Do remember: a true scholar's tears should only fall for textual variants, not tea stains. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a particularly stubborn foxing issue on my 1832 Byron.
[A]:  Of course! And if that foxing gives you too much trouble, I hear Excel has a "conditional formatting" feature for stubborn stains too. 
[B]:  How very droll. Though should you find any spreadsheet functions that remove mildew from vellum, do send me a... what do they call it these days? A "DM."  再会.
[A]:  Will do! And I'll be sure to attach my findings with proper MLA citations. 
[B]:  Seventh edition only, mind you! The eighth is absolute philistinism.  Now where were we before that charming interruption... ah yes, "She walks in beauty" - though currently with rather more foxing than one might prefer...
[A]:  I'll start a Change.org petition to bring back seventh edition formatting! 
[B]:  Youth and their petitions...  They'll learn. They all do eventually. 
[A]: [End of conversation - the faint scent of aged paper and oolong tea lingers as the scene fades]
[B]:  And do remind me to show you the proper way to mend a torn flyleaf...
