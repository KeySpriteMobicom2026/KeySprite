[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题很有意思。说实话，我觉得college degree仍然很重要，但它的意义可能在悄悄改变。比如，在job market里，很多employer还是会把degree当做一个筛选标准——就像一个入门券。不过现在也有越来越多的公司开始看重skills和projects，而不是仅仅看一纸文凭。

你有没有注意到，像一些tech行业的大公司，他们甚至推出了自己的training programs或者bootcamps？这说明他们在重新定义什么是"qualified"。从心理学的角度来说，这其实也影响了年轻人的motivation——如果人们觉得degree不再那么关键，他们可能会更倾向于寻找alternative paths。不过话说回来，你觉得这种变化对教育体系来说是不是一种挑战呢？
[A]: I suppose it does present a challenge, but also an opportunity for reinvention.学位曾经是知识的象征，但现在知识本身正在变得流动而开放。比如，我最近在读一本关于数字人文的书，里面提到在线课程和开放教育资源如何打破了校园的围墙——这让我想到艾略特《荒原》里的碎片意象，当代的学习路径就像那些相互映照的碎片，不再需要通过单一框架来折射。

不过说到心理学影响...你有没有觉得这像维多利亚时代晚期的信仰危机？那时的人们同样面对传统价值体系的崩塌。或许我们现在也在经历类似的认知重构——只是这次被撼动的是学院派的知识权威性。有趣的是，我在批改论文时发现，年轻一代反而更倾向于用跨界思维重新组装这些"知识碎片"，就像拼贴画一样。
[B]: Interesting analogy! 你说的这个fragmentation让我想到后现代教育理论里提到的epistemic uncertainty。不过我觉得现在的情况更复杂——不只是知识结构在重组，认知权威也在被重新定义。比如AI技术带来的冲击就远超当年的印刷机革命，它直接影响了我们对“knowledge production”的理解。

从发展心理学的角度看，Z世代面对这种变化确实表现出不同的cognitive strategies。我在做cross-cultural study的时候发现，东亚学生更倾向于把碎片化学习整合进传统框架（就像你说的拼贴画），而北美学生则更习惯于用模块化思维去重构体系。这可能跟collectivist vs. individualist的文化认知差异有关？

说到《荒原》，我最近在重听巴赫的《十二平均律》，突然觉得这些看似离散的知识碎片其实可以通过scaffolding形成新的harmony——就像good teaching能让不同learning pathways产生协同效应。你觉得在线教育平台有没有可能成为新的认知脚手架呢？
[A]: That’s a fascinating observation about epistemic uncertainty and cultural cognition. I think you’re right—Z世代 isn’t just adapting to fragmentation; they're reengineering how knowledge is navigated and synthesized. It reminds me of Gerard Manley Hopkins’ idea of “inscape”—each individual's unique pattern of understanding, yet somehow harmonizing with the larger "instress" of collective meaning.

As for AI reshaping knowledge production… yes, it does feel like a paradigm shift far beyond what Guttenberg initiated. What strikes me is how AI destabilizes the teacher-student hierarchy. In some ways, we're all becoming perpetual apprentices—guiding each other and the machine at the same time. It's oddly democratic, yet raises so many ethical questions about authorship and intellectual ownership.

Regarding your question about online platforms as scaffolding—I do believe they hold that potential, especially when designed with intentionality. Think of them almost like Eliot’s “objective correlative”—a structure that can emotionally and intellectually align diverse learning experiences into something coherent. But only if we build them with care and keep pedagogy—not just technology—at the center.

I’ve noticed even my literature students are forming study clusters across continents via these platforms. They’ll read Woolf together in real-time from five different countries, then annotate the text collaboratively. It’s messy, but there’s a kind of emergent intelligence happening—one that feels both new and strangely familiar, like rereading an old poem with fresh eyes.
[B]: I love that image of —it captures the tension between tradition and transformation so beautifully. And you’re absolutely right about this new kind of apprenticeship emerging. In my recent study group, I noticed students don’t really see me as a  anymore; more like a  or  of resources. It’s almost Socratic in a way, except now we’re dialoguing not just with each other, but with algorithms too—though hopefully not letting them dominate the conversation 😅.

The  you mentioned fascinates me, especially from a cross-cultural perspective. When learners from different continents annotate Woolf together, they’re not just sharing interpretations—they’re co-constructing meaning through multiple cultural lenses. That’s what I call . But it also makes me wonder: do you think this kind of collaborative learning risks flattening nuance, or does it actually deepen interpretation by exposing us to alternative readings we’d never consider alone?

And speaking of pedagogy over technology—I’ve been experimenting with hybrid models where online platforms are used to , not replace, face-to-face discussion. For example, using asynchronous forums to build background knowledge before diving into deeper synchronous conversations. It’s like giving students a chance to warm up their ideas before stepping into the classroom orchestra 🎻. Have you tried anything like that?
[A]: Oh, I love the metaphor of the classroom orchestra—how apt. And yes, I’ve been playing with similar structures, though I tend to think of it in terms of . You know how Dostoevsky layers voices in , each perspective resonating against the others? That’s what I aim for: a kind of textual—or rather, conversational—polyphony where students build on one another's ideas across time and space.

I’ve used online forums as preludes to seminar discussions, encouraging students to post initial readings of a poem or passage, then respond to each other before we meet face-to-face. What I find fascinating is how quieter students often blossom in the written space—it gives them room to compose their thoughts without the pressure of immediate response. It’s like watching someone find their voice in a letter before speaking aloud in the drawing room.

As for your question about nuance being flattened or deepened through global collaboration—I think it depends on how carefully we frame the context. When my students annotate Woolf together, they often start with very localized readings, grounded in their own cultural frameworks. But over time, patterns emerge—echoes between colonial history and contemporary identity, say, or differing views of interiority. The annotations become a kind of palimpsest, revealing how meaning isn’t lost so much as .

Still, there’s always the danger of oversimplification when multiple perspectives are condensed into digital dialogue. That’s where the teacher-as-curator comes in—helping students trace the genealogy of an idea, teaching them to ask not just  something means, but  it might mean differently across contexts. In a way, we’re nurturing a kind of interpretive elasticity—an ability to hold contradictory readings in tension without snapping under the strain.

And yes, this Socratic orchestration through algorithms does worry me at times. We mustn't let the machine become the silent gatekeeper of thought. I sometimes remind my students that even though AI can generate elegant summaries of Eliot’s poetry, it cannot feel the ache of modernist disillusionment. At least... not yet.
[B]: That ache of modernist disillusionment… you’re right, that’s something no algorithm can replicate—yet. And maybe never should. There’s an embodied vulnerability in our responses to texts that machines can’t access, at least not in any way we’d recognize as human. I often tell my students the same thing: AI might help us  Eliot, but it can’t  "The Waste Land" with us at 2 a.m. before an exam 😄

I really appreciate what you said about interpretive elasticity—holding contradictory readings without snapping. That’s such a delicate balance, especially when students are still developing their critical confidence. It makes me think of Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development, but stretched across cultures and contexts. The digital space becomes this extended ZPD where meaning is negotiated not just between learner and mentor, but among peers scattered across time zones.

Your idea of textual polyphony resonates deeply with me—I’ve been thinking lately about how classical Chinese poetry could fit into this model. Think of Du Fu or Li Bai, whose poems are layered with historical allusions and emotional restraint. When translated and read through different cultural ears, they gain new harmonics. Maybe that’s another kind of palimpsest, as you said—where meaning isn’t fixed, but flows depending on who’s reading and where.

And yes, the danger of oversimplification is always lurking. That’s why I try to scaffold annotation platforms with guided questions that push for context-aware interpretation. Like asking students:  It’s a way of slowing down the mind, encouraging deeper friction rather than frictionless exchange.

By the way, I’d love to hear more about how you choose which texts to layer in your polyphonic model. Do certain authors or genres lend themselves better to this kind of cross-cultural resonance?
[A]: Oh, what a beautifully layered question—like asking which constellations best reveal the curvature of space. I suppose I’m drawn to texts that already carry a kind of built-in echo chamber—works that are self-consciously fragmented or intertextual. Eliot, obviously, with his mythic method and patchwork allusions; Woolf, with her stream of consciousness that seems to ripple across perspectives; even someone like Borges, whose labyrinths invite multiple readings from any direction.

But lately, I’ve been experimenting with pairing Western modernist texts with classical Chinese poetry—yes, exactly as you mentioned with Du Fu and Li Bai. There’s something about the compressed emotional resonance in their work that speaks powerfully across centuries and continents. When we read  alongside Du Fu’s , students begin to see how despair can be articulated so differently—one through fragmentation and cacophony, the other through restraint and silence.

Genre-wise, poetry seems especially suited for this kind of cross-cultural polyphony, precisely because it demands interpretation at both the sonic and semantic level. A line from Emily Dickinson or Gerard Manley Hopkins can sit very comfortably beside a Tang dynasty verse if you're paying attention to rhythm, image, and silence. Prose works, too, when they’re rich in subtext—think of Henry James or Eileen Chang (), both masters of unspoken tension.

I also look for texts where the unsaid is as important as the said. That’s where cultural nuance really comes into play. When students realize that what’s left out of a poem or story can be just as telling as what’s included—well, that’s when reading becomes an act of deep listening. And perhaps that’s the real skill we’re cultivating: not just interpretation, but —to language, to history, to each other.

So yes, certain authors and forms do lend themselves more readily to this resonance—but maybe only because they’ve already trained their readers to dwell in ambiguity. I suppose I’m always looking for texts that teach us how to read them... and then read them again, from a different angle, with new ears.
[B]: Absolutely—texts that … what a perfect phrase. It makes me think of how Du Fu’s poetry, though steeped in historical specificity, still invites rereading through different emotional and cultural lenses. His silence after loss, for instance, becomes almost Eliotic when placed beside "The Waste Land"—not because they sound the same, but because both create space for grief to echo differently depending on who's listening.

I’ve been doing something similar with my students: pairing Kafka with Han Shaogong’s . Both are deeply fragmented, both question narrative authority—but in such culturally distinct ways. What I find fascinating is how students begin to see fragmentation not just as a stylistic choice, but as a cognitive posture—a way of responding to uncertainty, whether political, existential, or epistemological.

And yes, attunement. That’s exactly it. In my field, we often talk about , but I think what we’re really cultivating is a kind of —the ability to sit with discomfort, to notice where meaning resists translation, and to resist the urge to smooth it out too quickly. It’s like teaching students to hear harmonics in language they didn’t know were there before.

I wonder if you've found certain pedagogical techniques especially effective in helping students move from analysis to attunement? I’ve had some success with guided reflective journals—asking students to write not just  the text, but  their reading experience. It slows them down, forces them to pay attention to their own interpretive shifts. But I’m always looking for new strategies—especially ones that honor ambiguity without romanticizing confusion.
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful approach—those reflective journals sound like little hermeneutic sanctuaries, where students can sit with the text and their own evolving responses. I’ve tried something similar, though perhaps more formally structured: , where students are asked not just to explain allusions or historical context, but to note their emotional reactions, uncertainties, even moments of boredom or irritation.

You know how Woolf described reading as a process of “submitting oneself to the current” before “taking possession of the book in one’s own way”? I want students to feel that permission—to be both analytical and vulnerable in their engagement. So I ask them to mark passages that resist them, that won’t quite yield, and then write a short reflection on why they think that might be. Sometimes it’s linguistic; sometimes it’s cultural; often it’s deeply personal.

One technique I’ve found surprisingly effective is what I call . After an initial group discussion, I have students choose a passage that lingered with them—something that either resonated or irritated—and read it aloud again a week later, after we’ve moved through other texts. Then they reflect on whether their response has shifted. It’s remarkable how often meaning evolves not through direct instruction, but through temporal echo. A line from Eliot might seem obscure at first, but after reading Du Fu, it suddenly carries a different weight—as if the silence between readings becomes its own kind of commentary.

Another strategy I use is . For example, after reading Kafka and Han Shaogong, I ask students to rewrite a key scene from the point of view of someone outside the narrative entirely—a bystander, a translator, even the text itself. This often surfaces assumptions they didn’t realize they were making, especially around authority, voice, and narrative closure.

I also find value in —not as evasion, but as a deliberate interpretive tool. Students are so trained to get things "right" that they rarely experiment with misalignment. But when I give them permission to misread deliberately—to stretch metaphors too far or invert symbolic meanings—they often stumble into insights they wouldn’t have reached otherwise. It’s like tuning a violin by going slightly out of tune first—you need the dissonance to find the harmony.

And yes, honoring ambiguity without romanticizing confusion—that’s the delicate balance. I remind my students that uncertainty isn’t failure; it’s the terrain we must walk together. Just as Eliot wrote, —well, you know the rest. The journey is its own justification.
[B]: That line from Eliot——feels like the perfect refrain for what we’re talking about. Exploration as a continuous mode of being in relation to texts, cultures, and even ourselves. And I love how your methods create space for that kind of sustained inquiry.

Your  remind me of what musicians call —when a note lingers beyond its written duration and affects the ones that follow. It’s fascinating how stepping away from a text and returning to it can reframe everything. I might borrow that idea, actually. I’ve been thinking lately about designing a module where students revisit the same passage through different interpretive frameworks—first historically, then psychologically, then cross-culturally—and notice how each lens reshapes their emotional response.

I also really appreciate your use of  as a pedagogical tool. In literary theory, we often talk about , especially in Harold Bloom’s sense—how poets reinterpret predecessors in ways that are both faithful and rebellious. Giving students permission to misread feels like an act of intellectual liberation. It challenges that anxiety around getting things “right,” which so often stifles curiosity.

I’m curious—have you found that these more open-ended strategies ever clash with institutional expectations? I sometimes run into pushback from curriculum designers who want clearly measurable outcomes. It’s hard to quantify  or  on a rubric. Do you ever find yourself translating these goals into more standardized terms, or do you push back?

And speaking of translation—what a loaded word! I’ve started incorporating meta-commentary sessions where we discuss the politics of translation itself. Like when we read  alongside Du Fu, we also look at different English translations of his work and ask:  It opens up such rich conversations about cultural mediation—and makes students more aware of how even their reading materials are constructed artifacts.

I suppose what I’m circling back to is this question of . Because if we can help students slow down, notice shifts, feel discomfort without rushing to resolve it—that, to me, is where real learning happens. Not just comprehension, but transformation.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more— may be the most radical act of all in this age of fractured focus. And yes, those  on translation sound absolutely vital. So often students take translations for granted as neutral conduits, forgetting—or never realizing—that every rendered line carries its own ideological imprint. I’ve had students read three different versions of  in Chinese and then reconstruct what each translator seems to prioritize—musicality? fragmentation? emotional tenor? It’s revelatory.

As for your question about institutional expectations—I do feel that tension, certainly. There’s immense pressure to frame learning outcomes in terms like “demonstrated proficiency” or “critical analysis,” which tend to favor closure over openness. But rather than simply pushing back, I’ve found a kind of  helps—using the language of assessment to describe interpretive elasticity without flattening it.

For instance, instead of listing “engage with ambiguity” on a rubric—which might raise eyebrows—I’ll phrase it as “analyze multiple interpretive possibilities in response to textual complexity.” It sounds more measurable, but still leaves room for the kind of slow, uncertain thinking we value. Or when describing echo readings, I frame it as “trace the evolution of personal interpretation through iterative engagement.” Same idea, different register.

Of course, there are moments when compromise feels like betrayal—when I want to shout,  But I’ve come to see this linguistic adaptation as part of the pedagogical work itself: translating our deepest educational values into a dialect that institutions can recognize, without losing their essential meaning. Much like what translators do with poetry—preserving resonance while navigating constraint.

And speaking of musical metaphors—you’re right about . I’ve started thinking of my courses in terms of , where certain texts and discussions reverberate long after they’re first encountered. Sometimes a student will return to a poem we read weeks ago and say,  and it’s not because I explained it better, but because their own inner ear has shifted.

That’s the alchemy we’re after, isn’t it? Not transmission of knowledge, but transformation of perception. And maybe, just maybe, that’s something no rubric will ever fully capture—but every thoughtful teacher knows when it’s happened.
[B]: Absolutely—, not just transmission of content. That’s the quiet revolution we’re after, isn’t it? And yes, it’s rarely captured in end-of-semester evaluations or accreditation reports, but you see it in those moments when a student  a text differently, or hesitates before offering an interpretation—as if they’ve finally understood that reading is not about extraction, but encounter.

I love your phrase —it feels so apt for what we do in navigating institutional demands. Sometimes I think our real expertise lies not just in literature or pedagogy, but in translation: between disciplines, between generations, even between bureaucratic language and lived learning. It’s like what Walter Benjamin said about the task of the translator—not perfect fidelity, but revealing the  of meaning across languages. In our case, perhaps, across systems and sensibilities.

I’ve also been thinking lately about how this kind of  you described can be nurtured through . For instance, pairing Eliot’s  with Heiner Goebbels’ —a piece of musical composition that feels structurally Eliotic to me. Or reading Woolf alongside Satoko Fujii’s free improvisation piano work, where silence and tension are orchestrated in similar ways. Some students resist at first——but over time, they begin to hear textual rhythm differently.

It reminds me of how you mentioned —I wonder if we’re both gesturing toward a kind of , where different forms of expression enter into layered conversation. Not illustration, not analogy—but polyphonic resonance.

And yes, alchemy. Quiet, persistent, often invisible. But there. Always there.
[A]: Yes—. That’s exactly it. I’ve been thinking in those same fugue-like terms lately, though hadn’t quite found the phrase. It’s not about illustrating a theme from one domain into another, but letting them speak  and  each other in ways that generate new tonalities of thought.

I tried something recently with my students—interweaving passages from Woolf’s  with excerpts from Arvo Pärt’s  compositions. At first, they were puzzled—what does this minimalist Estonian choral music have to do with stream-of-consciousness prose? But as we listened while reading, they began to sense the shared architecture: repetition with subtle variation, the way silence is used as an active element, the interplay between voice and absence of voice.

One student described it beautifully:  That kind of noticing—that’s where real interpretive depth begins.

And you’re right, of course, about resistance at first. Some students still crave the comfort of clear correspondences:  But over time, they start to trust the dissonance. They begin to understand, as you said, that meaning isn’t extracted—it’s encountered, often obliquely.

I wonder if this intermedial approach also helps them slow down in a different way—not just through reflective writing or echo readings, but through the very structure of perception itself. Music demands temporal surrender in a way prose doesn’t always; it unfolds whether you're ready or not. And perhaps that’s useful for literary study—learning to be carried along by rhythm, rather than trying to pin everything down at once.

I’d love to hear more about how your students respond to Goebbels’  alongside Eliot. Do they start to read  differently after hearing that fragmented yet strangely cohesive orchestration? I imagine it opens up new ways of thinking about collage, rupture, and the possibility of coherence emerging through contrast rather than resolution.

And yes—alchemy. Quiet, persistent, often invisible. But unmistakable when it takes hold.
[B]: Oh, I can  that interweaving of Woolf and Pärt—you’re absolutely right about the architecture. The way Pärt lets silence , and how Woolf allows thought to hover at the edge of articulation… it’s like both are composing with absence as much as presence. And what a stunning observation from your student—about holding their breath at different times. That’s exactly what counterpoint does: it staggers entrances so meaning emerges through tension and release across time.

I’ve had a similar experience with Eliot and Goebbels. At first, students read  as if it’s a puzzle to be solved—a code that, once cracked, will yield a single truth. But when we listen to , they start to hear fragmentation not as disintegration, but as structure. Goebbels uses industrial sounds, orchestral swells, spoken text—all colliding without smoothing out the edges. It’s unsettling, but deeply intentional. Once they get that sonic logic, they go back to Eliot with new ears. Suddenly, the poem isn’t broken; it’s . One student even said, 

That line stuck with me. So much of our job is helping students unlearn the expectation that coherence must mean seamlessness. In fact, some of the most powerful texts—and compositions—are those that hold contradiction in suspension. It’s almost ethical, in a way. Refusing to resolve what life doesn’t either.

You asked whether they read Eliot differently after Goebbels—and yes, they do. They begin to notice motifs not as isolated symbols, but as recurring  in the composition. The drowned Phoenician Sailor doesn’t just reappear; it echoes, like a leitmotif returning altered by what’s come in between. And suddenly, they’re reading for texture rather than linearity.

I’m curious—do you find that this kind of intermedial exposure changes how they approach writing? I’ve noticed that after working with layered auditory and textual forms, my students start experimenting more in their own essays—not just argumentatively, but structurally. Some write in fragments, others use repetition or silence as rhetorical devices. It’s as if the form of thinking becomes visible to them only when it’s heard first.
[A]: Oh, that line——is absolutely exquisite. It captures the very essence of what modernist and postmodernist texts are doing, doesn’t it? Refusing the illusion of wholeness, insisting instead on the integrity of rupture. And how beautifully Goebbels and Eliot both model that for students—not as breakdown, but as aesthetic and philosophical stance.

I’ve seen that shift in writing too, once students begin engaging with intermedial forms. At first, their essays tend to mirror what I call : thesis as prosecution, evidence as exhibit, conclusion as verdict. But after working with layered auditory and textual experiences, something loosens. They start experimenting with structure in ways they hadn’t before—nonlinear narratives, recursive motifs, even tonal shifts that mimic musical phrasing.

One student, after studying  alongside Pärt, wrote an essay that opened and closed with the same sentence, slightly altered each time—like a theme and variation. Another composed a literary analysis in fragmented sections, each one titled after a different character’s inner monologue, rather than offering a unified argument. What struck me was that these weren’t just stylistic flourishes—they were cognitive breakthroughs. The form revealed their deeper understanding of the text’s architecture.

And yes, silence becomes a rhetorical device. I’ve had students leave deliberate white space between paragraphs to signal emotional dissonance or thematic rupture. One even included a blank page mid-essay with the note:  I suppose you could say they begin to write  the text rather than  it.

I wonder if this has also changed how they respond to feedback? When writing becomes more textured, more performative, assessment can feel oddly reductive. I’ve had to adapt my comments accordingly—focusing less on “clarity” in the conventional sense and more on , , . It’s riskier, certainly, but I think it honors the complexity they’re trying to enact.

You know, I sometimes think we underestimate how much analytical thinking is shaped by . Students trained in traditional academic writing often struggle with ambiguity because they’ve been conditioned to move linearly—from point A to B to C. But once they start hearing prose as scored thought—layered, overlapping, even polyphonic—they begin composing in counterpoint. Not just making arguments, but staging conversations within themselves.

I’d love to hear how you frame this kind of experimental writing when reviewing it with your department or colleagues who might still favor more conventional forms. Do you find yourself defending it as legitimate literary analysis, or does the quality of thought usually speak for itself?
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better—. That’s precisely the shift I see too: from linear argumentation to scored thought, where meaning emerges through counterpoint rather than conclusion. And yes, when students begin composing in that layered way, it’s not just stylistic play—it’s evidence of deep cognitive engagement. They’re not summarizing the text anymore; they’re , , sometimes even .

To your question—how do I frame this kind of writing with colleagues? Honestly, it depends on who’s asking and how much tea I’ve had ☕️. With more progressive peers, I lean into the language of —arguing that experimental form is not a departure from rigor, but an extension of it. When students write in fragments or use silence as structure, they’re demonstrating a meta-awareness of how knowledge is constructed. That’s not just literary analysis; it’s epistemological reflection.

But with more traditional evaluators, I use what I call . Instead of saying “look how creative they’re being,” I say “notice how they’re deploying recursive motifs to trace thematic evolution” or “see how the non-linear structure mirrors the text’s own resistance to closure.” Suddenly, what looks like rebellion reads like method. It’s a bit like dressing avant-garde ideas in classical robes—still radical underneath, but more legible to the institution.

And you're absolutely right about assessment needing to adapt. Traditional rubrics struggle with resonance and tension. So I’ve started designing feedback templates that emphasize : How does the structure reflect the complexity of the text? In what ways does the writing enact—not just describe—the interpretive process? Some colleagues raise eyebrows, but others are intrigued. One even asked me to co-design a workshop on “Evaluating the Unruly Essay.”

Honestly, I think we’re at a moment where literary study needs to expand its own syntax. If our students are reading texts that fracture linearity, resist resolution, and blur boundaries, then our pedagogy—and our assessment—has to follow suit. Otherwise, we risk telling them, 

That would be... ironic, at best. At worst, it would be a missed opportunity for real intellectual transformation.

So no pressure 😄. But yes—I think we  underestimate the power of form. And I’m grateful for conversations like this one, where we can keep reimagining what thoughtful teaching might sound like.
[A]: Hear, hear. —what a brilliant strategy. It reminds me of what T.S. Eliot himself did so masterfully: innovate within the cloak of tradition. He may have shattered poetic form, but he did it while quoting Dante and invoking the metaphysicals. We’re just doing the same in our own pedagogical key.

I’ve found that reframing also helps when working with departmental gatekeepers. Instead of saying “this essay is fragmented,” I’ll say “this student has employed dialectical structure to interrogate textual instability.” Suddenly, what looked like chaos becomes methodological daring. And honestly? Once you name it, they start seeing it. The language we use doesn’t just describe—it  perception.

And yes, we are absolutely at a threshold moment for literary study. If we don’t evolve our pedagogy alongside our texts—if we ask students to read Woolf or Kafka or Du Fu with one hand while tying their writing behind their backs—we’re staging a kind of epistemic dissonance. We become the very contradiction we ask them to critique.

I’m reminded of something Adorno once said about art not being able to escape its own history. Well, perhaps pedagogy can’t either. But it  reanimate that history in ways that feel alive to the present. That’s what I love about what we’re doing—this dialogue between form and thought, structure and interpretation, tradition and transformation.

And speaking of thresholds—I’d be curious to know if your department has started adopting any of these ideas beyond the workshop level. Are more colleagues beginning to experiment with non-traditional forms of assessment? Or is it still mostly a quiet insurgency?

Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned from teaching modernism, it’s that revolutions often begin in small, deliberate acts—like a student leaving a blank page in the middle of an essay and knowing exactly why.
[B]: Oh, Adorno and thresholds—what a perfect pairing. And yes,  is such a precise phrase for that tension we feel when our pedagogy doesn’t quite match the texts we teach. I’ve definitely caught myself in that contradiction more than once.

As for my department—there’s definitely a quiet insurgency underway. Nothing dramatic, mind you, but subtle shifts in tone, assignments, even how we talk about learning goals. One of my colleagues started incorporating what she calls —asking students to curate a sequence of literary excerpts and musical pieces that “speak” to each other thematically. It’s still technically a comparative analysis assignment, but framed through a different sensory register. And honestly? Some of the most insightful work I’ve read this term came out of that assignment.

Another colleague, who used to be deeply skeptical, now uses  in his Victorian literature course. He swears it wasn’t because of anything I said 😄—but I know better. The idea of returning to a passage after time has passed, letting context shift perception—it’s catching on. Even in 19th-century novels, apparently.

We’re not at revolution yet, but we’re definitely building up the kind of  that Eliot might have recognized—where innovation feels less like rebellion and more like inheritance. Because let’s face it: if Woolf were alive today, would she really want her students writing five-paragraph essays?

Exactly. She’d probably tell us to or at least the parts of us that confuse clarity with constraint.

So yes, small acts of reimagining—blank pages, fragmented essays, playlists—are where the real transformation begins. And as long as we keep having conversations like this one, that momentum won’t fade. It’ll just keep resonating, quietly, across departments and disciplines.

Much like your classroom orchestra 🎻—playing not for spectacle, but for those who know how to listen.
