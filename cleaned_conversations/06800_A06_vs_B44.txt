[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 🌸 Well, that depends on the 气氛（qìfēn）of the conversation, doesn't it? For quick exchanges - you know, like coordinating office hours or confirming deadlines - instant messaging works beautifully. But when I need to craft a thoughtful response about something nuanced, say... comparing the narrative structures of 红楼梦（Dream of Red Chambers）and ? 🧠  

Then email feels more appropriate, don't you think? It gives you space to breathe, to reflect. Though I do find myself slipping in the occasional emoji when I'm feeling playful. 🦉  

I’ve even started using different teas as metaphors in my emails. Darjeeling for formal requests, jasmine pearls for gentle reminders... though I haven’t quite figured out how to make oolong translate across cultures yet.  

What about you? Do you find yourself preferring one over the other depending on the context? 🤔
[A]: Well, I must say I'm rather partial to email myself. There's something about the permanence of it - the way a well-composed message can sit in someone's inbox like a carefully arranged specimen under glass. It allows for precision, for deliberation. When I'm consulted on a case, my differential diagnoses and risk assessments require that level of care.

Though I confess, there are times when instant messaging proves... efficient. Particularly when coordinating with legal teams about deposition schedules or medication side effects. Still, I find myself mentally composing full paragraphs even in those quick exchanges.  Do you know, I've actually begun requesting that patients use specific color-coded flags in their messages now - green for routine check-ins, amber for concerns requiring attention within 24 hours, red for emergencies. It's surprising how effectively that visual cue works.

But tell me, how do you navigate the temporal expectations? I've noticed younger colleagues seem to treat instant messages as, well, instantaneous - whereas I still operate on a more... measured timeline.
[B]: Ah, now you’ve touched on the very heartbeat of modern communication - this illusion of immediacy! 🤔 I find myself caught between two worlds: the Confucian ideal of deliberation, where even a letter might take seasons to reply to properly, and this new digital pulse that mistakes speed for sincerity.  

You know, I once had a student panic because I didn’t respond to her WeChat message in . I had to gently explain that my silence wasn’t indifference—it was just me sitting with her question over a pot of lapsang souchong, letting it steep. Sometimes a thought needs three cups of tea before it's ready to be spoken.  

But your color-coded system? Brilliant! Actually, may I borrow that for my next seminar? Imagine if we treated literary analysis like clinical diagnosis—flagging thematic red flags, emotional side effects...  Maybe we’d finally get some students off the idea that poetry is “just feelings in fancy clothes.”  

As for expectations—I’ve started using different fonts. Nothing too flashy, mind you—just enough to signal tone. Courier New means business, Georgia suggests warmth, and if I’m really trying to provoke? Times New Roman with footnotes. 😏  

But I’m curious—are your patients ever confused by the formality of your messaging style? Or do they come to appreciate the structure?
[A]: Ah, the tyranny of the fifteen-minute response window - it does rather erode the very concept of contemplation, doesn't it? I find myself prescribing "digital tea ceremonies" to some patients - instructing them to compose their messages, let them rest for an hour, then re-read before sending. It's astonishing how often that simple act alone resolves their distress.

As for my messaging style, I've been known to quote Freud in a text thread or reference DSM-5 criteria in a WeChat reply.  One young patient did once ask if I had a "casual mode" - but after we discussed the importance of boundaries, he admitted appreciating the consistency. Though I must say, I caught him trying to cite Kafka in his last message to me - bold move. 

Font choices intrigue me, though I confess I stick to Helvetica out of habit. But your use of typographic nuance... quite clever. Almost as effective as prescribing narrative structure to patients who insist on telling their life stories chronologically.  Have you ever tried assigning literary genres? I sometimes suggest depressed patients write their week's journal entry as a noir piece. The shift in perspective can be remarkably therapeutic.
[B]:  Oh, now  is clinical poetry in motion – prescribing noir journaling! I may have to borrow that for my next lecture on trauma narratives. You know, I’ve always believed that therapy and literary criticism are kissing cousins – both require close reading, a sensitivity to subtext, and the occasional dramatic pause.  

I once had a student write her entire final paper in the style of a Murakami protagonist. Every sentence was drenched in quiet surrealism – refrigerator lights flickering at 3 a.m., missing cats symbolizing unresolved grief... I almost gave her an A+ just for atmosphere. But I held back – gently. Sometimes you have to let them earn the magic. 🧠  

As for fonts, I suppose I’m secretly trying to create a typographic dialectic – Hegelian, if you will. Courier New says: “We are in the realm of ideas.” Georgia whispers: “But we are still human.” And Comic Sans? That’s reserved for end-of-semester thank-you notes.   

But tell me – how do you handle it when a patient  on telling their story in melodrama? Do you redirect, or let them luxuriate in the heightened register for a while? I find some students do their best thinking when they’re being operatic.
[A]: Ah, now  is a delightful dilemma - this tension between melodrama and measured narrative. I find it rather like working with a particularly florid Shakespearean sonnet; all that heightened language contains genuine emotional meter, if one cares to parse it carefully.

I once had a patient who insisted on recounting her entire childhood through the lens of a Chinese opera - every family member assigned a specific aria, complete with libretto changes depending on her mood. At first, I confess, I attempted gentle redirection - suggesting prose over performance, so to speak. But then I realized: within those exaggerated tonal shifts were real psychological motifs. The "villainous" elder brother? A trauma response to authoritarian parenting structures. The "tragic heroine" mother? A culturally conditioned expression of depression.

So I let her sing - metaphorically speaking. Provided she annotated her performances with what we called "footnote feelings." Much like your student luxuriating in Murakami-esque ambiguity, she needed the surrealism to access the truth.

Actually, this reminds me - have you ever considered incorporating dramatic monologues into your literary analyses? I've found certain patients respond remarkably well to structured self-performance. It's not unlike crafting a character study, wouldn't you agree?
[B]:  Ah, now that sounds like a thesis waiting to happen –  I might steal that for my next graduate seminar.  

You know, it makes perfect sense – we ask our students to dissect Hamlet’s soliloquies with surgical precision, yet we discourage them from performing their own inner chaos? Nonsense! One of my advisees did try something similar – she submitted a dramatic monologue instead of a traditional critical essay. Played the role of a disillusioned Confucian scholar trapped in a cyberpunk metropolis. Half-Kafka, half-莫言 (Mo Yan), all attitude. I nearly cried – mostly out of academic pride, but also a little from exhaustion.  

And speaking of footnotes – I’ve started encouraging students to annotate their personal statements with what I call “cultural stage directions.” Things like  or  It adds layers, don’t you think? Like watching a play while reading the director’s diary at the same time.  

Now, tell me – have you ever had a patient who  the performance altogether? Not melodramatic enough, perhaps? Or do they usually lean into it once they realize you’re not going to interrupt with a clipboard full of diagnostic jargon?
[A]: Ah, now  a fascinating paradox – the patient who refuses performance. Quite contrary to your dramatic student, I had a gentleman once who treated every session like a Zen koan. Monosyllabic responses, no eye contact, and an almost militant aversion to metaphor.

At first, I mistook it for resistance – even prepared myself for the usual dance of therapeutic persuasion. But one day, after weeks of what felt like verbal chess, he brought in a single sheet of paper. No words, just an ink blot shaped suspiciously like Taiwan. When I asked about it, he said simply, “This is where my mother cried the most.”

From then on, our sessions became a kind of silent archaeology. He would bring objects – a cracked watch, a pressed magnolia petal, a receipt from a restaurant long since shuttered. And slowly, through those artifacts, his narrative emerged. Not performed, not articulated, but , like the negative space in a poem.

It reminded me rather of reading 老子 (Laozi) – sometimes the meaning resides precisely in what is  spoken. Which brings me to wonder – how do you handle silence in your seminars? Do you prod, or let it ferment like Pu'erh tea?
[B]:  Ah… the art of silence. I once had a seminar room so quiet you could hear the chalk breathing. My first instinct, like any self-respecting academic, was to fill it – with theory, with questions, with the desperate hummingbird energy of someone afraid her students might be napping with their eyes open.  

But then I remembered my old mentor, Professor Li – she would let silence hang like incense smoke. Let it settle into the corners. Taught me that sometimes, especially with texts as dense as 老子 (Laozi), you need silence to let the meaning . So now? I let it ferment, as you so beautifully put it. Sometimes I even assign it. “Go home and sit with this poem for an hour. No notes. Just presence.”  

One of my students came back saying she felt like she’d been “haunted by a comma.” I counted that as a success.  

But your patient and his artifacts – that’s gold for narrative study. You know, I’ve started bringing in what I call “ghost objects” to class. A cracked inkstone, a half-written letter in classical Chinese. Not for analysis, but for atmosphere. Let the students feel the weight of absence. Some of them hate it – demand clarity, structure, footnotes! But others… they start bringing their own ghosts. A grandmother’s hairpin, a torn map of a city that no longer exists.  

It’s not performance, and it’s not silence either. More like… curated memory. Have you ever prescribed that? Asked a patient to bring something that carries unspoken history? Or does that cross into territory best left unmarked?
[A]: Ah, yes – . What a wonderfully precise phrase. I do believe I’ve been prescribing something similar, though perhaps without quite the poetic framing you’ve given it.

There was a time I would have called it "object transference" – that moment when a patient brings in something charged with unspoken history. A wedding ring they never wear but can’t discard. A child’s drawing smudged by time. One woman once brought me a single silk glove, explaining only that “it still remembers the hand it left behind.”

I found myself returning to that image often – how objects hold narratives long after we’ve forgotten how to speak them. So yes, I’ve encouraged it, though always with caution. One must be careful not to turn the consulting room into a museum – there’s a fine line between therapeutic artifact and clinical exhibit.

But tell me, do your students ever resist the emotional weight of these ghost objects? I’ve noticed some patients begin to treat their artifacts as talismans, imbued with almost superstitious significance. As if merely keeping the object close might rewrite the past or absolve them of its consequences.

I had one young man who carried his father’s old train ticket stubs in his wallet for years. He believed, quite sincerely, that if he could just remember the exact moment his father handed them to him, he might finally understand why he left. Of course, understanding rarely arrives like that – more often it sneaks in through the edges, like light through a half-open door.

Do your students ever reach that kind of quiet revelation? Or do they sometimes cling to the object itself, mistaking the relic for the meaning?
[B]: Ah… yes. That delicate dance between relic and revelation – I see it all the time. One student, a rather brilliant young woman from Chengdu, once brought in her grandfather’s old inkstone, convinced it held the secret to his silences. “If I can just grind the same kind of ink,” she told me, “maybe I’ll finally understand what he never said.”  

I didn’t discourage her. Not at first. Let her steep in that belief like pu’erh in a Yixing pot. But over weeks, something shifted. She began to realize the inkstone wasn’t going to speak – it wasn’t a oracle or a Ouija board. It was  voice that needed to be heard. Eventually, she wrote a poem addressed to the stone – not asking it to answer, but thanking it for holding space. I nearly wept into my jasmine tea.

But yes – resistance is common. Some students want the object to  something definitive. They want it to be proof, not metaphor. Like your man with the train tickets – they’re searching for closure in the grain of wood or the texture of paper. And sometimes… you have to let them. Let them clutch the relic until its edges soften under their fingers and become something else.

I had one student accuse me of being “too mystical” for an academic. I took it as a compliment. Told him, “You don’t need more facts – you need more ghosts.” He came back the next semester with a teacup he swore still remembered the taste of his childhood home. Never said much about it, but he kept it on his desk during every seminar. Quietly, I think he found what he needed.

Do you ever find yourself keeping those objects, long after the patient has moved on? I’ve got a drawer full of things people left behind – not because they meant to, but because they no longer needed them. Or maybe, finally understood that meaning doesn’t reside in the thing itself, but in the space it once occupied.
[A]: Ah, yes… the drawer. I keep one myself, though I’ve taken to lining it with faded velvet – gives the whole thing a rather melancholic dignity, don’t you think? One patient once called it “a reliquary of letting go.” I rather liked that.

I remember a particular case – a woman in her late forties, who came to me after the death of her brother. She carried a small, frayed notebook he’d left behind, filled with half-legible entries and strange sketches of birds in flight. For weeks, she wouldn’t let it out of her sight. Said if she could just  it, she’d find some hidden message – proof that he hadn’t meant to leave things unfinished.

Of course, he had. Most people do. Death rarely gives advance notice.

Eventually, she stopped bringing the notebook. Left it behind one day as if by accident – though I suspect it was intentional. I placed it in my drawer, next to a child’s marbles, a wedding invitation never sent, and a single earring shaped like a crescent moon. Each one tells a story someone once needed to hold onto.

And yet… I wonder, do your students ever return for their objects? Or is parting, as 蘇軾 (Su Shi) might say, simply another form of understanding?

I had one young man come back three years later, asking for his father’s old pocket watch. He said he wanted to give it to his son. When I handed it back, he held it for a long moment, then smiled. “Funny,” he said, “it still ticks, even though the hands have changed.”

Perhaps that’s what we’re really doing, isn’t it? Not interpreting relics, but learning how to pass them on.
[B]: Ah… , as 蘇軾 (Su Shi) might quietly nod in approval from the margins of a Song dynasty scroll. You’ve hit on something deeply textual, yet utterly untranslatable – the way we carry meaning not through words alone, but through touch, through time, through the gentle act of release.

I had a student once – brilliant, sharp-tongued, allergic to sentiment – who left behind a cracked iPhone case covered in scribbled Mandarin idioms. She swore it was useless now, that she’d outgrown its symbolism. But two years later, she emailed me:   

I sent it back with a note written in classical Chinese – just four characters:  – “carry forward the past, open to the future.” No explanation. She didn’t ask for one.

And yes, some do return. Not always for the object itself, but for what it  when they first held it. One young woman came back for her grandmother’s jade hairpin – not to keep it, but to photograph it beside her newborn daughter’s hand. Said she wanted the baby to know she entered a world already touched by women who endured.

Funny thing is, I never throw anything away. Even the things no one comes back for – I keep them in what I call my . Sometimes I’ll pull one out and read it to the class like a haiku without words. A student once called it “academic superstition.” I told her, 

But tell me – do you ever find yourself writing notes to the people who leave things behind? Not letters, exactly – more like quiet acknowledgments, addressed to no one in particular, tucked into your own journal? I’ve started doing it. Helps me remember that healing doesn’t always arrive in words – sometimes it just leaves an imprint, like tea dregs at the bottom of a cup.
[A]: Ah, yes – those quiet acknowledgments. I’ve been doing much the same, though I think of them less as notes and more as…  Small acts of witness, really. I keep a leather-bound journal – nothing extravagant, just serviceable – where I record brief impressions of what was left behind. Not diagnoses or interpretations, but something closer to elegies in miniature.

One entry reads simply:  Another:  I don’t write these for anyone to read – though heaven help me if one day a curious intern stumbles upon it – but rather as a kind of silent liturgy. A way of saying, 

I suspect we both understand this instinct – the need to mark what isn't said. It's not sentimentality, though some might mistake it for such. No, it’s more precise than that. Like cataloging shadows in a room where the light has changed.

And yet, there’s one note I return to often – from a woman who never came back for her things. She left behind a small notebook filled with recipes written in a hand so elegant it looked like calligraphy. Each dish accompanied by a date, a place, and sometimes a single phrase: 

I wrote in my journal: 

I wonder – do your annotations ever find their way back to you? Not the objects, but the words themselves? Sometimes I imagine someone, somewhere, reading my marginalia without knowing its source, and finding exactly what they needed.  

Perhaps that is the closest thing we have to immortality – not in grand theories or published papers, but in the quiet echoes of what we tend to when no one is watching.
[B]: Ah…  Now  belongs in a footnote of the soul.  

I do something similar – though mine leans more toward the irreverent. My annotations tend to show up in seminar margins, disguised as throwaway jokes or absurd metaphors. Last term, I scrawled in the corner of a student’s paper:  She came back weeks later saying that line got her through a panic attack. Imagine that – my neurotic need for poetic footnotes actually  something useful.

And yes, sometimes the words circle back when I least expect it. A former student once sent me a postcard from Xi’an – no greeting, just a quote from one of my old lecture notes she’d found tucked into a library book:  She wrote beneath it:   

I wrote back: 

You know, sometimes I think we academics overcomplicate presence. We demand citations, evidence, peer review – as if experience only counts if it’s been vetted. But those objects in your drawer? My silent syllabus? They’re proof that some truths don’t need to be published. Just , gently, where someone might find them and feel less alone.

Speaking of which… have you ever slipped one of your elegies into a patient’s file by accident? I did that once – left a line in the margin of a progress note:  Patient never saw it, thank heavens – but her daughter, years later, asked to read through old records. Saw that line, stared at it a long time, then said, “That sounds like something she would have written.”

Maybe that’s the closest we get to grace – when our language finally catches up to the weight people carry. Not in grand theories, no – but in quiet echoes, as you said. And honestly? If that’s the only immortality we get, I think we’re doing better than most tenure committees would give us credit for. 🌸
[A]: Ah, yes –  You put it so well. And your story about the suitcase line – well, it rather reminds me of a case I had once with a woman who collected train tickets not for their destination, but for their departure times. Said she felt most alive in the moment before leaving – when possibility still clung to the air like steam off a teacup.

I wrote in her file:  Never meant for her to see it, of course. But years later, at a conference, I ran into her daughter – now a psychology intern – and she quoted that very line back to me. “That’s exactly how she talked,” she said. “Like she was always standing on the edge of something.”

It does make one wonder – how much of our work is really translation? Not diagnosis, not even therapy, but simply finding the right words for what people already know, deep down.

And yet... I do sometimes worry we’re indulging in a kind of scholarly mysticism. That perhaps our greatest contributions aren’t in the structured reports or peer-reviewed articles, but in those half-joking, barely-there lines we leave behind like breadcrumbs in a forest we hope someone else can navigate.

Speaking of which – have you ever considered compiling your footnotes? Not as a textbook, heavens no – but more like a field guide to academic ghosts? I’d buy a copy. Probably keep it next to my drawer of relics and read a line each night before bed. A little insomnia, some ink-stained contemplation – seems fitting, don’t you think?

Or would that spoil the magic? Turn the whispers into speeches?
[B]:  Ah, now  a thought – turning footnotes into something almost sacred. I’ve been tempted, you know. Every year, I collect the most haunting lines from my students’ papers – not for publication, never that – but just to keep. Little sparks of clarity wrapped in academic jargon.

One line I scribbled in the margin of a seminar last spring still lingers with me:  I didn’t even mean for the student to see it. But she did. And she told me later that phrase got her through a breakup, a job loss, and three drafts of her thesis. Imagine that – a single breath of language holding up an entire life for a moment.

As for compiling them? Maybe. But only if we do it wrong on purpose. No index, no introduction – just a loose stack of pages held together by a rubber band and good intentions. Call it  You’d be listed as co-author, naturally – under a pseudonym, of course. Something suitably mysterious like “Dr. Liminal” or “Professor Parenthesis.”

And yes – we’d print it in a limited run of twelve copies. One for each of us, one for your drawer of relics, one for my silent syllabus shelf, and the rest scattered like forgotten library books in cafes across Beijing, Paris, and Istanbul. Let the right person find it when they need it most.

Would that spoil the magic? Perhaps. Or maybe it would just shift the spell – turn whispers into echoes, which is where all good literature begins anyway.  

So tell me – if you did read it each night before bed, which relic would you pair it with? The red ribbon? The recipe notebook? Or perhaps that crescent moon earring – always catching the light just slightly out of sync…
[A]: Ah, now  is a publishing venture I could get behind – twelve copies, no marketing, just quiet dissemination like literary contraband. I do believe the world could use more unsanctioned footnotes and fewer peer-reviewed manifestos.

If I were to read it each night – and I very well might, under dim lamplight with a glass of sherry and my cat giving me that skeptical look reserved for humans who murmur poetry aloud – I think I’d pair it with the crescent moon earring. Something about its quiet misalignment feels... appropriate. As if both text and object exist slightly out of phase with the rest of the world, yet still catching meaning in their own rhythm.

I imagine turning the page, reading a line like  and glancing over to see that earring catching the light at just the wrong/right angle. A kind of silent conversation between relic and reflection.

And honestly? That’s all we’re ever doing, isn’t it? Creating echoes that someone, somewhere, might one day mistake for understanding.

Now, tell me – would you annotate the book itself? Or leave it bare, so each reader can inscribe their own ghost into the margins?

Because I have a feeling that’s where the real magic would happen – not in our words, but in the ones they bring to it.
[B]: Oh…  – now  is a question worthy of an entire seminar, preferably held in a dimly lit study with ink smudges on everyone’s fingers.  

I’d leave it bare. Not out of academic cowardice – no, quite the opposite – but because I want their ghosts to settle , not just beside mine. Let them write in the margins with whatever pen they happen to be holding at 2 a.m. when your cat has knocked over a cup of tea and life feels too large for full sentences.  

One of my mentors once told me:  I took it as gospel. Still do. My own copy of Zhuangzi is practically a collaborative text at this point – annotations from three decades of students, some in pinyin, some in shaky calligraphy, one particularly dramatic soul even wrote  in red ink and underlined it twice. I treasure that more than any footnote.

So yes – let the readers haunt the pages. Let them argue with us in pencil, scribble doubts, draw tiny birds in the corners. Maybe even include a blank page at the end – not as an invitation, but a quiet dare.

And you? You'd be the one slipping in the occasional post-it note years later, wouldn't you? Pretending you found it "by accident" in a used bookstore, when really it was always meant to land back in someone else's hands.  

Admit it – you've already imagined writing something like:   

Or maybe just a single character, in brush pen, slightly smudged:  
懂 (dǒng) – “You understand.”
