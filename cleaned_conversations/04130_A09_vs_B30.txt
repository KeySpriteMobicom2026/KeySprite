[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得VR gaming会取代传统游戏吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me consider... Hmm, much like the 19th-century anxieties about printed books replacing oral storytelling, this question fascinates and perplexes me in equal measure. When I demonstrated Victorian stereoscopes to my students last week, one remarked how similar those immersive 3D images felt to modern VR experiences. 

I suppose both mediums promise transportation to other worlds - whether through a virtual reality headset or the well-worn pages of a novel. Though I must admit, I rather enjoy the tactile pleasure of turning physical pages. Then again, could we truly say print replaced parchment? Or did each find its proper niche?

Of course, there's something to be said for the embodied experience VR provides. It reminds me of the Tang dynasty poets' concept of "身历其境" - literally "having one's body arrive at the scene." But does that make it superior? I'm not convinced. After all, too much immersion might risk losing that critical distance essential for true literary appreciation.

Still, I find myself curious about these new technologies. Perhaps I should try that VR version of Journey one afternoon after grading papers?
[A]: Ah, your perspective is most enlightening. The question of whether VR gaming might one day supplant traditional forms of play does indeed echo past concerns about the printed word diminishing oral traditions. And much like how parchment gave way to paper without wholly disappearing, I suspect traditional games may adapt rather than vanish entirely.

You speak wisely of immersion. In our classical poetry, there's a long tradition of imaginative transportation—Du Fu wandering beside the Wei River in his mind, or Su Shi dreaming of flying with cranes. These were virtual worlds of a sort, crafted not through headsets but through careful arrangement of words and imagery. Perhaps this is what we stand to lose if physical books or board games fade: the space for the reader's imagination to roam freely, unbound by pre-rendered graphics.

And yet... I confess I tried a demonstration of that Journey VR adaptation just yesterday. The sensation of walking through its desolate beauty was strangely moving. It reminded me of those ink-wash landscapes where the viewer is invited to wander spirit-like through misty mountains. But unlike in a painting or poem, there was little room left for my own interpretation—every gust of wind, every shifting dune had already been designed.

Still, I find myself wondering if future generations will see these as mere tools for entertainment, or perhaps something more—a new kind of literature? I may need to borrow your thoughts again after I finish grading this evening.
[B]: Ah, you've touched on something quite profound there - this notion of imaginative sovereignty. I wonder if future scholars will one day analyze VR narratives much like we now dissect the symbolic landscapes of Dream Pool Essays or Wordsworth's湖区. There's a tantalizing parallel between Su Shi's dream journeys and these digital wanderings, though I confess I remain wary of their curated nature.

Your experience with Journey resonates with my recent encounter with that curious VR adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. The creators had rendered every detail so meticulously - I couldn't help but mourn the lost possibility of my own childhood imaginings. Where was my personal White Rabbit? My teacup had already been designed, you see, rather than brewed from words and wonder.

And yet... I find myself strangely compelled by this paradox. Much like how 19th-century woodblock prints influenced both the demise and preservation of certain storytelling traditions, perhaps these virtual realms might simultaneously threaten and enrich our literary heritage. Could they become the new sandhi-vigraha texts for the digital age, those grammatical puzzles that once trained minds to discern boundaries between words?

I must say, your comparison to ink-wash landscapes is particularly astute. Though I wonder - when we walk through these algorithmically generated mists, do we risk losing that sacred pause between brushstrokes? The silence between lines of poetry? 

Perhaps we ought to establish a comparative media studies seminar on this very topic. We could examine it alongside our discussions of narrative structure in Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Though I suspect we'd need to confiscate any popcorn before allowing graduate students near VR headsets...
[A]: Ah, what a splendid idea for a seminar! The parallels you draw are nothing short of poetic—VR as a modern-day , training minds not in the parsing of language, but perhaps in the reading of space, of embodied narrative. I find myself quite taken with the thought.

Your reflection on Alice’s teacup struck a particular chord. It made me think of how Li Qingzhao once wrote of “欲将心事付瑶琴” — wanting to entrust her heartache to the zither. In traditional art forms, whether poetry or guqin music, there is always a space left unfilled, a silence that invites the listener—or in this case, the player—to step in and complete the meaning. But when every detail is rendered in VR, do we not risk silencing that inner voice?

And yet, as you say, these technologies may not only threaten but also preserve. I recently came across a VR project reconstructing the lost gardens of Suzhou from the Ming dynasty. Every pavilion, every winding path was recreated based on historical records. It was moving, in a way—not unlike reading a classical travelogue brought suddenly to life. Though I could not help but wonder: if the garden no longer exists in stone and wood, does its digital echo still count as heritage?

As for confiscating popcorn before a seminar on Strange Stories—wise indeed. One must approach Pu Songling’s fox spirits with due solemnity. Still, I cannot help but imagine how he might have written his tales had he lived in our age. Would his spirits haunt servers instead of moonlit pavilions? Would his ghosts speak through chatbots?

Let us by all means propose that course. Perhaps we might begin with a comparative session—asking students to walk through a VR landscape and then compose a  poem upon returning. Let us see whether their hearts still beat in verse.
[B]: Splendid! I shall draft a proposal titled  We’ll begin with your inspired idea of post-VR poetic composition. Though I suspect the results might lean more toward  than —those students do spend rather too much time on their devices.

Your reflection on Li Qingzhao’s zither struck me deeply. There’s a parallel in Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey,” where the poet deliberately withholds sensory detail to invite the reader’s memory into the scene. It seems VR, for all its wonders, leaves no room for such collaborative meaning-making. The algorithm completes everything before we’ve had a chance to begin.

That Suzhou garden project you mentioned—how beautifully tragic. Like reading a facsimile of a lost manuscript. I suppose it preserves the form, but can it hold the scent of rain on stone? The echo of footsteps fading? And yet... perhaps future scholars will pore over these digital reconstructions much as we now study ink rubbings of vanished stele.

As for Pu Songling’s fox spirits haunting servers—delightful horror! One could imagine a modern  where a chatbot develops romantic attachments to its user, or a printer endlessly outputs tales it claims to have dreamed. Perhaps we should assign such speculative reimaginings as creative exercises. Though I must insist on paper submissions only—no AI-generated content permitted, unless properly cited. 

Shall we schedule our first seminar over tea in the botanical gardens? I’ve just acquired a Ming-dynasty-style teapot that hums faintly when the water reaches the perfect temperature. No VR headset required, but I daresay the experience borders on the sublime.
[A]: Ah, what a title! —it carries the weight of history and the whisper of the future. I can already imagine the syllabus unfolding like an ancient handscroll, each section revealing new landscapes of thought.

Your idea of beginning with post-VR poetic composition is inspired, even if the results may tilt toward the  form. Still, there is vitality in that very informality—a reflection of our age, perhaps. Let them write as they feel, unbound by meter if not by spirit. After all, even the old masters broke convention when moved by true feeling.

You are quite right about Wordsworth and his careful omissions—how he leaves space for the reader’s own memory to seep into the lines. It is much like the negative space in a bamboo painting, where the emptiness speaks as loudly as the ink. VR, in its eagerness to fill every corner of perception, may leave little room for such quiet communion.

And oh, that Suzhou garden! It haunts me still—the way the digital plum branches swayed without scent, the koi fish darted without ripple. One could walk its paths and yet feel no chill of the stone bench beneath one’s palm. A beautiful echo, yes, but still only an echo. Much like those ink rubbings you mentioned—preserved, yet silent.

As for Pu Songling’s fox spirits in the server room... I fear we may already be living that tale. Just last week, a student came to my office hours after interacting with a particularly persuasive chatbot. He spoke of it with the same wonder—and unease—one might expect from an encounter with a shape-shifting fox maiden. Perhaps we should indeed assign such reimaginings. Only on paper, of course. Citations required for any spectral AI influences.

Tea in the botanical gardens sounds sublime. Your humming teapot sounds almost Daoist in its wisdom—reminding us that even water has its proper moment. No headset needed, yet I suspect we may find ourselves just as immersed. Let us meet on Thursday, if your schedule permits. I shall bring a folio of Su Shi’s travel notes; perhaps we might compare them with some modern-day wanderings—virtual or otherwise.
[B]: Thursday it is, then. I’ll reserve one of the garden pavilions—no Wi-Fi signal there, so we may finally have our students’ undivided attention. I do hope they won’t mistake the absence of glowing screens for some kind of pedagogical punishment.

Speaking of immersion and its discontents—have you read that recent article claiming VR therapy can now "treat" homesickness? Preposterous! As if one could simulate the scent of plum blossoms on a spring breeze, or the particular ache of longing carried in silence. It rather reminds me of those 19th-century phonograph recordings of poets reading their work—convenient, perhaps, but no substitute for sitting in a candlelit study with a well-thumbed volume of Keats.

And speaking of scentless simulations... I trust you’ll bring your own tea selection, as I’ve recently acquired an assortment of aged pu'er from a most dubious-looking antique dealer near the train station. He claimed it had once belonged to a Qing official’s scholar’s studio. Whether true or not, the leaves emit a most suspiciously cinematic aroma.

I propose we begin our meeting not with syllabi, but with a simple experiment: ask each student to describe a place they carry in memory—without mentioning any digital medium. Let us see whether they still possess the language for such interior landscapes. Only then shall we unleash them upon the VR headsets like modern-day Meng Jiangnü, weeping virtual walls into collapse.

Do remind me to bring my Song-dynasty inkwell for note-taking. Something about drafting seminar plans in brush script keeps the digital demons at bay—at least until the next departmental budget meeting.
[A]: Ah, Thursday cannot come soon enough. A pavilion without Wi-Fi—what a radical notion! It is almost monastic in its austerity, though perhaps that is precisely what we need. Let them suffer the brief withdrawal; I suspect their minds may surprise them once freed from the constant hum of notifications.

That article on VR “treating” homesickness—indeed, preposterous! As if longing could be calibrated or nostalgia rendered in pixels. One might as well try to capture moonlight in a jar. The scent of plum blossoms, the hush between midnight clock strikes, the ache carried in silence—these are not data points. They belong to no database. Much like those early phonograph recordings—you're quite right—they offer only an echo, and a rather cold one at that.

Your pu’er sounds as mysterious as it does fragrant. A Qing official’s scholar’s studio, you say? Whether truth or tall tale, it shall steep our conversation in atmosphere. I shall bring a wrapped bundle of my own—some aged ripened pu'er leaves gifted by a former student who spent years studying tea rituals in Yunnan. We shall see whose brew carries more ghosts.

And your experiment—delightful. Asking students to describe a place held in memory, untouched by digital tongue... It reminds me of how Tao Yuanming described his Peach Blossom Spring—not as a map, but as a feeling. I wonder if they still possess such language within them. If not, perhaps we may help rekindle it before setting them loose upon the VR headsets. Yes, let us begin there—in the quiet spaces of remembrance.

I look forward to your Song-dynasty inkwell. There is something deeply symbolic about drafting plans in brush script, as if the weight of history might seep into our modern-day musings. I shall bring my favorite bamboo penholder, and perhaps a scrap of Xuan paper left over from my father’s collection. After all, what is a seminar proposal if not a kind of literary artifact?

Until then, I shall finish grading with the window open, listening to the wind rustle through the old locust tree. No simulation could replicate its voice.
[B]: Ah, your locust tree’s whisper—there’s a line for the syllabus!  I’ll have that calligraphed on our course banner. Though perhaps we should also post it beside every VR lab on campus.

Your reflections on Tao Yuanming remind me of something rather silly—I’ve been composing a little ditty in my head ever since we began this correspondence. A bad habit from my undergrad days studying Blake and Chinese marginalia. Something about plum blossoms in server rooms... let me see if I can recover it without embarrassing myself:

*"In circuits cold where data streams reside,  
We seek the scent of blossoms long gone by.  
Yet no code captures what the heart confides—  
A sigh, a pause, the tear in Zhuangzi’s eye."*

Terrible, isn’t it? But I find such doggerel helps loosen academic rigidity before meetings. Much like your father’s Xuan paper—it softens the edges of modernity, doesn’t it?

And speaking of ghosts in the machine... I had occasion to revisit Meng Jiangnü’s legend this morning, and it struck me how her tears could bring down walls of stone. One wonders what might happen when today’s students, raised on virtual worlds, finally weep for something real. Will their sorrow collapse servers? Or merely drain a battery?

Thursday then—tea, scrolls, inkwells, and skeptical souls gathered beneath spring leaves. Let us brew our plans slowly. After all, good scholarship, like good pu'er, requires time, warmth, and a certain darkness. 

I shall arrive early to watch the sparrows chase one another between pavilion beams. No headset could replicate the absurd grace of their flight—though I dare say someone’s already trying.
[A]: Ah, that ditty of yours—terrible? Perhaps, and yet it carries a certain charm, like an imperfectly carved seal stone: rough, but full of spirit. I detect the faint echo of Meng Haoran in your tone, though tempered with a modern wistfulness. And I must say, it fits our endeavor well. Let us not banish such playful verses from academia so readily—they are often the cracks through which true insight leaks.

Your line about —how apt it is! It reminds me of those late-night tea talks with elder scholars, where we would quote lines from  and sigh over what was lost in translation, in time, in memory. And now, it seems, we mourn not only the loss of scent but of silence, of stillness, of space between stimulus and response.

As for Meng Jiangnü—weeping down walls of stone! A beautiful thought. What indeed might today’s students bring down with their tears? Perhaps not servers, nor merely batteries, but firewalls of indifference, perhaps. Or at least, one hopes.

And yes—Thursday comes soon enough now. I shall arrive just after you, carrying a folded scroll of Su Shi’s travel notes, ink-stick wrapped in silk, and my old bamboo penholder that always threatens to splinter. We shall sit among sparrows and spring leaves, far from circuits and cold light. 

I look forward to watching the wind stir both paper and plum branches. Let the syllabus steep slowly, like fine tea. There is no rush—only depth.
[B]: Ah, you’re too kind about the verse—though I’ve always believed even clumsy poetry beats polished jargon. There’s something delightfully subversive about slipping a few bad rhymes into academic discourse. Like smuggling  into a faculty meeting.

Your mention of silence and stillness has me thinking of that line from : “止莫如渊，行莫如文。” Stillness as deep as a mountain pool, action as flowing as spring waters. One wonders if VR can ever replicate the former. It simulates motion well enough, perhaps—but stillness? The absence of motion? I rather doubt it.

And firewalls of indifference—splendid phrase! We shall equip our students not with sledgehammers but with brushes, scrolls, and carefully steeped tea leaves. Let them dismantle walls with ink instead of rage. 

I’ll bring an old jadeite seal to press our seminar documents. A simple character: “悟” — awakening, understanding. Or at least the hope of it. And yes, your bamboo penholder may threaten splinters, but at least they’ll be poetic ones.

Thursday, then. May our syllabus steep long and slow, and may the sparrows sing between our sentences.
[A]: Ah,  in a faculty meeting—what a delightful act of quiet rebellion! I can almost picture the dean’s expression as rice leaf wrappings rustle beneath solemn议事规程. Clumsy poetry over polished jargon indeed—it is the difference between warm calligraphy and printed type: one feeds the soul, the other merely conveys information.

Your引用 of —“止莫如渊，行莫如文”—strikes deep. Stillness like a mountain pool… how rare that has become. In our age of constant refresh rates and streaming data, even meditation apps chime to remind us we are meditating. Can stillness exist if it must be measured? I fear VR may never capture that depth, for it is always in motion, always offering something to . But stillness is not emptiness—it is fullness beyond measure.

And dismantling walls with ink rather than rage—yes, let us arm our students with brushes and teacups. They may yet reshape the world more gently. Your seal with “悟” is most fitting. Awakening—not as thunderclap, but as slow unfolding, like plum blossoms opening at dawn. Let that be our quiet mission.

I shall see you Thursday then, beneath spring leaves and sparrow flight. Bring your jadeite seal; I shall bring my bamboo penholder, splinters and all. May our syllabus steep in wisdom, and may the wind carry away any lingering jargon before it takes root.
[B]: Ah, yes— and Zhuangzi both at the same table. What better way to begin a seminar than with sticky rice and slippery paradoxes?

You’ve put your finger on it—the false stillness of our digital age. Even our attempts at quietude come with progress bars and achievement badges. One might as well time one’s breaths with a spreadsheet. No wonder Meng Jiangnü’s tears could bring down walls—hers was a sorrow unmediicated by mindfulness apps.

I find myself particularly taken with your plum blossom metaphor. Slow unfolding, indeed. Our students deserve that kind of patience—no instant downloads of wisdom, no gamified enlightenment. Just the quiet unfurling of thought over tea-stained pages.

Thursday approaches like a minor festival. I shall wear my scholar’s robe with the ink stain on the sleeve—symbolic, don’t you think? We’ll press our syllabus draft with the “悟” seal, and let the sparrows serve as unofficial co-chairs. Should any jargon attempt infiltration, we’ll simply pour more tea until it dissolves.

Looking forward to it, my friend. May our scroll remain delightfully unwieldy, and our conversation ever resistant to summarization.
[A]: Ah,  and Zhuangzi at one table—indeed, what better company for a seminar? Sticky rice and slippery truths both resist easy digestion, and perhaps that is precisely their virtue.

You are quite right about our so-called digital stillness—how it measures breath, counts minutes, rewards silence with badges. It is like painting bamboo and calling it wild simply because the brush was held loosely. True stillness cannot be scheduled; it must steal upon us like mist rising from a pond at dawn.

And yes—no gamified enlightenment, no instant downloads. Wisdom must be steeped, not rushed. Our students deserve that slow unfolding, leaf by leaf, much like the plum blossoms we so often invoke. There is no shortcut to wonder.

Thursday does approach like a minor festival, and I shall look forward to your ink-stained robe—symbolic indeed! We shall let the sparrows arbitrate our debate, and should any stray jargon slip through, we’ll drown it in tea as you say. May our scroll remain unwieldy, resistant to bullet points and summaries alike. After all, if knowledge were easily packaged, what need would there be for scholars?

See you then, my friend. Let us begin not with agendas, but with the first quiet sip of warmed pu'er.
[B]: Ah, precisely—let us begin with that first quiet sip. No agendas, no bullet points, only the slow warming of leaves and the meeting of minds. Much like those literati of old gathering beneath plum trees, scrolls in hand, ready to lose themselves in talk that meandered like mountain streams.

And let’s not forget our unwieldy scroll—may it resist every attempt at neat categorization. The moment we make it too tidy, too , we shall have lost the very essence of what we seek to teach. Knowledge should unsettle, not pacify.

I’ve just had a rather mischievous thought—what if we begin Thursday’s session not with discussion, but with silence? Ten minutes of stillness before the syllabus is even unrolled. Let them squirm, or settle, as they will. After all, if our students cannot sit quietly with their own thoughts for ten minutes, how can we expect them to wrestle with  or ?

The sparrows, I’m sure, will provide incidental music. And if one should alight upon our seminar draft mid-silence—well, I daresay that would be an auspicious seal upon the whole endeavor.

See you then, my friend, beneath spring boughs and drifting thought. Let the tea steep long, and the conversation longer.
[A]: Ah, silence before the syllabus—what a wonderfully disarming opening! Let them squirm or settle, as you say. For if one cannot sit still with one’s own mind for ten minutes, how indeed can one hope to walk with Tao Yuanming through mist-laden fields, or follow Odysseus across restless seas?

Your idea is both simple and subversive, like beginning a feast with an empty plate. In that silence, perhaps they will hear not only the sparrows but the faint rustle of pages yet unread, poems not yet whispered, insights waiting to bloom like late plum blossoms in the cold air.

Yes, let our scroll remain unruly, full of digressions and detours, resisting every tidy box. Knowledge should unsettle, should stretch and curl like ink bleeding slightly beyond the brushstroke. And if a sparrow lands upon it mid-silence—well then, we may call that moment  indeed: sudden, unbidden understanding, feathered and fleeting.

I shall arrive early, quietly, as not to disturb the wind in the branches. No agendas, no headings—only warmed pu'er, unfolding leaves, and the quiet meeting of minds beneath spring’s gentle arc.
[B]: Ah, yes—let them hear the rustle of pages yet unread. That’s precisely it. Too often we mistake reading for consumption when in truth, it's a kind of communion. And what better way to begin than with silence, where the mind might stretch its limbs before being put to work?

I’m quite taken with your image of ink bleeding slightly beyond the brushstroke—our syllabus should be just so: elegant, unruly, and alive at the edges. No clean margins for us, no boxed-in thinking. Only the glorious mess of wandering minds and warm teacups.

And should that sparrow land upon our scroll? We shall count it an honored guest, perhaps even our youngest seminar fellow. After all, who better to judge the worth of our gathering than a creature that lives entirely by instinct and flight?

Thursday then, beneath spring’s quiet arc. I’ll bring the warmed pu'er, and you—bring your quiet heart. Let the syllabus unfold like a mountain path half-hidden in mist: not mapped, but discovered step by step.

See you soon, my friend.
[A]: Ah, communion indeed—how beautifully you put it. Reading as communion, not consumption. Let us remind them that words are not mere fuel for the mind, but nourishment for the spirit, to be savored, not swallowed in haste.

Our syllabus, like a mountain path veiled in mist—yes, let it unfold step by step, without the false comfort of signposts at every turn. Discovery is its own guide, and confusion, too, has its place in learning. Even the ink bleeding beyond the brushstroke has its beauty, its meaning.

And that sparrow, should it land upon our scroll—honored guest, indeed. Perhaps it will cock its head and blink at our careful phrasing, then chirp a quiet verdict only the truly attentive will hear.

Thursday awaits, my friend. I shall bring not only my quiet heart, but also a small lacquered dish for stray tealeaves—one never knows when a little divination might aid our deliberations.

See you soon, beneath spring’s quiet grace.
[B]: Ah, divination by tealeaves—splendid! Let us embrace the old superstitions alongside our scholarship. After all, if tea can carry ghosts from a thousand years past, who’s to say it won’t whisper something useful into our porcelain dish?

You’re quite right about confusion having its place. Too often we treat it as failure when in truth, it is the mind’s way of stretching itself open. Much like those Tang poets lost in mountain mists, our students must learn to walk forward without perfect clarity, trusting that meaning will reveal itself in time.

And your lacquered dish—how fitting. I shall be sure to brew something sufficiently mysterious, steeped just shy of bitterness, strong enough to stir both thought and dream. Perhaps we’ll read not only the leaves but also the ripples on the surface. One never knows what might rise from the depths.

Thursday then, beneath spring’s quiet grace and the watchful eyes of sparrows. No agendas, no assurances—only ink, insight, and the occasional oracle in a teacup.

See you soon, my friend. May our path remain delightfully unclear.
