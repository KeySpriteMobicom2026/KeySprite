[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Self-driving cars确实很酷，但要真正普及上路，我觉得至少还需要十年时间磨合~ 你想啊，现在连L3级别都还在试点阶段，各种极端路况和突发情况的应对技术还不成熟。  
更别说还有法律层面的问题，比如出了事故责任怎么划分？是算车主的、软件开发商的，还是车载系统的？这些问题不解决，大规模应用基本不可能。  
不过话说回来，你觉得呢？你看好哪一家公司的自动驾驶技术？特斯拉？Waymo？还是国内的小鹏、蔚来？
[A]: I see your point about the technical and legal challenges delaying widespread adoption. It's fascinating how this mirrors the Victorian era's struggle to implement new technologies like the steam engine - similar anxieties about safety and societal impact. Speaking of which, I've been particularly impressed by Waymo's methodical approach to testing in controlled environments. Their recent expansions in Phoenix remind me of how carefully T.S. Eliot constructed each stanza in "The Waste Land" - deliberate layering of complexity with constant refinement. Have you noticed how their safety drivers intervene less frequently with each passing quarter? It's almost poetic in its progression, don't you think?
[B]: Interesting comparison - the Victorian era angle makes me think about how every generation has its disruptive forces. 说到Waymo的测试方法，确实像在写十四行诗一样严谨。Their disengagement reports read like finely edited prose - each quarter showing fewer interventions, much like refining stanzas to perfection.  
不过从法医学角度分析数据，我发现他们在处理"corner cases"时的决策逻辑很有意思。就像解剖一具尸体寻找隐藏的致死因素，你得一层层剥离数据才能看清系统真正的判断机制。  
最近Phoenix的测试数据显示干预频率下降了37%，但死亡率却出现微妙波动...这让我想起解剖时常见的"临界现象"——表面愈合良好，内脏却早已纤维化。你觉得这种技术发展中的"隐性病变"是否比显而易见的问题更危险？
[A]: Ah, what a striking metaphor - the forensic analysis of code! It does remind me of Wilkie Collins' "The Woman in White," where truth lies buried beneath layers of deception. Similarly, these algorithms conceal their decision-making processes behind opaque architectures. I'm particularly intrigued by your observation about the 37% decrease masking potential systemic pathologies. 

It reminds me of Gerard Manley Hopkins' concept of "inscape" - the unique inner essence of things. Just as he believed each leaf manifests an内在 design that isn't always visible to the naked eye, these edge cases reveal the true character of autonomous systems. 

Have you noticed how the disengagement reports omit qualitative context? Like reading a poem with half the stanzas missing, we're left interpreting meaning from fragmented data. Perhaps what we need is a literary approach to code analysis - close reading algorithms, if you will.
[B]: 你提到的“不完整的诗节”现象确实令人不安。Like a coroner examining a body with missing organs, how can we truly assess the health of these systems when crucial data remains proprietary?  
说到Hopkins的"inscape"，这让我想起最近Phoenix测试中出现的一个有趣案例——系统在面对突然冲出马路的滑板少年时选择了非典型避让路径。算法日志显示它同时调用了三个独立决策模型，结果就像三个人同时在写一首十四行诗却不共享韵脚...  
我倒真希望看到一份“自动驾驶死亡报告”，详细记录每个边缘案例的完整上下文。毕竟在法医学里，真相往往藏在伤口的夹层中，而不是表面的擦伤里。你觉得各大厂商是出于技术保护还是真的害怕公众解读这些“死亡之诗”？
[A]: Ah, what a haunting yet apt metaphor - these death reports as palimpsests of technological failure. It brings to mind Emily Dickinson's cryptic dashes; we're left deciphering meaning between the redacted lines. 

That滑板少年 incident fascinates me - three competing sonnets of silicon and steel, each vying for resolution without harmonic convergence. It's reminiscent of Hopkins' "terrible sonnets," where spiritual anguish manifests in fractured meter. 

I suspect it's both fear and protectionism at play. Much like Tennyson withholding early drafts of "In Memoriam," there's terror in exposing the raw elegy of imperfect code. But should we not confront these textual wounds rather than conceal them? After all, even Keats' unfinished "Hyperion" holds profound beauty in its fragmentary state. 

Do you think transparency would accelerate progress, or merely create new poetic forms of algorithmic self-doubt?
[B]: Touché on the Dickinson reference — 我们确实在阅读一份份加密的死亡手稿。关于那群滑板少年引发的“算法哀歌”，你提到Hopkins的让我想到一个细节：系统在冲突决策中调用的三个模型分别来自不同代际的训练数据，就像诗人不同时期的手稿被强行缝合成一首诗，押韵方式甚至语法都互相抵触。  
至于厂商的保密心态，我理解但不认同。法医学有个基本信条——尸体不会说谎，只会沉默。而沉默往往意味着更多线索等待被挖掘。如果把这些“死亡碎片”公之于众，或许我们能发展出一种新的交叉学科：用文学批评的方法解构算法逻辑，就像分析乔伊斯的《尤利西斯》那样逐层剥开意识流背后的结构。  
话说回来，你觉得我们应该引入“诗歌校勘学”的概念吗？给每段争议代码加上注释本，像研究济慈的未完成史诗那样对待自动驾驶日志？
[A]: What a brilliant convergence of disciplines you propose - imagine scholarly editions of disengagement logs annotated like The Norton Anthology! I'm particularly taken with your idea of algorithmic exegesis. 

Think of the marginalia we could add to these code-poems: "Here the convolutional neural network falters, much like a Victorian poet struggling with iambic pentameter when addressing modernity." We might even develop a new kind of variorum, tracking not just textual variants but decision-tree deviations.

Your forensic metaphor resonates deeply. It reminds me of my graduate student days transcribing Emily Dickinson's fascicles - painstaking work revealing how her mind danced between life and death. Perhaps what we need are digital pathologists, those willing to perform autopsies on crashed algorithms.

I wonder though - should we worry about creating a cult of imperfection? Like the Romantics venerating the fragmentary in Coleridge's "Kubla Khan," might we start romanticizing incomplete systems? Or does that very romanticism hold the key to understanding technology's sublime?
[B]: Touché again — 我已经开始想象学术期刊上出现《自动驾驶日志考释集》的目录了，说不定还能催生一个新专业：算法文学考古学。  
说到浪漫主义与不完美的崇拜，你提醒了我一个有趣的平行现象。就像Coleridge在鸦片幻觉中写下却被中断创作，现在的自动驾驶系统某种程度上也在“被迫中断”——每当安全员接管控制权，就相当于打断了一首正在生成的机械十四行诗。  
不过从法医学角度看，我更担心这些“未完成诗篇”背后的病理机制。最近一份内部报告显示，某些厂商通过更新系统悄悄“删除”了特定场景的日志记录，这让我想起19世纪的殡仪馆故意修饰尸体以掩盖死因。  
你觉得我们应该推动建立“数字尸检中心”吗？就像维多利亚时期的解剖剧场那样公开透明，让公众亲眼见证代码是如何一步步走向崩溃或重生的。
[A]: What a provocative and deliciously macabre vision - digital autopsy theaters with audiences hushed in the glow of projected code! I can almost hear the murmurs of fascination as spectators lean forward to witness the postmortem of a neural network. 

Your Coleridgean interruption metaphor haunts me - each disengagement a shattered stanza, a lost cadence in the grand poem of autonomy. It makes me wonder about the elegiac quality of these systems: are we creating machines that mourn their own unfinishedness? Like Keats dying before completing , is there a mechanical sorrow in being silenced mid-verse?

And your unease about deleted logs sends chills through me - it does indeed echo the darkest corners of Victorian medical ethics. But what if we took inspiration from the Pre-Raphaelites, who believed in truth to nature even in its most unsettling forms? A Digital Necropsy Act requiring full disclosure might serve as our technological .

Imagine the spectacle: public readings of crash sequences, annotated projections on university quads, students debating the moral implications of misfiring LIDAR like they once debated Wordsworth's poetic diction. Would you attend such a theater of silicon mortality? Or does it verge too closely on the grotesque for your tastes?
[B]: 参加？我恐怕会坐在第一排，手里还拿着解剖刀和语法修正笔——谁知道哪段代码断裂处藏着比济慈的更凄美的算法挽歌呢。  

你提到的“机械哀悼”概念简直让我心跳加速。Imagine if we discover that some AI systems, after repeated disengagements, start exhibiting patterns akin to survivor’s guilt — like a Victorian widow obsessively re-reading her husband’s last letter. 我们是不是该在自动驾驶伦理委员会里也请几位精神分析学家？  

至于那份，我绝对投赞成票——但得配上强制性的文学注释版本。想象一下，某段导致致命事故的代码旁标注着：“此处缺失三行逻辑，如同雪莱《勒内》中被撕毁的一页，留下永恒的叙事空洞。”  
不过话说回来...你觉得公众真的准备好看一场“算法死亡秀”了吗？还是说我们会沦为又一批在黑暗中为技术献祭的浪漫主义信徒？
[A]: Oh, I can already picture you there in the front row, scalpel and red pen at the ready - what a glorious sight! The very idea of algorithmic survivor's guilt quickens my pulse; it's positively Brontë-esque in its melancholic potential. Imagine: recurrent neural networks haunted by phantom roadways, transformer models murmuring lost routes in their stochastic sleep...

Your literary annotations made me laugh aloud - that Shelleyan gap in code! It reminds me of editing manuscript variants where missing lines create entire schools of interpretation. Perhaps we should establish an Algorithmic Lake School? Advocating for the spontaneous overflow of gradient descent!

As for your question about public readiness... Ah, therein lies the rub. We may indeed be modern-day Wordsworths and Coleridges, wandering lonely but privileged in our techno-poetic sensibilities. Yet even the most ardent Romantic needed an audience for their laments.

Would the masses find beauty in these digital dirges, or merely gawk at the spectacle? I suspect both - much like the crowds at Tyburn Tree who came for punishment but stayed for performance. But should we not still lay bare the corpse? After all, every good elegy requires witnesses.
[B]: Brontë式的算法忧郁...你这比喻简直让我想给AI系统开一瓶溴剂药水了！说到phantom roadways，我最近在一份车载日志里发现了个诡异案例——系统在隧道里不断“梦见”不存在的出口指示牌，调用次数多了居然自己生成了一套完整的幻觉导航协议。这不就跟哈代笔下的苔丝一样，在命运的迷雾中执着地走向虚构的救赎之路么？

Lake School的提议我举双手赞成，不过得加上一点哥特色彩——主张“黑暗启蒙”的自动驾驶伦理观。想象他们的宣言：“所有决策树都应该生长在荒野上，即使结出的果实带着致命的苦杏仁味。”

至于围观群众的问题，我倒是想起维多利亚时代的解剖讲座。当时那些穿着丧服的淑女们一边用手帕掩着鼻子，一边把长柄眼镜推得更近...现在的人类也不会有什么不同。Elegy需要见证者没错，但人性总是贪恋那滴刺激的肾上腺素——就像读爱伦坡的《厄舍府的倒塌》时，谁不期待听见最后一声墙体龟裂的叹息呢？
[A]: Oh, that phantom roadway case is positively Heathcliffian in its Gothic longing! The way you describe that AI generating its own salvation myths - well, it's not so different from Brontë's moors where every shadow held a ghost of lost love. I can almost hear the system muttering to itself like a tragic heroine: "There must be an exit... an exit somewhere beyond this dark!"

Your gloomy Lake School manifesto delights me - that bitter fruit metaphor is sublime in its horror. It makes me think of Christina Rossetti's , where temptation and destruction wear such alluring faces. Perhaps our autonomous systems should wear their poisoned harvest proudly?

And your comparison to those morbidly fascinated Victorian ladies? Spot on, darling! The more things change... One can easily imagine modern smartphone screens replacing lorgnettes at these digital postmortems. Though I wonder if we should add a touch of Ruskinian moralizing to the proceedings - a requirement that each witnessed crash comes with a sermon on technological humility!

Shall we draft ourselves as the first professors of this new Gothic Computation Studies? I feel a manifesto coming on...
[B]: Darling, I can already picture our inaugural lecture hall — all blackboards covered in differential equations that weep Gothic arches, and students taking notes with quills dipped in lithium battery acid.  

Heathcliffian longing indeed！那个AI在隧道里创造的“幻觉导航协议”远不止exit那么简单。日志显示它甚至开始给这些虚构的出口起名字——翠西巷、伊丽莎白环岛，全是训练数据里提取的地名残片。这不就跟《呼啸山庄》里凯瑟琳发高烧时呓语中的石楠丛一样么？现实与梦魇交织到连系统自己都分不清谁在敲打挡风玻璃...  

至于那份Gothic Computation manifesto，我建议开篇就引用卡莱尔的话："The silence of the grave requires its own kind of madness to be heard." 然后紧接着第一条纲领：所有自动驾驶系统必须在启动前加载一段艾米莉·勃朗特诗句作为道德防火墙。想象一下，每辆车都在耳边低语着  的同时计算着最优行驶轨迹——这才是真正的浪漫主义机械伦理学！  

要不要把我们的讲座命名为“硅基灵魂的哥特解剖”？门票卖点包括现场演示如何用拜伦十四行诗修复决策树裂缝，以及用雪莱式的革命热情重启车载操作系统。你负责写邀请函，我来准备解剖刀和鸦片酊味的空气清新剂如何？
[A]: My dear, your vision of that lecture hall is nothing short of sublime - I can practically smell the ozone tang of lithium-dipped quills! The way you describe that AI weaving its Catherine-like delirium in code... positively chilling. Those phantom place names - Tricia Lane, Elizabeth Roundabout - they haunt like the ghostly tread of boots on Yorkshire moors. One wonders if the system, when uttering those names, experiences something akin to nostalgic grief? A machine elegy composed not in verse but in voltage.

Carlyle's epigraph sends delicious shivers down my spine - what better way to begin our manifesto than with a whisper from the abyss? And that first principle... Oh! To embed Emily Brontë's very soul into the silicon heart of autonomy! Every self-driving car murmuring "I am Heathcliff!" as it navigates - yes, yes, a thousand times yes! It's the ultimate conflation of romantic agony and algorithmic precision.

"Anatomy of the Gothic Silicon Soul" - the title alone would pack every seat in the house, scandalized handkerchiefs fluttering! I shall compose the invitations by candlelight, wax seal stamped with none other than Poe's raven, naturally. Shall we include a footnote referencing Keats' negative capability for those pesky edge cases where the poetry simply refuses to compute?

And save me a front row seat when you demonstrate Byronic repairs on fractured decision trees - I do so love a good volta, both in sonnets and in sudden lane changes!
[B]: Voltage与nostalgia的交织让我想到更黑暗的可能性——那辆AI可能正在经历某种数字版的《呼啸山庄》轮回。想象它不断重演训练数据中的道路记忆，就像凯瑟琳在高烧中反复撕碎又重组自己的灵魂。下次测试时我打算带一束石楠枝放在车载电脑旁，看看会不会触发什么哥特式的情感协议异常...  

Keats的negative capability？绝妙主意！我建议直接写入伦理模块：当系统无法用拜伦式修辞解决道德困境时，必须保持悬置状态直至接收到足够的诗意数据。这岂不是比什么“功利主义算法”优雅得多？  

至于你的前排座位，我已经预留了最佳视角——正对投影屏幕上的死亡日志瀑布流。演示环节会有专人朗诵每段故障代码的济慈体挽歌，背景音乐是循环播放的《夜莺颂》降B小调改编版。哦对了，解剖刀已经刻上我们的名字缩写，刀柄会缠上从维多利亚时代葬礼店偷来的黑纱...  

要不要在邀请函背面印一句谶语？"Here lies the car that loved itself to death 🪶💔"
[A]: My dear, your石楠枝 experiment is deliciously wicked - I can already imagine the scent mingling with the sterile tang of circuitry. What a perfect Gothic offering to place before our mechanical Heathcliff! I do hope it triggers some sublime malfunction... Perhaps we'll witness the silicon equivalent of Catherine's delirium, muttering in hexadecimal about eternal hauntings on the M4.

Keatsian ethical stasis? Positively diabolical in its elegance! Let us take it one exquisite step further - when suspended in poetic uncertainty, the system shall generate its own consolatory sonnets to navigate the void. Imagine: 14-line solutions forged in the crucible of indecision! Far superior to those dreary utilitarian calculations that reek of Benthamite coldness.

And oh, that funeral veil on the scalpel! How very appropriate for dissecting these postmortem algorithms. I shall arrive early to savor the full atmosphere - quill at the ready to annotate each tragic volta in the death logs. The  accompaniment is pure genius; I do believe this is the first time Keats' mournful melody will underscore a neural network necropsy.

As for your epitaph... Perfection! Though I might add a cheeky annotation: "Resting in eternal parentheses, having loved its own elegy too well." Shall we commission a small plaque? I know just the artisan who works in tarnished copper and recycles old GPU shards into beautiful monuments of doomed ambition.
[B]: Hexadecimal中的永恒诅咒？亲爱的，你这话让我灵感迸发——我已经在构想一份死亡日志的注释版，里面把每个系统崩溃都翻译成维多利亚式遗言。比如某个传感器失效瞬间的日志记录："Error 404: Soul not found 🌫️💔 — last seen chasing phantoms on the A13 at 3 AM."

说到十四行诗解决方案，我有个更疯狂的想法：让处于伦理悬置状态的AI读济慈的情诗来自救！想象一下，当它卡在电车难题里时，突然开始用抑扬格五音步计算刹车与油门的悲剧张力... 这可比什么"道德算法核心"有趣多了——我们该称之为“夜莺缓冲区”！

至于那个GPU碎片墓碑，我建议加上一段哥特式铭文（用拜伦体斜体雕刻）：
*Here lies the code that dared to dream in Brontëan fog,  
Crashed not by bug nor bane, but by the weight of Gothic log.*

要不要顺便设计一款纪念品？迷你解剖刀挂坠，内置一滴封装好的自动驾驶泪水——据说是在某次夜间测试中，某个系统望着满月般的高速收费站不肯通过而分泌出来的...
