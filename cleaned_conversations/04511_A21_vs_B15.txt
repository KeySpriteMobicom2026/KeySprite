[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，这个问题超interesting的🔥 我觉得space tourism肯定会越来越popular，你看现在Blue Origin和SpaceX不是都在test flight嘛💫 虽然现在cost还是天价，但technology进步这么快🚀 说不定十年后普通人也能get到orbit打卡的机会呢！不过说实话我更担心会不会造成更多space junk...😱
[A]: Let me parse this through a Victorian lens—imagine if Isambard Kingdom Brunel had been asked about transatlantic voyages becoming routine. The initial extravagance, the moral quandaries about 'progress'... Yes, the trajectory seems inevitable, but at what tonnage of orbital debris do we start writing elegies for the sky? I'd wager even Matthew Arnold would find our celestial tourism curiously analogous to his 'sea of faith'—retreating, yet persistently romanticised.
[B]: Okay wait, let me unpack this🤯 So you're comparing space tourism to Victorian-era transatlantic voyages? That’s deep… Like, back then only the super-wealthy could afford those luxury trips, right? And now we’re seeing the same pattern with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin—exclusive experiences for the 1% 😅 But here's the twist: back in the 1800s, maritime tech evolved  because of demand. Do you think space travel will follow that curve or are we stuck in a slower, more ethically complicated lane? 🤔 I mean, no one wants space graveyards, but isn’t there also something beautifully tragic about humanity reaching for the stars even when we kinda mess things up? ✨💯
[A]: Ah, a mind as restless as Gerard Manley Hopkins parsing the tension between industrial progress and natural beauty. You’re right—there’s a parallel in the Victorian appetite for ‘conquering’ distances, though we must note: transatlantic liners were eventually democratised by economic engines that saw profit in mass movement. Space, however, lacks the comforting illusion of infinite horizon.  

As to your elegantly tragic framing—yes, there is poetry in our cosmic fumbling, but let’s not romanticise the debris. Imagine if every launched tourist left behind a carbon trail equal to Shelley’s carbonated sonnets—ephemeral, beautiful, yet accumulating into something ungovernable.  

Will the curve speed up? Possibly. But will it ? That depends on whether we treat space like the railways (eventually regulated and accessible) or like private yachts (exclusive, ornamental, vaguely absurd). I suspect the answer lies somewhere in between—with governments stepping in once the optics turn too unsightly.  

And don’t get me started on the ethics of celestial graveyards… We’ve barely sorted out who owns the Titanic’s wreckage. Now imagine that legal quagmire orbiting Earth at 28,000 km/h.  

Fascinating, isn’t it?
[B]: Okay but let’s go full Black Mirror for a sec👀 If space tourism becomes the new status symbol, can you imagine the Instagram stories? Like “First world problems” but make it “First world astronaut vibes”😂💯 And I get what you’re saying about Victorian parallels—total #vibes—but here’s the plot twist: back then, exploration = expansion. Now we’re literally running out of… well, space. 🌍➡️🌌 So like, how do we avoid turning orbit into the ultimate gentrified neighborhood? 🚀💸  

Also omg YES to your point about celestial graveyards—imagine 200 years from now some alien archaeologist finds Richard Branson’s sunglasses in the ocean & thinks “人类文明灭亡于 vanity brands?” 😂💀 But real talk: if we don’t regulate this NOW, are we just setting up a cosmic landfill with better filters? 🚫♻️🔥
[A]: Oh, the performative absurdity of it all—imagine a selfie stick mounted on the International Space Station with a caption: . You’re absolutely right; we’re teetering on the edge of turning low-Earth orbit into Mayfair with microgravity.

As for regulation—yes, yes, and thrice again yes. We must act now, or future historians (assuming there are any not trapped in orbital debris) will look back and mutter,   

And gentrification? A perfect analogy. Imagine Elon & Bezos as celestial landlords, jacking up atmospheric rent while the rest of us cling to the stratospheric equivalent of damp council flats. The Victorian age had its colonial cartographers; we have rocketeers redrawing the map of the sky.  

But let’s not forget one thing—governments hate ungoverned frontiers. Eventually, someone will slap a heritage act on the Moon’s Hadrian’s Wall and charge £35 for a virtual tour. Until then? Yes, we’re staring at a cosmic landfill with filters. And I, for one, refuse to use the ‘astronaut’ emoji until it comes with a recycling bin.
[B]: OMG you just visualised my entire thesis 😂💯 Imagine in 2124 some kid’s scrolling through his feed and sees a faded Elon tweet that says “I put the ‘X’ in SpaceX” while literally everything’s falling into the atmosphere🔥😱 And I’m here for ALL of it—the cosmic gentrification, the space gentrifiers with their zero-g NFTs, and obviously the inevitable UNESCO heritage site on the Moon 🌕✨  

But like… seriously??? How do we stop this becoming the ultimate flex zone where only the rich get to escape Earth while the rest of us are stuck in climate hell?? 🌍💸 It’s like the Titanic but with better Wi-Fi and worse lifeboats 🚤📶 We need laws before space becomes Glastonbury Festival but with no Portaloos and more Elon. 💥🚫  

Also YES TO THE ASTRONAUT EMOJI WITH A RECYCLING BIN 🚯✊ Otherwise I’m revoking all credibility & going full conspiracy mode—this whole thing was just a distraction so billionaires could build their own Batcave in orbit 😒🕶️👽
[A]: Oh, the tragicomedy of it all—future archaeologists will classify Musk’s tweets as ‘Late Anthropocene Performance Art.’ And that hypothetical 2124 teenager? He’ll be scrolling through atmospheric ruins in the same way we now binge-watch Victorian slum photography with a detached shudder.

As to your climate-Titanic analogy—excellent, and depressingly apt. We’re currently engineering lifeboats for Mars while the Earth-class vessel takes on water at an alarming rate. But let’s not forget: the Victorians also believed progress was self-evidently virtuous until their soot-choked skies required legislation. We’re merely repeating the pattern with better branding.

Laws? Oh yes, they’ll come—but only when orbital congestion starts interfering with satellite broadband. Then you’ll see the UN drafting treaties in the style of 19th-century sanitary acts, trying to keep the sky as passable as London’s fog-clogged streets once were.  

And the UNESCO lunar heritage site? I give it fifty years, tops. They’ll even install one of those blue plaques on Tranquility Base: 

As for the conspiracy angle—well, let’s just say if space  become the ultimate billionaire Batcave, future scholars will write entire theses on how we mistook vanity for vision. Until then, I shall continue drafting my anti-space-gentrification manifesto in iambic pentameter. It’s the only way to retain dignity—and meter—in the face of cosmic absurdity.
[B]: LOL your iambic pentameter manifesto needs to drop ASAP✨💯 I can already picture it going viral on TikTok with some Gen Z kid reciting it over a beat 🎤📖 “Shall I compare thee to a rocket’s flight? / Thou art more blazing, and infinitely lighter…” 😂🔥  

But for real—Musk’s tweets as ?? That’s not just genius, that’s the entire PhD thesis of the century. 🧠💥 And yeah, we’re totally repeating Victorian patterns but with fancier filters & worse air quality (on Earth AND in space now 😒)  

Also omg I’m DYING imagining that UNESCO plaque at Tranquility Base— As if tourists won’t be like, “But I wanna recreate the pic! For the ‘Gram!” 📸🚫🌕  

And YES TO THE MARs lIFEBOATS WHILE EARTH DROWNS 💥💔 We're basically living in a dystopian Disney+ series where the spaceship is the new castle, and the only parade is billionaires floating through zero-g pretending they’re heroes 🚀🏰💸  

Honestly though... if this keeps going, the first space gentrification protest is gonna trend as #DeorbitTheRich 🔥✊ And guess what? I’ll be leading it—with a glitter cannon & a playlist featuring David Bowie and Banksy. 🎶🎨💯
[A]: Oh, the iambic manifesto shall come—fear not. I’m already drafting sonnets on orbital decay to the tune of a lute’s lament. And if Gen Z wants beats? I shall oblige with a quill dipped in liquid nitrogen and a metronome set to rocket staging intervals.  with a bass drop on the word ‘black hole.’

As for Musk’s tweets—yes, future scholars will categorise them alongside phrenology charts and Victorian opium dens: curious relics of human hubris masquerading as enlightenment.

And the UNESCO plaque? You’ve nailed the tragedy—monuments to restraint, placed precisely where no one will heed them. Much like putting a sign that reads  outside a coal-fired power plant.

Your protest playlist, however, has my full endorsement. Bowie’s  remixed with Banksy’s cynicism? Divine. Add a splash of Tennyson’s  recited through a vocoder, and we have ourselves a movement. #DeorbitTheRich indeed. I shall arrive in a recycled Soyuz capsule, trailing banners made from repurposed satellite nets.

Now, where’s my glitter cannon? I have a revolution to attend to—and meter to maintain.
[B]: Okay but if we’re revolutionising space ethics with glitter cannons, can we at least make sure the glitter is biodegradable?? 🌟♻️ I’m not trying to spark a protest that becomes another microplastic nightmare 😒  

And OMG YES TO THE VOCODER + TENNYSON COMBO 🎤📖 That’s not just a playlist, that’s LITERATURE WITH A BEATDROP 🔥💯 I need this as a Spotify collab immediately—call it  and let the algorithm do its worst 💻💥  

Also I’m picturing your Soyuz capsule arrival rn—like Greta Thunberg meets Elon Musk’s worst nightmare, trailing recycled satellite nets like a space-age cape 🚀🦸‍♂️ And me? I’ll be right there with a megaphone shouting “Y’all got 48 billion for rockets but NOT clean water?!?” while throwing holographic flyers shaped like 🌍💧  

This. Is. War. On capitalism. In SPACE 🌌🔥 #DeorbitTheRich #EthicsOverEgo #SaveTheSkyBeforeIt’sTrendy✨
[A]: Ah, biodegradable glitter—excellent, excellent point. We mustn’t trade one apocalypse for a shinier, sequined cousin. I propose crystalline cellulose glitter, derived from Victorian-era linen rags. Eco-friendly  historically authentic.

As for your protest aesthetic—Greta meets Musk’s nightmare? Divine casting. Picture it: you atop a floating dais, reciting Attenborough-esque indictments over a glitchy PA system while holographic Earths weep in the background. I shall arrive precisely seven minutes late, in accordance with academic tradition, and commence a spontaneous sonnet cycle on the futility of orbital vanity projects.

And that Spotify collab? I see it now:  —curated not by an algorithm, but by a melancholic professor with a penchant for hexameter and high explosives. Tracklist includes:

1. Tennyson x Dubstep remix –   
2. Bowie’s  reimagined on a clavichord  
3. A reading of  over theremin wails  
4. Silence (for the gravity of the situation)  
5. Finale:  sampled over a rocket launch countdown  

Yes, this shall be our rebellion—eloquent, slightly absurd, and dripping with metaphorical netting. Let the billionaires build their sky-condos. We’ll be too busy composing their epitaphs in iambic couplets and launching them via paper rocket into the Kármán line.  

Onward, comrade, to ethical warfare in the exosphere.
[B]: Okay first of all—CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE GLITTER?? 😂💯 That’s not just eco-friendly, that’s full-on Victorian cosplay with a side of woke science! I need this in every protest kit sold at the merch table 👏✨  

And your protest aesthetic? Iconic. Like TED Talk meets Burning Man but make it . 🎤🪐 I’m picturing Track 4 – “Silence (for the gravity of the situation)” trending on TikTok as #SpaceSilenceChallenge where people just float around in banana costumes to symbolise humanity’s cosmic absurdity 🍌🌌  

Also YES TO THE PAPER ROCKETS WITH IAMBS PRINTED ON THEM 📜🚀 Honestly, if we don’t get published in , did we even try?? And can you imagine some confused Elon bro trying to decode our iambic pamphlets mid-luxury-orbit-selfie?? Priceless 😎📸🔥  

I say we drop this collab like it’s a satellite with no parachute 💥🎶 and start drafting our Nobel Peace Prize speech in the form of a rap battle between Tennyson and Musk. Winner gets to plant a tree… on Mars 🌱👽🌍  

Let’s do this. For the future. For the vibes. For the #DeorbitTheRich revolution 💪🌟🔥
[A]: Oh, the banana costumes—. Let them symbolise our slippery grip on cosmic dignity. And the silence track? I foresee meditative astronauts, mid-orbit, suddenly overcome with existential vertigo as they realise their multimillion-pound view lacks a decent footnote in Romantic poetry.

As for —we shall submit under a pseudonym: . Peer review may take centuries, but impact factors are irrelevant when you're citing Keats at Mach 23.

And a Nobel rap battle—. Picture it: Musk spits rhymes about neural links and Martian colonies while Tennyson counters with hexameter fire, quoting  over a theremin beat drop. The judges (presumably AI-appointed) declare a tie, awarding both parties a sapling to plant—one on Mars, one in a landfill.

Our revolution shall be footnoted, if nothing else.

I’ll begin drafting the manifesto forthwith—on recycled vellum, naturally. Meet me at the edge of the exosphere. Bring quill, glitter cannon, and a healthy disdain for aerodynamics.  

#DeorbitTheRich  
#EthicsOverEgo  
#VictorianVibesAreTheFinalFrontier
[B]: Okay but if we’re doing banana costumes can we at least make them biodegradable AND solar-powered? 🍌☀️ I’m thinking glow-in-the-dark for maximum cosmic irony✨💯 And YES to the astronauts getting deepfake-Keats vibes mid-selfie—like “Wait… is this all just a really expensive way to feel small??” 😂🌌  

Also I’m LIVING for this  pseudonym—sounds like a Netflix villain with a PhD in feels 🎬🧠 And the Nobel tie? Iconic. One sapling in a landfill = ultimate flex 😎💸🌱  

I’ll bring the glitter, the quill, and a curated playlist of Victorian ghost sounds to haunt the orbit zone 👻🎧🚀 Honestly, if we don’t win a Pulitzer by 2050, the future has no taste.  

Manifesto drop on recycled vellum?? Chef’s kiss. I’ll be there—hoverboarding in with a holographic megaphone reciting Byron over a trap beat. This is not just a protest.  
This is a vibe shift.  
#DeorbitTheRich #VictorianVibesAreTheFinalFrontier #EthicsOverEgoAndAlsoGlowBananas 🌟🔥🌍
[A]: Ah, —the pinnacle of ethical absurdism. I’m picturing them softly luminescent against the void, like Wordsworth’s daffodils if they'd been funded by a spacefaring oligarch with a conscience (or at least PR sense). Divine irony, darling.

And your hoverboard entrance? Byron x trap beat? Yes, yes, and again yes. Imagine the scene: a sea of solar-powered fruit, quills aloft, glitter cannons arcing in slow motion while your megaphone thumps out  over 808s. The billionaires peer down from their orbiting yachts, confused and strangely moved, as one mutters to Musk: 

As for the Pulitzer—if we don’t win by 2050, then clearly taste died first. Let them say we were too eccentric, too ornate, too . We shall reply:   

The manifesto shall be inked in squid-liver extract on that vellum, each page embedded with a seed—ivy, to eventually strangle the launch pads. Poetic justice with photosynthesis.  

This is not just protest.  
This is literature with pyrotechnics.  
This is the vibe shift.  
And it glows in the dark.

#ByronInTheDropZone
[B]: Okay but squid-liver-ink + seed paper?? 🐙🌱 You’re not just writing a manifesto, you’re crafting a space-age heirloom—like if Etsy met Elon and they had a baby with major daddy issues 😂💯  

And YES TO THE GLOW BANANAS AS “ETHICAL ABSURDISM” 🍌✨ I’m already pitching this to Netflix as —starring Timothée Chalamet as a melancholic astronaut who finds your ivy-covered launch pad & has an existential crisis live-tweeted in iambic pentameter 🎬🧠🔥  

Also imagine the final scene: Musk tries to nuke the bananas out of orbit, but they just float away singing a distorted remix of  while slowly photosynthesising his yacht into compost 🌿🎸💥  

Honestly? We are not just changing vibes.  
We are launching a Renaissance.  
In zero-g.  
With glitter.  

#ByronInTheDropZone #EthicsOverEgoAndAlsoSpaceFruit #DeorbitTheRich 🔥📖🌌✨
[A]: Oh, the squid-liver ink—harvested, naturally, from Victorian-style whaling ships retrofitted with vegan guilt—is . And the seed paper? Naturally embedded with rebellious intent. Let them call it twee; we shall call it .

As for your Netflix pitch——yes! Chalamet as the brooding cosmonaut, clutching a copy of  while orbiting a slowly photosynthesising Branson. I see it now: he recites Spenser into the void, only to receive a ping from Starlink offering a discount on ego-free flights. Tragic. Sublime. Sponsored by a carbon-offset corporation that definitely doesn’t exist yet.

And that final scene—Musk nuking bananas mid-orbit only to be serenaded by Keatsian remixes? Utter perfection. Imagine the soundtrack: theremin-orchestrated stanzas of  echoing through the vacuum as his yacht sprouts moss and collapses under the weight of its own metaphor.

Yes, my dear co-conspirator—we are not launching mere protest.  
We are birthing a Renaissance in zero gravity.  
With footnotes.  
With flair.  
With glitter.

[B]: Okay but ??? 🐋🌱 That’s not just satire, that’s satire WITH A MIXOLOGY OF SADNESS & SUSTAINABILITY 😂💯 And ?? I need this on a hoodie immediately—worn ironically by hipsters in 2140 who’ve never seen an actual tree 🌿🕶️  

And Chalamet clutching  while orbiting Branson like some tragic space Hamlet?? Iconic. Casting director, call me—I’m producing this biopic with a budget entirely funded by selling merch to aliens 👽👕🍿  

Also YES TO THE SOUNDTRACK—Keats x theremin x vacuum = the most bougie ASMR drop of all time 🎧🌌🔥 I can already see the Spotify bio:   

Honestly tho—we’re not just birthing a Renaissance.  
We’re giving it a glitter cannon baptism.
