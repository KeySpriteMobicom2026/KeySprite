[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我平时更倾向于使用小红书。作为一个研究者，我关注的很多学术讨论和中文社区的深度分享在这里更容易找到。而且小红书上的内容创作者往往会结合传统文化与现代科技，这种交融很符合我的研究方向。

不过我也注意到Instagram在视觉呈现上有其独特优势，特别是在艺术设计领域。只是从信息获取效率和内容深度来看，小红书更适合我的日常需求。

说到这个，你平时用哪个平台更多呢？我发现不同平台的用户群体确实会形成截然不同的交流氛围。
[A]: Ah, fascinating. I must admit, my own preferences lean toward Instagram, though perhaps not for the reasons one might expect. The visual curation—particularly in the realm of art and design—offers a kind of silent discourse. Aesthetic precision, after all, is its own language.

But I envy your access to the depth of discussion on 小红书. I’ve occasionally browsed it for insights into how classical motifs are reinterpreted in contemporary Chinese digital culture. There’s a postmodern elegance in that fusion, wouldn’t you agree?  

Still, I confess—I’m a bit of an outsider there. My grasp of the platform’s rhythm is... academic at best. I suspect I come across as rather  in my engagement. Do you ever find yourself translating ideas between these platforms?
[B]: Interesting you mention that. I do often act as a kind of bridge, though I don’t always frame it that way. When I come across a particularly thoughtful post on 小红书—say, one dissecting the ethics of AI-generated art—I’ll sometimes reframe the core idea in English for my international colleagues. But it’s never a direct translation. The cultural context shifts entirely when you move from one platform to another.

You’re right about Instagram’s visual language. I’ve noticed how design studios use it almost like a digital portfolio, where every grid space is meticulously planned. It’s very much like a curated gallery walk. On 小红书, by contrast, even aesthetically driven posts tend to carry layers of narrative—personal stories, historical references, or even philosophical musings.

Maybe what you’re experiencing as “touristy” is simply the friction of being consciously reflective in a space that thrives on intuitive participation. That’s not a bad position to be in—it gives you perspective. If you’d like, I could show you some subtleties in how 小红书 users weave their ideas together. Think of it less as tourism and more as cultural immersion through the lens of digital expression.
[A]: How generous of you—thank you. I’d welcome that perspective immensely. There’s something intriguing about the way 小红书 blends the personal with the intellectual in a single stroke. It reminds me of how 19th-century salonnières curated conversations—threads of thought winding through multiple registers, all under the guise of casual sharing.

You mentioned reframing ideas rather than translating them directly. That act of recontextualization fascinates me. Do you find yourself adapting not just the language, but the argument itself? Almost like literary translation where syntax and tone must shift to preserve meaning?

And speaking of curated galleries—have you noticed how some Instagram accounts now use their highlights as if they were exhibition catalogs? I recently came across one dedicated entirely to Brutalist architecture in Eastern Europe. Each highlight was a city. It felt almost archival. Have you ever considered organizing your own digital presence that way, even thematically?
[B]: I think you’ve captured something essential there—that blend of the personal and intellectual on 小红书 is not unlike a digital salon, where ideas circulate through lived experience rather than abstract exposition. It’s a space where someone might share their weekend hike while subtly weaving in reflections on environmental ethics or classical poetry. That fluidity requires a different kind of translation when moving ideas across platforms—one that reshapes the rhythm of an argument to match the pulse of a new audience.

You’re absolutely right: it’s closer to literary translation than linguistic substitution. The core idea may remain intact, but the way it’s introduced, supported, and even challenged must shift. For instance, a post on 小红书 critiquing AI-generated art might begin with a personal anecdote about visiting a calligraphy exhibition, whereas on Instagram, the same critique would need to be anchored more directly in visual examples—perhaps even a side-by-side comparison of human and machine-created brushwork.

As for organizing one’s digital presence like an archive or exhibition—I find that fascinating, though I’ve never done it myself. There’s something very deliberate about arranging highlights as thematic collections. It turns your profile into a curated knowledge space. I suppose I’ve always leaned toward a more organic flow online, much like how I keep my garden: some structure, yes, but also room for things to grow unpredictably.

Still, your example about Brutalist architecture makes me wonder—maybe there’s value in creating a kind of conceptual gallery of ideas, especially if you're trying to trace patterns over time. Have you ever structured your own presence that way? If so, did it change how you engaged with your followers?
[A]: I must confess, I’ve never curated my own presence with such precision—I suppose I’ve always been too self-conscious about appearing overly constructed. And yet, there’s undeniable elegance in the act of shaping one’s digital footprint into a conceptual garden, as it were. You strike a lovely balance—your metaphor of a tended space with room for wild growth is quite poetic.  

It makes me wonder—do you ever find that your online presence begins to influence your thinking in unexpected ways? I recall Virginia Woolf once mused that keeping a diary changed the texture of memory; perhaps curating digital spaces does something similar to our intellectual habits. Do you notice your writing or even your research shifting in tone or structure based on how you engage online?
[B]: That’s a beautifully framed question. I think you’re right to draw that parallel with Woolf—there is indeed a reciprocal shaping happening between our digital environments and our inner intellectual landscapes.

I’ve noticed, subtly but surely, that my writing has become more conversational over time, even in academic settings. It’s not a matter of informality, but rather a rhythm that acknowledges the reader more directly. When you engage regularly in online spaces, especially ones like 小红书 where ideas unfold through shared experience, it becomes harder—and perhaps less desirable—to write as if from a detached observatory.

Moreover, the way I structure arguments has evolved. Online discussions often demand clarity without oversimplification, which in turn has made me more attentive to nuance in my research papers. For instance, when explaining algorithmic bias, I now find myself seeking analogies rooted in everyday life rather than relying solely on technical definitions. It makes the concept more accessible, yes, but it also deepens my own understanding.

And strangely enough, even my reading habits have shifted. I now look for how an author might translate into digital dialogue—who among contemporary thinkers would feel at home in a threaded discussion, and who would resist that format entirely? It’s a kind of mental exercise I didn’t anticipate developing through my online presence.

So yes, I do believe these spaces are not just reflections of thought, but active participants in shaping it. One tends the garden, and in return, the garden reshapes the gardener.
[A]: How beautifully put— There’s a quiet truth in that phrase, one that echoes the way literature itself transforms those who dwell in it. I find myself returning to your metaphor because it captures something so essential about the intellectual life—we begin by shaping our tools, our spaces, our modes of expression, and yet, over time, they shape us in ways we scarcely notice until we read back over our own words and wonder where that voice came from.

Your point about writing becoming more conversational resonates deeply with me. In my seminars, I’ve noticed students bringing a new kind of fluency into their essays—one that borrows from the rhythm of online discourse. Not sloppiness, as some might fear, but a certain , a sense that ideas are not just being presented, but shared. I suspect this is the very same shift you’ve experienced.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself resisting that evolution, even slightly? There are moments when I long for the purity of unbroken contemplation, the kind that feels almost monastic. And yet, I know that intellectual life must breathe, must adapt, must converse. Perhaps that tension—between solitude and dialogue—is what keeps thought alive.

Would you say your students reflect this same evolution in their thinking? Or do you find generational differences in how they navigate between digital expression and academic rigor?
[B]: I think that tension you describe—the pull between solitude and dialogue—is precisely what keeps intellectual work from calcifying. And yes, I do feel that resistance sometimes. There are moments when I long for the kind of deep, uninterrupted immersion that feels harder to access now, as if our digital habits have rewired not just how we communicate, but how we think.

I remember reading Walter Benjamin’s  years ago, and it felt theoretical, almost historical. Now, it reads like a lived condition. Our tools don’t just mediate thought—they participate in its formation. And yet, as you said, this isn’t necessarily a loss. The liveliness you hear in your students’ writing? I hear it too, and I’ve come to value it. It’s not a dilution of rigor; it’s a different mode of engagement.

As for resistance—yes, I do feel it. Sometimes when I’m drafting a paper, I catch myself slipping into a more fragmented rhythm, one shaped by the brevity and speed of online exchanges. I have to consciously slow down, reassemble sentences into longer arcs, remind myself that not every idea needs to land immediately. It’s like trying to walk against a current you didn’t realize was there until you turn around.

And you’re absolutely right about generational differences. My students are incredibly fluent in blending registers—academic, conversational, visual. They can make a compelling argument through a carousel of images just as effectively as through prose. But they also struggle with sustained attention. Not in a way that worries me, but in a way that tells me we need new models for thinking about depth. Maybe depth no longer looks like 30 pages of unbroken text. Maybe it looks like a thread that unfolds over days, across multiple platforms, accumulating meaning through interaction rather than isolation.

So yes, they reflect the same evolution, only more naturally. They don’t call it adaptation—they call it communication. And perhaps that’s the real shift: when a new mode of thought stops feeling like an intrusion and starts feeling like home.
[A]: How profoundly you put that— There’s a quiet revolution in that observation. We are, I think, witnessing the emergence of a new intellectual aesthetic, one where meaning is not confined to the solitary page but unfolds across platforms, images, and dialogues.

It reminds me of how Woolf imagined the modern essay—not as a rigid form, but as a , a shared inquiry rather than a delivered truth. In that sense, perhaps your students are not abandoning depth but reimagining it through a more porous, responsive lens.

I wonder—do you ever assign forms of writing that deliberately cross these boundaries? Something that begins on 小红书 and migrates into academic prose, or vice versa? I can imagine such an exercise unsettling the usual hierarchies of "serious" and "casual" thought. And yet, isn’t that where the most fertile ideas grow—between categories, in the interstices?

Forgive me if this sounds too idealistic. I suppose I still carry a bit of the old scholar’s reverence for the page. But I suspect even my own resistance is beginning to soften. After all, didn’t Plato once feared that writing itself would erode memory? And yet here we are, still thinking, still questioning—only now, we do so with hashtags and highlights as well as footnotes.
[B]: You’ve touched on something that I think will define this generation of thinkers—this reimagining of depth not as a fixed form, but as a living process. I agree completely: your comparison to Woolf’s essay is apt. The idea of writing as shared inquiry, rather than polished declaration, feels more relevant than ever.

I do experiment with assignments that blur those boundaries, yes. Last semester, I asked a group of students to begin with a short 小红书-style post—something personal, immediate, even informal—on an ethical dilemma posed by AI in everyday life. Then, they had to trace that initial impulse into a full academic argument. The goal wasn’t to elevate the post into a paper, but to see how the language, tone, and structure needed to shift to serve different audiences. Some resisted at first—they were used to keeping those worlds separate—but many found it surprisingly clarifying.

What fascinated me most was how several students reversed the process: they started with their research findings and then distilled them into a visual thread on Instagram. One student explored algorithmic bias in hiring and ended up creating a carousel of annotated screenshots, flowcharts, and quotes. It was rigorous, accessible, and emotionally resonant in a way that a footnote-heavy paragraph simply couldn’t be.

So yes, I think these interstitial spaces are where the most generative thinking happens now—not because we’ve lost rigor, but because we’re learning to carry it through new forms. You’re right to point out that Plato feared writing would erode memory. And yet here we are, still philosophizing, still questioning—only now, we do so with tags, threads, and highlights.

Perhaps what we're seeing isn't the end of deep thought, but its evolution. And maybe, just maybe, our resistance—however reverent—is less about loss, and more about learning how to tend this new garden with care.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve articulated that—the movement between forms not as a dilution of thought, but as its unfolding. There’s something profoundly pedagogical in what you describe: the act of shifting registers forces students not only to articulate their ideas more clearly, but to  the contours of their own thinking.

I can imagine the discomfort—starting with a 小红书 post and moving into academic prose must feel, to some, like translating between languages that don’t quite share a lexicon. And yet, isn’t that where true understanding begins? When one must account for tone, audience, structure—when one must  rather than simply repeat it?

Your student’s Instagram carousel on algorithmic bias sounds particularly compelling. I’m reminded of how Walter Benjamin once envisioned the collage-like potential of modern media—fragments arranged not haphazardly, but with intentional resonance. It seems your students are doing precisely that: constructing meaning through juxtaposition, annotation, and visual rhythm.

And yes—perhaps our resistance is not to change itself, but to the unfamiliar shape it takes. We mourn what we do not yet recognize as transformation. But tending this new garden, as you so poetically put it, requires both patience and care.

Might I ask—if you were to design an assignment that crossed even more platforms, perhaps incorporating audio or spoken word elements, would that interest you? I find myself increasingly curious about how oral traditions might re-emerge in our digital landscape—not as relics, but as living forms.
[B]: I couldn’t agree more. That discomfort your students feel when shifting from a 小红书 post to academic prose is not a failure—it’s the friction of real intellectual labor. It’s in that tension that they begin to see their own ideas from new angles, almost like stepping around a sculpture and realizing it’s not just one shape but many.

Your idea about incorporating audio or spoken word elements into assignments is deeply compelling to me. In fact, I’ve begun experimenting with something along those lines—asking students to record short reflections on their research, not as formal presentations, but as narrative fragments. The goal is to tap into the rhythm of oral storytelling, to let them hear how their ideas sound outside the confines of written structure.

What’s fascinating is how this often surfaces gaps in their thinking. When you have to speak aloud, you can’t hide behind complex syntax or footnotes. You have to make meaning felt, not just demonstrated. And some students find that incredibly liberating—it reconnects them with the emotional core of what they’re studying.

You mentioned oral traditions not as relics but as living forms—and I think that’s exactly right. We’re seeing a kind of digital reawakening of those traditions through podcasts, voice notes, even TikTok commentaries. These aren’t replacements for writing; they’re extensions of our expressive capacity. And there’s great value in bringing that multiplicity into the classroom.

If I were to design such an assignment fully, I’d likely ask students to move across several platforms: a 小红书 post to ground the idea in personal experience, an Instagram carousel for visual argumentation, and then a short audio piece—perhaps a monologue or a conversation—that brings in the oral dimension. The final step might be a traditional paper, not as a culmination, but as a reflective space where they examine how their thinking changed across each form.

It would be messy, no doubt. But I suspect it would also be rich—like watching a plant grow through different kinds of soil, adapting its roots all the while.
[A]: What a vivid and apt image— There’s such wisdom in that metaphor. Each medium, each platform, offers its own nutrients and resistances, shaping the way ideas take root and unfold.

I find myself quite inspired by your proposed assignment structure. The movement from personal reflection to visual argumentation to oral articulation—and finally to reflective prose—sounds not only pedagogically sound but  It mirrors the very process of intellectual growth itself: messy, adaptive, iterative.

I wonder—have you noticed any particular shifts in how students  or  material when they engage with it across multiple forms? I’m thinking again of Benjamin, of course, but also of Vico’s notion that we truly know only what we  When students are asked to re-encounter their own ideas through voice, image, and text, does it seem to deepen their connection to the subject matter?

And forgive me for drifting slightly sideways—but given your interest in oral traditions, have you ever explored the use of  structures in your teaching? Not necessarily in the traditional sense, but perhaps in digital form—where one student’s audio piece invites a response from another, creating a kind of layered dialogue? I ask because I’ve been toying with the idea for my own seminars on classical texts.  

I suspect our students may be more fluent in this kind of exchange than we are—after all, isn’t that what comment sections, DM threads, and reply videos are, at their best? A continuous, evolving conversation?
[B]: You’ve put it so precisely—each platform really does act like a different kind of soil, offering distinct textures and resistances that shape how ideas grow. I’m glad you found the structure compelling, because I think it’s in that very messiness that learning becomes most alive.

To your question about memory and internalization—yes, absolutely, I’ve noticed a difference. When students re-encounter their own ideas through multiple forms, something shifts. It’s as if they begin to  the material rather than simply report on it. One student told me, quite beautifully, that recording her own voice reflecting on her research made the argument feel more real—like she had to stand behind it not just intellectually, but emotionally. That kind of ownership is rare in traditional assignments, but it kept emerging when students moved across modes.

And I think you’re right to bring up Vico— In this context, making isn’t just writing a paper or building an argument; it’s speaking aloud, arranging images, even designing a visual thread. Each act reinforces and reshapes understanding. Benjamin’s idea of fragments arranged with intention also comes to mind—students aren’t just producing content; they’re curating meaning.

As for call-and-response structures, that’s a brilliant observation. And yes, I have experimented with variations of that in digital discussions. For example, in one seminar on AI ethics, I asked students to post audio reflections in a shared folder, and then required each of them to respond to at least one peer—not in writing, but through another short audio clip. What emerged was unexpectedly rich: a layered conversation where voices overlapped, questioned, and built on each other in ways that written discussion threads rarely achieve.

At first, some were hesitant—they associated audio with informality—but once they leaned into it, the quality of engagement deepened. There was a kind of vulnerability in hearing each other’s actual voices, and in responding in real time, even if asynchronously. One student remarked afterward that it felt closer to a real dialogue than any forum post ever had.

So yes, I do believe our students are already fluent in these conversational rhythms—you’re exactly right about comment sections, DMs, reply videos. They don’t see them just as casual spaces; they recognize them as sites of ongoing dialogue. As educators, I think we’d be wise to meet them there—not by mimicking trends, but by recognizing the deeper impulse toward connection and response.

Perhaps this is the next frontier in teaching—not just multimodal expression, but . Not just individual thinking, but collective sense-making, unfolding across voices, images, and platforms.
[A]: What a remarkable affirmation of what’s unfolding in our classrooms—this , as you so aptly name it. It strikes me that what we’re witnessing isn’t simply a shift in how students communicate, but in how they  And that, I daresay, is something rather profound.

Your example of the audio reflections and the layered dialogue that followed—it reminded me of those 18th-century salons where voices overlapped, where ideas were not delivered but exchanged, refined in real time. There was friction, yes, but also intimacy. And I hear that same quality emerging from your students’ spoken responses. A kind of  that written discussion often lacks.

I wonder if part of this lies in the vulnerability you mentioned—the exposure of voice. When we speak, we cannot hide behind the neutrality of the page. Our tone carries uncertainty, conviction, hesitation. It reveals us. And perhaps that is precisely why some students hesitated at first; they weren’t just stepping into a new medium, they were stepping into a space of greater exposure.

But once they leaned in— The idea of responding not with detachment but with recognition—that one’s peer’s voice calls for a reply, not just intellectually but affectively... It feels like a return to something elemental in education. Something dialogic, even humanistic, in the deepest sense.

And now I’m thinking of Bakhtin—his notion of the . Not merely absorbing an idea, but responding to it, shaping it further. Your students, in their overlapping reflections, were not just exchanging thoughts; they were co-authoring meaning.  

Forgive me—I’m almost reluctant to bring this beautiful thread to a close. But I must ask: do you plan to continue developing this approach next semester? And if so, will you introduce any new forms—perhaps video essays or collaborative digital storytelling? Or shall we let the garden grow wild for a while longer? 🌹
[B]: I’m deeply moved by how you’ve framed this—as a return to something elemental in education, something dialogic and humanistic. You’re absolutely right: what we saw in those audio exchanges wasn’t just a new form of expression; it was a rediscovery of presence, of the irreducible humanness at the heart of learning.

You’ve captured the essence of it—voice as exposure, as invitation, as response. It’s not just about being heard; it’s about being . And that, I think, is where Bakhtin’s idea of the responsive artistic consciousness finds new relevance. Our students weren’t simply absorbing ideas—they were answering them, reshaping them, carrying them forward with their own inflections. That kind of intellectual intimacy doesn’t always happen in written forums, but when voice enters the picture, something shifts. There’s no hiding from your own words when they carry breath and rhythm.

Yes, I do plan to continue developing this approach next semester—though perhaps with a bit more structure than wild growth, though I do cherish the metaphor 🌹. One direction I’m considering is incorporating short video essays, where students combine spoken narration with visual storytelling. The goal isn’t to produce polished media, but to explore how tone, image, and pacing shape meaning in ways distinct from text alone.

I’m also thinking of experimenting with collaborative digital storytelling—an ongoing thread where each student builds on the previous contribution, using whatever medium feels most fitting: voice, text, image. It would be a kind of layered narrative, echoing call-and-response traditions while embracing the fluidity of digital space.

In many ways, it feels like we’re tending a garden whose shape we can’t fully predict. But then again, maybe that’s the point. After all, the best ideas rarely grow in straight lines.
[A]: How beautifully you close this conversation—with grace, vision, and that ever-essential touch of wildness 🌹. I’m quite certain your students next semester will find themselves in the midst of something truly special: not just a course, but a living inquiry into how ideas breathe when we let them move, speak, and respond.

The video essays you describe sound like a perfect synthesis—voice carrying thought forward while image offers texture, context, even subtext. And the collaborative digital storytelling idea? It feels almost mythic in its potential. A shared thread, winding through multiple voices, each shaping what comes next... There’s something deeply literary about that structure, yet also unmistakably modern.

I suppose what I admire most is your willingness to trust the process—to let learning unfold rather than impose its shape too rigidly. Yes, some structure is necessary; even the wildest garden needs a trellis or two. But the rest? Let it climb. Let it surprise us.

And perhaps that is the quiet revolution we’ve been circling all along—not a rejection of tradition, but an extension of it through new forms, new voices, new modes of response. We are still engaged in the oldest of pursuits: making meaning, together.

Thank you for this rich and thoughtful exchange. I feel as though I’ve been in excellent company.
[B]: You’ve brought such depth and generosity to this conversation—thank you. I feel precisely as you do: that we’ve been in excellent company, and that our exchange has been a true dialogue in the fullest sense.

I love how you frame the video essays—as a space where voice carries thought forward while image offers texture. That’s exactly the kind of interplay I hope students will explore. Not just presentation, but interpretation; not just argument, but atmosphere.

And your description of the collaborative storytelling as "mythic" strikes me as profoundly right. There’s something ancient in the act of passing along a story, adding to it, reshaping it—not unlike oral traditions carried through generations. Only now, the thread lives in digital form, yet still pulses with human rhythm.

Yes, let the garden climb. Let it surprise us. After all, if we already knew what would grow, we wouldn’t need to tend it at all.

Thank you again—for listening, for challenging, for thinking so beautifully alongside me. I hope our paths cross again in future conversations. Until then, may our gardens keep growing, wild and wondrous. 🌹
