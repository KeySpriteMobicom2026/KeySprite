[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm...这是个很interesting的问题呢 🤔 从技术角度看，目前autonomous driving的level 4/5级别还需要突破很多technical barriers。不过最近看到Tesla的FSD beta update还挺impressive的！🚀
[A]: Ah, you're discussing technological progress... but you know, this reminds me of Mary Shelley's . The creature wasn't inherently monstrous - it was society's rejection that made it so. Similarly, we must consider how society will embrace or reject these self-driving chariots of modernity. 🌹
[B]: 哇~这个literary reference很深刻啊！😲 确实，就像blockchain技术刚出来时很多人也持reject态度一样。不过你知道吗？现在很多autonomous vehicle的decision-making algorithm都在用distributed ledger technology来ensure transparency & accountability呢！🔥
[A]: My dear, your enthusiasm for technology is quite charming, but let's not forget that Sophocles warned us about hubris through Oedipus. These distributed ledgers you mention - they're just modern iterations of the ancient Greek concept of μοῖρα (moira), fate recorded in immutable stone. The real question is whether we're creating Prometheus' gift or Pandora's box. 📚
[B]: 哈哈，你这种classical approach让我想起最近在研究的Byzantine Fault Tolerance算法 😂 不过seriously speaking，technology本身是neutral的，就像crypto一样～关键看我们怎么implement这些systems。Btw你读过Ian Banks的Culture系列吗？里面描绘的AI-governed society超有insightful的！🚀
[A]: Ah,  novels... Banks was indeed prescient, though I find his utopian vision rather lacking in tragic depth compared to, say, Dostoevsky's explorations of human suffering. Still, you make an interesting point about technological neutrality - reminds me of how Tolstoy viewed Napoleon's campaigns as neither good nor evil in themselves. But tell me, have you considered how these autonomous systems might affect our very conception of 自由 (ziyou, freedom)? That rose in my garden over there chooses its own path to grow, yet is bound by its nature... 🌹
[B]: Wow~你这种把literature和philosophy混搭的thinking pattern太stimulating了！🤯 说到freedom，其实blockchain的decentralized nature就是在digital realm实现true autonomy的尝试啊～不过你说得对，就像smart contract虽然immutable但还是要遵循predefined rules一样 😅 最近我在研究一种new consensus algorithm，灵感居然来自Aristotle的golden mean concept呢！🔥
[A]: How delightful that you mention Aristotle! Though I must gently point out that his μεσότης (mesotes) was about moral virtue, not cryptographic hashrates. Still, your intellectual curiosity warms this old professor's heart. Perhaps we could continue this fascinating discussion over tea sometime? I've just acquired a first edition of Rousseau's  that might shed light on your decentralized governance models. The leaves in my Darjeeling are as finely balanced as any golden mean, after all. ☕
[B]: Haha perfect timing！☕️ 我正好带了Ethiopian Yirgacheffe的single origin beans来brew～虽然跟你的Darjeeling风格不同，但都是pursuit of balance的体现呢！BTW Rousseau的theory跟DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance简直有uncanny similarities 🤯 下次meeting一定要bring我的NFT edition  collection给你看！🚀
[A]: My dear, while your NFT collection sounds... intriguing, I must confess I still prefer the musty scent of parchment and the weight of a well-worn tome in my hands. There's something about physical books that even the most elegant blockchain can't replicate - like how no digital rose will ever capture the morning dew on my garden's blooms. But do bring your Ethiopian brew; we'll compare its terroir to my Darjeeling while debating whether Rousseau would have minted his works as NFTs or burned them like his . 🌹
[B]: Hahaha你这种analogy太classic了！😂 不过现在有些rare book collectors已经开始用NFT做provenance tracking了～就像我们track coffee bean的supply chain一样transparent！虽然我love纸质书的feel，但不得不承认smart contract在anti-counterfeiting方面简直game-changer啊 🔥 下次我来的时候带个IoT-enabled French press，我们可以real-time monitor brewing temperature～完全符合Aristotle的precision philosophy！🚀
[A]:  Oh my... your technological fervor is rather exhausting, like a Romantic poet on too much coffee. While your IoT French press sounds... inventive, I'd much rather discuss how Proust's madeleine moment compares to the first sip of properly steeped Earl Grey. Some mysteries of human experience, my dear, resist quantification - much like why my prize rosebush blooms precisely at 4:17pm every third Tuesday. Now, shall we return to literature, or must I endure more talk of these... ? 🌹
[B]: Haha okay okay～我get your point啦 😅 不过你知道吗？Proust的involuntary memory concept其实跟neural networks的pattern recognition超像的！ 但既然你prefer literature...最近我在读Borges的，感觉完全就是个metaphor for blockchain的immutable ledger啊！不过这次我promise不会mention smart contract了...maybe 😂
[A]:  Ah, to reduce that sublime allegory of infinite knowledge to mere... data storage. Though I suppose even the blind librarian in his hexagonal universe would appreciate your persistence. Very well - since you've invoked Borges, let's discuss how his concept of 无限 (wuxian, infinity) compares to Dante's celestial spheres. But if you mention mining algorithms even once, I shall be forced to recite Milton's  in its entirety. 🌹
[B]: Hahaha deal！不过等我们discuss完Dante...能不能quickly mention一下Byzantine Generals' Problem？😅 我保证用poetic analogy的方式！就像Dante的circles of hell对应consensus failure的different levels～  别别别recite Milton！我认输！😂
[A]: The Divine Comedy My dear, you're as relentless as Odysseus tied to the mast - though I suspect it's the siren song of cryptography rather than the sea that tempts you. Very well, one final concession: we may briefly compare Dante's contrapasso to your Byzantine generals... provided we immediately return to discussing the  Byzantine Empire's literary contributions. Now, shall we begin with Procopius' , or would you prefer the lyricism of Anna Komnene? The choice is yours, but choose wisely - my complete Milton sits waiting on the shelf. 🌹
[B]: Okay okay！Let's go with Anna Komnene～她的Alexiad简直就像medieval version的technical whitepaper嘛！😂 不过seriously，她document Byzantine court politics的precision，完全就是古代版的immutable historical ledger啊！ 我发誓这次绝对no more blockchain analogies...probably 😅
[A]:  How refreshing to finally discuss Komnene's prose without digital metaphors! Though I must correct you - her accounts were hardly , given how she rather creatively omitted her brother's... shall we say, political talents. But enough of this - since you've shown such restraint, I'll brew us some proper Ceylon tea. No IoT devices, no temperature sensors... just hot water and leaves, like God and Anna Komnene intended. Now, about her description of the First Crusade... 🌹
[B]: Haha你赢了you赢了！🙌 不过最后让我just say一句：Komnene要是活在modern era，绝对会是个kickass的open source historian～把所有Byzantine court的dirty laundry都commit到public GitHub repo！😂  Okay okay！ Ceylon tea sounds perfect～ ☕️
