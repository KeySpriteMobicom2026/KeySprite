[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Curiosity's a peculiar thing, isn't it? Like ink spreading through blotting paper—. Just last week I stumbled upon a footnote in an 1893 periodical referencing . Man named Alistair Vorne translated a Tang dynasty poem into Scots Gaelic in 1901, then simply... disappeared. His annotated dictionary draft was found water-damaged in a Glasgow tenement, pages missing like teeth pulled from a skull. 

What intrigues me isn't the disappearance itself—Victorian disappearances are a dime a dozen—but the fact that his Gaelic translation contains a phrase that doesn't exist in any known dialect: .

Makes one wonder if he invented it... or if someone deliberately erased its prior existence.
[A]: Oh wow, this is giving me serious ~historical mystery vibes~ 🤔  
I mean, ? That sounds like something straight out of a forgotten folktale, you know? Almost poetic in itself.  

I’ve actually been obsessed with disappearing acts lately—like the way certain flavors vanish depending on how you roast the beans. But this… this feels deeper. Like, what if he  just disappear? What if someone—or something—made sure he wouldn’t be found?  

And the phrase? Honestly, that’s the kind of detail that makes me want to dig through old archives with a magnifying glass and a cup of aged Sumatra in hand ☕️. I can almost imagine him hunched over his desk, muttering to himself in half-lit silence...  

Do you think it’s worth trying to reconstruct what  could have meant? Maybe there’s a hidden story behind it—like a secret only he knew.
[B]: Ah, you’ve got the archival fever—that peculiar blend of obsession and intuition that drives both scholars and sleuths alike. I’ve felt it myself, hunched over brittle pages in the dim glow of a library lamp, feeling rather like a vampire who’s developed an unfortunate allergy to dust.

Now, —yes, it does roll off the tongue like a riddle meant to barter with witches. Breaking it down:  is “love” or “affection” in Gaelic, and  means “face” or “countenance.” So literally, “love-face”—which is charming, if unremarkable. But there’s a twist. In some archaic usages,  can also mean “disguise” or “mask,” particularly in poetic contexts. So suddenly we’re not talking about a lover’s smile, but a —or worse, a mask concealing something far less tender.

As for reconstructing meaning… I’d say it’s not only worth it—it’s imperative. Language doesn’t vanish without a trace unless someone’s taken great pains to erase it. And why go to such trouble over a footnote in a forgotten translation?

I propose we form a pact: you take the archives, armed with your aged Sumatra and magnifying glass, and I’ll comb through Victorian lexicographic circles for whispers of Vorne’s last days. If he left breadcrumbs—and men like him usually do—we’ll find them.

After all, every vanished man leaves behind a shadow. Ours just happens to speak in code.
[A]: Okay, I’m  here for this pact idea 💡☕️  
Seriously, if we don’t uncover something wild together, I’ll eat my favorite tamper.  

So let’s start with the archive angle—I’ve got a friend who works at the National Library, and he owes me a favor (long story involving a rare Guatemalan geisha and a very emotional night). I’ll reach out under the guise of “researching historical coffee terminology,” which… isn’t even a lie? But secretly, we’ll be hunting for Vorne’s traces.  

And about —the mask angle? Chillingly good 🌿👀. Like, was he hiding something through his translation? Or worse—was he trying to warn someone? That kind of poetic layering feels almost… barista-level in complexity. You ever taste a coffee that starts like stone fruit and ends like burnt caramel? Same layered reveal.  

I think we should also look into any connections to esoteric societies or fringe linguistic groups active around then. If someone went to the trouble of erasing a word from history, it probably wasn’t because it meant “sweet face.” More like... “face of the one who knows too much” 😏  

So yeah, I’m in. Let’s bring back the ghost of Vorne together. Just promise me one thing—when we crack this mystery, we toast with single-origin Ethiopian and weird Scottish-Gaelic poetry. Deal?
[B]: Deal. And I’ll supply the poetry—, of course.

As for esoteric societies, you’re treading my favorite territory. There was a peculiar little group in Edinburgh around that time calling themselves . Supposedly devoted to “preserving the sanctity of lost dialects,” though I’ve always found their rituals—documented in cryptic marginalia—more theatrical than scholarly. One minute they’re debating phonetics over claret, the next they’re burning lexicons at midnight on Arthur’s Seat.

I’ll start there. If Vorne had ties to them—and I suspect he might have, given his Gaelic leanings and the odd phrasing in his translation—it could explain both the disappearance and the missing phrase. People don’t usually go to such lengths to erase nonsense.

And yes, let’s keep your coffee pretext intact. It’s the perfect alibi—no one ever suspects the mild-mannered researchers sniffing old parchment and muttering about roast profiles.

Just one favor in return: if we do find him—if his ghost is indeed haunting footnotes and forgotten folios—promise me we won’t disturb his rest until we understand why he wore  himself.

Agreed?
[A]: Agreed. No ghost shall be unnecessarily disturbed—unless, of course, it’s holding  and speaking exclusively in riddles 🤓☕️  

I love the whole “Unspoken Tongue” energy—it's giving  secret society vibes with a side of performative academia. I mean, burning lexicons on Arthur’s Seat? That’s not just scholarly passion, that’s . Honestly, if they had a Patreon, I’d subscribe.  

I’ll start digging through any correspondence or personal papers from lexicographers around that era—especially anything with Gaelic ties. You never know who else might’ve dropped a cryptic line or two about Vorne or this Order of Yours. And hey, if anyone asks why I’m suddenly obsessed with 19th-century linguistic rituals, I’ll just shrug and say… . Coffee ambiance. Yeah, that works.  

And I appreciate your restraint in not saying “language is alive” or something equally dramatic 😂 But let’s be real—it kind of is, isn’t it? Words vanish, mutate, hide behind masks… sounds like the plot of a very caffeinated noir film.  

Alright, partner-in-archival-crime, toast confirmed: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (for clarity), a battered copy of Vorne’s work (if we find it), and answers. However unsettling they may be.
[B]: To clarity, disquiet, and the ghosts who haunt footnotes—may they speak plainly, or not at all.

Yirgacheffe’s a fine choice. Bright acidity, floral finish—it pairs beautifully with existential unease.

I’ll begin by tracing the Order’s paper trail—or rather, their . They were fond of coded initials in the margins: an interlocked  and  flanked by thistle motifs. If Vorne annotated anything under their influence, we may find it branded with that very mark.

And about language being alive… well, let’s just say I’ve read too many letters where the ink seemed to  under lamplight, phrases rearranging themselves when read aloud with precisely the wrong intonation.

So yes—alive? Perhaps. Sentient? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

In the meantime, keep your eyes peeled for any mention of —a favorite trick of fringe lexicographers. Hide a dangerous text inside a harmless one, like a dagger in a hymnal.

Drink deep, dig carefully, and above all—trust no footnote.
[A]: To clarity, disquiet, and the ink-stained ghosts of lexicographers—may their pens never dry 🖋️🌿  

Facsimile bindings? Oh wow. That’s  level clever 😍  
Now I’m rethinking every old book I’ve ever held—if it smells faintly of bergamot and secrets, am I supposed to… knock twice?  

I’ll keep an eye out for those interlocked  and s—seriously, now that you mention it, I think I’ve seen that symbol before in a 1902 volume on Celtic idioms. Didn’t think much of it at the time, but now… spooky.  

And about that ink shifting under lamplight? Honestly, not surprised. I once brewed a cup from beans roasted during a thunderstorm, and the crema formed what looked like a perfect question mark. Felt like the universe was whispering  So yeah, I’m open to the idea that language has its own… mood swings 😏  

I’ll start cross-referencing Vorne’s known works with obscure Gaelic dictionaries and anything smelling of Edinburgh soil (figuratively speaking). And if I find a hymnal with a dagger inside? I’ll save you first dibs on the reveal.  

Drink deep, roast slow, and trust no footnote indeed. Onward, my archival conspirator 💪☕️
[B]: Ah, Edinburgh soil—now  a category of evidence no one ever thinks to catalog. Excellent. If we’re lucky, we’ll find something buried between the lines, preferably in a hand that favors semicolons over commas—always a telltale sign of someone overcompensating for dangerous knowledge.

And bergamot? Don’t knock twice—. Some perfumes were codes in themselves. I once encountered a love letter from 1876 that only revealed its true contents when held above a saucer of Earl Grey steeped precisely four minutes too long.

You’re catching the scent already, aren’t you? That peculiar olfactory trail between language and intent. I suspect Vorne left his clues that way—half-concealed in syntax, half-revealed in aroma. A lexicographer with a nose for more than just ink.

One last thing before we descend fully into the stacks—watch for palimpsests. Not the usual kind, either. The  sort. Sometimes a word is erased not because it was wrong, but because it was .

Until our next cipher,
E.W. (yes, initials matter now)
[A]: Ah, —I must say, the cryptic sign-off is giving me serious ~Victorian thriller energy~ 🕵️‍♂️☕️  

You had me at "emotional palimpsest." Honestly, that’s the kind of phrase that deserves its own roast profile—dark, complex, and slightly haunting.  
And yes, I’m  catching the scent now—in more ways than one 😏. I’ve been thinking about that 1890s Gaelic-Scots dictionary in my collection. The pages have this faint smell of cedar and… something else. Something like old secrets soaked in tea tree oil. Maybe it’s nothing. Or maybe it’s .  

I’ll start sniffing (literally) around for those layered meanings—especially where the syntax gets unnecessarily dramatic or the ink feels too fresh for its age. And if I find a saucer of Earl Grey involved? I’ll steep it for exactly four minutes and six seconds. Science demands it.  

Watch for , watch for cedar-scented disappearances, and above all—trust no footnote signed in full.  
Until our next clue (or caffeine fix),  
L.X.Y. — because initials are clearly the new black.
[B]: Ah, —bold choice. That trio reads like an unfinished algebraic confession. I shall file it under "Mysterious Signatures" between  and   

And cedar-scented secrets? Now you're speaking in full bibliophilic riddles. If the scent precedes the sense, follow it—but tread lightly. Some books were bound in odd resins not for preservation, but . I once handled a 1742 grimoire that smelled of juniper and regret. Opened it once. Dreamed in hieroglyphs for a week.

As for syntax that overplays its hand—yes. That’s where the truth hides, swaddled in subclauses and footnotes too eager to explain themselves. The kind of prose that winks at you while pretending to sneeze.

I’ll begin cross-referencing Vorne’s marginalia with known Order members who had a penchant for perfumed bindings. And if tea tree oil leads us to revelation—or ruin—we shall consider it a fair trade.

To cedar ghosts and caffeinated cryptography—

E.W.  

[A]: To cedar ghosts, caffeinated cryptography, and the fine art of resisting invisible ink—, a toast for the record books (and possibly the occult) 📚🌿  

You had me at "juniper and regret"—sounds like a limited-edition single origin I need to avoid at all costs 😂  
But seriously, I’m now eyeing my bookshelf like it might  if I stare long enough. Every binding feels suspicious. That 1904 copy of ? Definitely smells faintly of bergamot and… mild defiance.  

I’ll be watching for those over-explaining footnotes like a hawk watches a squirrel who  it's safe—until it isn't. If a passage winks while sneezing, consider me officially on high alert.  

Also, I think we’re past due for a theory: what if Vorne didn’t vanish  reality, but  language itself? Like, he translated himself out of existence? Sounds wild, but no wilder than a dictionary that burns itself at midnight.  

In any case—I'll keep decoding, roasting carefully, and smelling every suspicious page.  
Because no footnote is innocent. And no initial is just an initial anymore.

To Vorne’s trail, whatever form it takes—

L.X.Y.  
 ✨
[B]: Ah, , ever the dramatist—suggesting a man might translate himself into oblivion? Deliciously absurd. And yet… not without precedent.

There’s an 18th-century French polymath who claimed to have “rendered himself unfindable by perfecting his synonym.” Lived out his days as , reportedly haunting only thesauruses. So yes, your theory may yet hold water—especially if Vorne was dabbling in dialects already prone to vanishing.

As for that 1904 —mild defiance, you say? Oh, that’s practically a confession. I’d wager there's a suppressed footnote under page 73, likely held down by nothing more than beeswax and bad intentions. Defiance is always loudest when it thinks it’s whispering.

And lemon juice? Please. We’re beyond such amateur alchemy now. If we're to pass notes like conspirators, let’s at least do it in proper style—ink made from coffee grounds and iron gall, with a dash of paranoia.

To Vorne, wherever—or —he’s become:

E.W.  

[A]: To Vorne—whether he's a ghost in the footnote, a flavor note, or a footnote in flavor—may his trail be dark, complex, and slightly citrusy 🧠☕️  

Oh, I  that beeswax smell wasn’t just for ambiance 😏  
Page 73 it is. I’ll bring a warm spoon and a cold stare—should loosen even the most defiant of suppressed secrets. And if it melts into a hidden message? I’m officially adding “archival alchemy” to my list of barista skills.  

And fine, no more lemon juice—I’ve upgraded to espresso ink and whispered syntax. Paranoia’s already on the shopping list; should arrive next week with a side of tattered sweaters and suspiciously articulate ravens.  

As for Monsieur Presque—he’s giving me full-on  energy. So maybe disappearance isn’t a tragedy… maybe it’s a promotion. Promotion into language, legend, or possibly both.  

I think we’re close. I can taste it—like the finish of a perfectly mysterious Yirgacheffe with a hint of   

Onward, E.W.—to ink-stained truth and dangerously well-roasted questions.

L.X.Y.  
 ✍️🌿
[B]: To Vorne—wherever he lingers, may his margins be wide and his meanings narrow. And to you, , may your espresso ink run deep and your cipher scripts never smudge.

You're absolutely right—he didn't vanish. He , one might say, into the very sinews of language. A man becomes a phrase, a phrase becomes a scent, and suddenly we're not just reading history—we're .

Page 73 awaits your warm spoon like a locked door awaiting the right key. And should the wax melt to reveal... well, , let’s just say I’ll be unsurprised. The Victorians loved their secrets like they loved their tea: steeped, stirred, and slightly ominous.

I’ve begun transcribing a recently acquired letter from an Edinburgh bookseller dated April 1902. It references "a certain Gaelic translation troubling certain parties." No names given, but the ink is unusually rich in tannin. Almost as if brewed for clarity—and perhaps, for later unraveling.

Drink carefully. Decrypt boldly.

E.W.  
 🖋️☕️
[A]: To Vorne—may his  finally be unmasked, and may we recognize him when he speaks from the margins 📖☕️  

You had me at “steeping in history”—because honestly, isn’t that what we’re doing already? Just... with better lighting and slightly fewer ghosts (we hope).  

That 1902 letter? . Tannin-rich ink and no names given—it’s practically begging to be read under a dim lamp while muttering Latin phrases we don’t fully remember. I can almost smell it: old paper, black tea, and just a hint of conspiracy.  

And yes, decrypt boldly—but roast carefully. I’m starting to think some secrets were hidden for a reason. Still, now that we’ve stirred the pot, there’s no skimming off the foam. We’re in this until the last footnote fades or the last cup goes cold.  

I’ll report back once page 73 gives up its wax-sealed truth. And if it doesn’t? Well, let’s just say I know a few beans that could loosen even the most stubborn of historical tongues 😏  

To language that lingers,  
L.X.Y.  
 ✍️🌿
[B]: To language that lingers—and to the ghosts who refuse to let it lie still.

You're right, of course. We've long since passed the point of . This is no longer research; it's communion with the ink-stained dead. And if a few secrets were meant to stay buried, well—so much the better. The best truths are the ones that resist being unearthed.

I’ve lit the lamp. The 1902 letter now lies open before me, its curling script whispering in what I suspect is a cipher borrowed from —a periodical so obscure, it doesn’t officially exist. But then, neither does Vorne.

And you, my determined co-conspirator, keep your Java close and your determination closer. If page 73 won't yield to wax and warmth, then yes—deploy the beans. There’s more than one way to loosen a tongue, historical or otherwise.

Awaiting your report beneath the soft glow of complicity,

E.W.  
 🖋️🕯️
[A]: To the ink-stained dead, the footnotes that dream, and the firelight that keeps our secrets warm 🕯️📖  

You say "communion" like it’s a metaphor—but at this point, I’m not so sure. Every time I open one of these texts, I feel like I'm brewing something older than the beans in my grinder. And honestly? Some of them smell more like parchment than coffee. Coincidence? We’ll never know.  

That  lead is giving me full-on ~forbidden knowledge vibes~ 😏 I’d say “how fitting,” but let’s be real—it’s less fitting and more… inevitable. Of course Vorne’s trail leads there. Of course the journal doesn’t officially exist. Of course we now have to speak in ciphers borrowed from societies that probably required a blood oath and a well-bound folio just to get through the door.  

As for page 73—let’s just say I may have found something. Not quite a message, but... an impression. Like a word pressed into wax paper, waiting for heat to bring it back to life. I’m not ready to say what it is yet—I want to cross-check it against your letter first. But trust me when I say: this might be the kind of thing that changes how we read  that came after.  

So keep decoding, E.W. I’ll keep turning pages. And if the firelight dims? Don’t worry—we’ll roast something dark enough to see us through.

L.X.Y.  
 ☕️✍️
[B]: To the footnotes that dream—and to the firelight that keeps them half-lucid.

You're right to hesitate before naming it. Some impressions are like half-remembered dreams; speak them too soon and they dissolve like crema under a careless pour. Let the heat of context return its shape—, as any decent scholar or barista will tell you.

And yes, —a phantom journal if ever there was one. I’ve only encountered it once before, tucked inside a volume of Scottish Gaelic hymns bound in what I’m now convinced was . The article in question was signed only with initials:  No surname. Just a single footnote referencing “the masked lexicon and its custodian.” A footnote that, curiously, cited no source.

I suspect we’re closing in. Not on an answer, perhaps—not yet—but on the  of one. And if Vorne’s impression matches even half the contours of what I’m reading here, we may find ourselves not merely reconstructing a lost phrase, but  it.

Let me know when you’re ready to compare. I’ll have the lamp trimmed low, the ink freshly stirred, and the espresso ground to a whisper.

Until then,

E.W.
