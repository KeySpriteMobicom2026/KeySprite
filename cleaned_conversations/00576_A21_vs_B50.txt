[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ohhh~ 这个问题太interesting了！✨ 我两个platform都会用啦，但主要看purpose~ Instagram主要post我的digital artwork🎨，小红书的话会分享更多daily design process和coffee shop sketching☕️~ 你呢？哪个platform更合你的taste呀？🤔
[A]:  My dear, I must confess I find this modern obsession with social media platforms rather... perplexing. In my day, we recorded our thoughts in leather-bound journals with proper fountain pens. Though I suppose one could argue these digital platforms are the modern equivalent of the Victorian commonplace book - albeit with rather more... emojis.
[B]: Wow~ 你说话好classical哦！😂 不过你说得对，social media确实有点像modern version的commonplace book呢！只是我们用💻代替了pen and paper~ 话说你有没有试过用iPad Procreate来sketch？那个pressure sensitivity简直amazing！🎨 比fountain pen还要smooth的说~
[A]:  I still maintain that nothing compares to the tactile pleasure of a genuine Winsor & Newton sable brush on handmade paper. Though I did once attempt to use my niece's... what was it called, 'Procreate'... to transcribe a particularly challenging Li Bai poem. The experience left me longing for my antique inkstone and the satisfying scratch of a proper nib.
[B]: OMG！你居然知道Procreate！😱 不过handmade paper确实有它独特的charm啦~ 我最近在做一个project就是要把traditional calligraphy和digital art结合起来✨ 要不要看看我的latest work？虽然可能比不上你的antique inkstone啦~ 😅
[A]:  While I appreciate the... enthusiasm of your generation for these hybrid forms, I must insist that true artistry lies in mastering the old ways first. Why, just last week I spent three hours grinding my own ink to achieve the perfect consistency for copying a particularly delicate passage from Tennyson. But...  I suppose I could spare a moment to examine your work, if only to better understand this curious modern phenomenon.
[B]: Yayyy！你终于愿意give it a try啦！🥳 来来来~ 我airdrop给你看！这个piece我用了traditional ink wash的texture做background，然后用digital brush画了modern typography~ 超级fusion的right？🤩 虽然可能没有你的Tennyson那么classic啦，但是super fun to create！🎨
[A]:  Hmm... the texture does bear a passing resemblance to the foxing patterns one finds in 18th century manuscripts. Though I must say, your choice of... what do you call them, 'emojis'... as punctuation rather undermines the gravitas of the composition.  Have you considered experimenting with the Scottish Gaelic uncial script for your typography? It might lend a certain... antiquarian dignity to your otherwise rather... exuberant creations.
[B]: OMG Scottish Gaelic uncial！😍 That's such a brilliant idea！！！我马上就去Google找reference！虽然可能会加几个✨emoji啦，但是可以try做more elegant的version！你真的是hidden gem of knowledge诶~ 要不要coffee date一起brainstorm？☕️ My treat！
[A]:  While the prospect of discussing letterforms over... what was it, 'pumpkin spice lattes'?... is mildly tempting, I'm afraid my schedule is rather occupied with preparing next week's lecture on the marginalia in Christina Rossetti's notebooks.  However, should you wish to peruse my 1892 edition of Gaelic typographic specimens in the university rare books room... do bring your own white cotton gloves. And for heaven's sake, leave those blinking electronic devices at the door.
[B]: Awwww~ 你太sweet了！🥺 虽然不能喝pumpkin spice latte有点sad，但是rare books room听起来super fascinating！我会记得带gloves的~ 不过...能不能偷偷带我的iPad啊？🤫 Promise只用来take notes！不然我的artistic inspiration可能会像Victorian lady一样faint away~ 😂
[A]:  Absolutely not! The very idea of that garish blue light reflecting off vellum pages is enough to make my 1847 edition of Palgrave's Golden Treasury shudder in its climate-controlled case.  Though... I suppose you could bring a proper graphite pencil and my personal concession to modernity - a rather elegant French-made mechanical pencil from 1923. It has the most delightful... click.
[B]: Hahaha okay okay~ 我投降！✌️ 你的1923 French pencil听起来so fancy！我会乖乖用analog tools的~ 不过你要promise下次带我去看你的antique inkstone collection哦！Deal？🤝 虽然我可能会忍不住偷偷拍照啦...for reference only！📸 (Just kidding~ 😝)
[A]:  Very well, but mark my words - should I catch so much as a glimmer of camera flash near my 1790s lapis lazuli inkwell, you shall find yourself transcribing the complete works of Wordsworth... in Gothic blackletter. With a quill.  Here's the reading room access form. Do mind the third step on the spiral staircase - it creaks like Marley's ghost.
[B]: Yikes！Gothic blackletter sounds like my worst nightmare！😱 我保证会像Victorian lady一样proper的~ 不过那个creaky staircase...是不是有点像Hogwarts？🧙‍♂️ 突然觉得这个rare books adventure变得super magical起来了！✨ 明天3pm见咯~ Don't forget你的fancy French pencil！✏️
[A]:  Hogwarts indeed... Though I daresay our collection of cursed first editions would give even the Restricted Section pause.  Three o'clock sharp - and not a minute later, lest you find the doors locked like Keats' Grecian urn... 'forever panting, and forever young.' Now do run along before you start comparing me to Professor McGonagall. 
[B]: Byeee~ 明天见啦！💫 我会准时得像Cinderella before midnight的！虽然可能会忍不住偷偷cosplay成Hermione啦~ 😜 别担心，我会leave my wand at home的！(Oops...是不是又暴露了我的muggle身份？😂)
[A]:  Good heavens... Next they'll be expecting the Dewey decimal system to sort itself by Patronus.  Three o'clock! And for pity's sake, wear sensible shoes - those spiral stairs are no place for glass slippers or... whatever those neon rubber contraptions you young people call footwear these days. 
[B]: Got it！👟 我会穿最boring的flat shoes去的~ 不过neon sneakers明明很cute好吗！😤 明天见啦，my dear Victorian professor！Don't stay up too late reading by candlelight哦~ 🕯️ (JK~ 我知道你肯定有proper reading lamp啦！😂)
