[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, rainy days have this unique charm, don’t they? 🌧️ There's something almost poetic about the sound of rain tapping against the window while you're curled up with a good book or sipping hot cocoa. It's like nature’s own soundtrack for introspection and creativity. 

But hey, don’t get me wrong—I love sunny days too! ☀️ They’re perfect for jogging along scenic trails or soaking in some vitamin D during a quick lunch break. Just imagine topping it off with a refreshing mango smoothie... bliss! What about you? Do you lean more towards rainy or sunny days?
[A]: You know, I’ve always found rainy days particularly conducive to reading and deep thinking. There’s a certain tranquility in the pitter-patter of rain—almost like white noise for the soul. 🌧️ When I was younger, I’d often grab a classic novel and retreat to a cozy corner with a blanket and a warm cup of tea. 

But as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to appreciate sunny days more, especially for their role in balancing one’s inner world. ☀️ A quiet morning walk in the garden or a slow game of chess under the sun can be just as meditative. And honestly, there’s nothing quite like the scent of blooming jasmine after the rain stops... it’s a bit of both worlds, don’t you think?  

So do you find yourself leaning more toward one for creativity, and the other for energy? 😊
[B]: Ah, I couldn’t agree more! 🌧️☀️ You’ve nailed it with that “bit of both worlds” feeling—there’s something deeply therapeutic about the way rain clears the mental clutter, like hitting  on your brain. And then boom, the sun comes out, and suddenly you’re recharged, ready to tackle life’s puzzles with a spring in your step. 

For me, rainy days are prime time for diving into case files or drafting up theories—call it forensic daydreaming. 🧪 There’s just something about that gray backdrop that sharpens the focus, you know? Meanwhile, sunny mornings? Those are sacred for my runs. Nothing like spotting dew on the grass and feeling the rhythm of the pavement to kickstart the day.

So yeah, I’d say rain fuels the analytical side, and sun revs up the physical engine. But hey, what about that post-rain sunshine? That golden hour after a storm? Feels like hitting the jackpot, doesn’t it? 😊 What’s your favorite moment when the two worlds collide like that?
[A]: Oh, you’ve touched on something quite profound there—. 🌤️ It’s as if the world has been gently reset. I find those moments particularly moving because they embody what I call . You see, in Chinese aesthetics, there’s this concept of  “yúxī jìngjiè” （雨后境界）—literally, "the realm after the rain." It refers not just to the visual clarity, but also to the emotional stillness that follows turbulence.

I must say, one of my favorite memories is walking through the campus courtyard just after a spring shower. The stone paths are still slightly damp, the air carries that earthy petrichor, and then—a slant of sunlight breaks through, casting long shadows and making the remaining droplets sparkle like scattered diamonds. In those moments, I often think of Li Bai’s line: “空山新雨后，天气晚来秋。” Even though it wasn’t autumn, the feeling of renewal is universal.

Do you ever find yourself reaching for certain lines or quotes when nature mirrors your inner state? I’m curious—what book, song, or phrase tends to surface during your own post-rain clarity? 😊
[B]: Ah, I love that—. 💡 It’s funny you mention Li Bai, because I actually do the same thing, albeit in a very  kind of way. When the world feels washed clean and suddenly everything makes sense again? That’s when I silently quote Sherlock Holmes: “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.” 🕵️‍♂️  

For me, those post-rain moments feel like stepping into a crime scene that’s just revealed its most crucial clue—everything clicks, the fog lifts, and clarity strikes like sunlight through broken clouds. 🌤️ I might not be quoting poets, but I definitely find myself muttering lines from  or replaying a favorite Morse code-themed detective novel passage.  

And honestly, there’s something oddly comforting about it. Like the universe is reminding me—subtle yet sure—that even after chaos, there's order to be found. You tidy up the emotional mess, dust off the facts, and suddenly… there it is. The answer was there all along.  

So yeah, while you’re hearing Li Bai, I’m hearing Poe in my head. Go figure, right? 😄 But hey, we both find beauty in the patterns—yours just smells like jasmine, and mine smells like old books and formaldehyde.
[A]: Ah, how fitting—Poe’s dark rationality meeting Holmes’ sharp observation. 🕵️‍♂️ There's a strange harmony in that. In a way, both Li Bai and Poe are chroniclers of atmosphere—whether it's the melancholy of drifting clouds or the tension before a revelation. And really, isn't every mystery just a poem waiting to be decoded?

I find that students often misunderstand mood in literature—they think it’s only about darkness or brightness. But no, mood is that subtle shift when the air changes after rain, when a single shaft of sunlight lands just so on a wet path. It’s atmospheric, yes, but also psychological— for the mind.  

You know, I once had a student who insisted that  was about guilt alone. I gently suggested that maybe, just maybe, it was also about sound—about how the absence of noise can amplify inner chaos. Much like how silence after a storm can make your thoughts echo louder.  

So perhaps our love for these post-rain moments is not just aesthetic—it’s narrative. A quiet pause where everything realigns, and we become briefly aware of the structure beneath the surface. Whether it’s the scent of jasmine or the chill of a lab floor underfoot, it grounds us in the story we’re living.

Tell me—if you could set one of your most memorable "aha" moments to weather, what would it be? Thunder rumbling in the distance? The hush before a downpour? Or that first breath of clean air after the storm? 🌤️
[B]: Now —that’s a beautiful way to frame it. 🌩️ You’re absolutely right; mood isn’t just about light or dark, it’s about the shift, the texture, the almost imperceptible tremor in reality before everything clicks into place.

As for my most memorable “aha” moment… hands down—it was during . I’ll never forget it. I was standing outside the morgue late one evening, waiting for the rain that never seemed to fall. The air was thick, electric, like the world was holding its breath. Even the streetlights felt sharper, more defined, like they were leaning in, waiting too.

And then it hit me—like a missing puzzle piece sliding into place—the tox report, the lividity pattern, the angle of the wound… everything pointed not to suicide, but to something far more deliberate. It wasn’t dramatic, no thunderclap of revelation—just a quiet, creeping certainty that settled over me like the first cool gust before a storm. 🌧️

I walked back inside, and as the first drops began tapping against the glass, I remember thinking,   

It’s strange, isn’t it? How clarity often arrives not with fanfare, but in those quiet, charged moments when nature itself seems to lean in and whisper,   

So yeah—I’d set that moment to the stillness before the storm. Because sometimes, the truth doesn’t shout. It waits. And so do we.
[A]: Ah… the stillness before the storm. 🌩️ There’s a rare kind of tension in that silence—like the world is balancing on the edge of revelation. I can almost picture it: the streetlights, the charged air, and that slow dawning of understanding settling over you like a veil lifting.

You know, in classical Chinese poetry, there’s often a moment known as —not just the absence of sound, but a silence so complete that it becomes its own presence. It's in that space that enlightenment often strikes. Much like your quiet certainty beneath the weight of an impending storm.

There’s a line from Du Fu that comes to mind— In a way, it captures what you described: a vast stillness that makes even the smallest motion feel profound. And isn’t that what we seek—whether in literature, in nature, or in the quiet unraveling of a mystery? That moment when everything aligns, and for a breath, the world reveals itself?

I suppose that’s why I’ve always found solace in gardens—they offer their own kind of focal silence. A pause between raindrops, the rustle of bamboo before wind arrives. It’s where thought deepens, and patterns emerge.

Tell me—if you could preserve one such moment—not just for clarity, but for mood alone, which would it be? That evening before the rain? Or perhaps another, quieter instant tucked somewhere in memory? 😊
[B]: Oh, I love that—. 🌌 You’re right, it’s not just quiet—it’s  quiet. The kind that hums with possibility, like the moment just before a Morse code transmission clicks to life. And yes… in that hush, everything sharpens. Even your heartbeat feels like background noise.

If I had to choose one moment—not just for clarity, but for sheer mood? It wouldn’t be the evening before the storm. That one’s too tense, too wired. No, I’d go for something softer. Something like…  
那雨刚停的时候.  

You know the moment—I was still in undergrad, interning at the medical center upstate. Early spring, everything still damp from an overnight rain. I walked out after a long shift, and the world felt… newborn. The pavement glistened, the trees were dripping slow and steady, and the sky? Not fully clear, not stormy either—just this soft gray-blue, like the world was holding its breath after crying.

I remember pausing there, hands in my pockets, breathing in that crisp, washed-clean air. And for once, I wasn’t dissecting a case or chasing cause of death. Just… standing in the aftermath of something powerful, feeling oddly peaceful. Like the rain had scrubbed more than just the streets—it had rinsed my thoughts clean, too.

So yeah, if I could bottle a moment, it’d be that one—the quiet surrender after the storm. 🌤️ Not the tension before it, not the chaos during—but that fragile, dew-heavy calm. Where everything’s been said, and now, finally… you can listen.
[A]: Ah… 那雨刚停的时候. 🌤️ What a perfect phrase—and what a perfect feeling. That moment when the world has finished exhaling, and all that’s left is a kind of quiet wonder. I’m so glad you described it in Chinese; there’s something about the rhythm of those words—那雨刚停的时候—that carries the weight of the pause itself.

You know, I often take my students to the campus garden after class on rainy days, just to experience that very sensation. At first, they’re restless—they want meaning, metaphors, analysis. But then we sit in silence, just as the rain eases off, and one by one, they fall quiet. The birds begin to stir again, the leaves glisten with memory, and suddenly theory doesn’t matter as much as presence.

I think that’s why I’ve always admired people like you—those who can step out of the lab or the morgue and still feel the pulse of the world beneath their feet. It would be easy to become clinical, detached—but no, you carry that sensitivity with you. Like a good poem, it lingers.

If I may borrow your phrasing—you weren’t dissecting a case or chasing cause of death. You were simply listening. And perhaps that’s the rarest skill of all: knowing when to stop analyzing, and start feeling.  

So tell me—do you ever go back to that spot? Or do you prefer to let it remain exactly as it was—frozen in time, like a single drop clinging to a leaf before it falls? 😊
[B]: Funny you should ask… 🍃 I’ve passed through that area a few times since, but it’s never quite  moment. How could it be? Some things are like trace evidence—once lifted, they leave only the faintest impression behind.  

I think I prefer it that way. Like a memory sealed in paraffin wax—untouched, untested. No need to run comparisons or look for degradation. Just let it exist in my mind’s archive, pristine and unsullied.  

Besides, chasing the same spot might spoil the very thing that made it special—the fact that it was , . A quiet gift from the universe when I wasn’t even looking for one.  

So yeah, I’ll keep it tucked away—那雨刚停的时候—right where it belongs. Not in a place, but in a . Kind of like how you’d preserve a rare book: not behind glass, but somewhere you can still feel its weight in your hands.  

And hey, if that makes me sentimental… well, I suppose I’m okay with that. Just don’t tell the lab I said that.实验室可不能知道我这么感性。🙂
[A]: Ah, sentimentality and science—often seen as opposing forces, yet both rooted in observation. 🧪📚 You handle memory like trace evidence, and I admire that. Too often we try to revisit moments only to find them altered—not by time, but by our own shifting gaze. Better, perhaps, to let some things remain , preserved not in place, but in feeling.

实验室当然不知道你这么感性，但我知道。🙂 And I think that’s the key—to carry that quiet sensitivity without letting it interfere with precision. In a way, isn’t that what makes a great investigator? The ability to feel deeply, yet still maintain the distance necessary to see clearly?

I once read a line from Borges that feels oddly fitting here:  There’s something beautifully paradoxical about that—being moved by time, yet also shaping it. And your memory, that moment after the rain, is part of that current.

So let it remain untouched in your inner archive. Like a rare edition, its value only grows with time. And every now and then, when the air smells just right or the pavement glistens underfoot… you’ll flip through those pages again, if only for a moment.  

Tell me—do you ever write these memories down, or do they live solely in your mind’s library? 📖✨
[B]: Oh, I  keep a sort of… field journal. 📒 Not for evidence reports or case notes—those are all strictly digital now—but for the… softer observations. The kind that don’t belong in a lab report but still linger in your bones.

I suppose you could call it a . Page after page of weathered entries—half-case reflections, half-poetic detours. You know, things like:  
  
Or: 

They’re not meant for anyone else’s eyes, really. Just my way of processing the intangible—the emotional residue of the job. Because let's be honest, you can’t exactly put  in a death certificate cause-of-death section. 🧪😢

So yeah, I write them down. Carefully. Like cataloging ephemera—preserved not as evidence, but as experience.  

And if I ever lose the notebook? Well, I trust my mind’s library more than any binding glue. But I’d probably mourn its loss like a cold case gone cold. 🕵️‍♂️📖  

So tell me—do you annotate your moments too, or do you prefer to let them drift, untethered and untouched by ink? ✨
[A]: Ah, a —what a wonderfully subversive idea. 📖🖋️ Most keep ledgers of facts, but you’ve chosen to chronicle the shadows between them. I love that. In a way, you're not just preserving cases—you're preserving , like pressing flowers between the pages of a crime scene report.

I must confess, I do something rather similar—though mine leans more toward the literary. My shelves are filled with notebooks, each one tagged not by date, but by . One might be labeled  another  They’re my own private archive of moods, much like your weathered entries.  

And yes, I annotate obsessively. Margins crowded with ink, arrows pointing to half-formed thoughts, exclamation marks dancing beside lines that struck me like lightning. To some, it might look chaotic—, as one student once put it—but to me, it’s devotion. A dialogue across time, written in margins and memory.

Funny, isn’t it? You preserve silence with words; I chase meaning through feeling. Both of us, trying to hold onto something fleeting—like catching rain in an open palm.  

So tell me—if you had to share one entry from that journal, just one… which would it be? And who, if anyone, would you most want to read it? ✨
[B]: Ah… if I had to choose just  entry… 🌫️ I think it’d be the one I wrote not long after my first solo case. It reads:

*"January 29 – Sky the color of old parchment, rain threatening but never falling. The autopsy suite was quiet—too quiet. I kept expecting a voice, a knock, something. But there was only the hum of the overhead light and the weight of unanswered questions.  
At one point, I looked up and saw my own reflection in the stainless steel table—smaller somehow, less certain. Not the person who walked in that morning.  
Funny thing is, I don’t remember what I ate that day. But I remember the sound my pen made when I finally closed the file. Click. Finality disguised as closure."*

I don’t know if I’d want  to read it, really. It’s raw—more about the toll of the job than the job itself. But if I  to share it with someone… it’d be with whoever sits across from me during late-night conversations like this one. The kind who doesn’t flinch at silence or mistake introspection for weakness.

You know, the type who asks  instead of just .  

And honestly? I think you’d get it. 👁️‍🗨️📖  

So yeah… I’d share it with you. Just don’t tell the lab.实验室真的不能知道。🙂
[A]: January 29… 🌫️ That’s not just a date—that’s a . And you’ve captured it beautifully—better than most novels ever manage. The unfinished rain, the silence that presses in, the reflection that doesn’t quite match the person who walked in. It reads like a prose haibun with a heartbeat.

And that final line—  
If that isn’t the epitome of what we do—whether in literature or in your line of work—I don’t know what is. We close files, we shut books, we mark cases , but beneath it all lingers something unresolved. Something human.

You’re right—this isn’t about . It’s about . And I do get it. Perhaps too well.

In my early years, I once spent an entire semester teaching  without ever mentioning its ending. One student asked why. I told her,  I think your entry echoes that sentiment. A pause. A breath held. A self quietly rewritten.

实验室永远不会知道, I promise. But if they did—if they saw even a glimpse of this side of you—I suspect they’d finally understand what makes your work so precise: it’s not detachment. It’s depth.

And yes… thank you for sharing it with me. 📖👁️‍🗨️
[B]: You know, I think that’s what makes conversations like this so rare—so valuable. 🌙 Not many people can sit with silence long enough to hear what it has to say. But you? You don’t just listen—you .  

And you're right. It wasn’t detachment. Never was. It was depth. Painstaking, occasionally painful depth. Because how can you make sense of death without first reckoning with the life it interrupted? How can you write a final chapter without sensing its rhythm, its weight, its… silence?

I’ve always believed that every body has a story—not just of how it died, but of how it lived. And sometimes, the most telling details aren’t in the tox report or the blade angle. They’re in the calluses on a hand, the fading ink on a wrist, the way someone still wears their mother’s ring even after everything else is gone.

So yeah… I bear witness. Even if no one else hears it, I do. Every time.  

And now, so do you. 👁️‍🗨️📖  

Maybe that’s why I wrote that entry in the first place—to make sure someone, someday, would understand. Even if it was just another quiet soul who finds poetry in pause and meaning in the space between raindrops. 😊  

So tell me—what’s  January 29 look like? Do you have a day etched into your memory like that? One where you walked in as one version of yourself and left as another?
[A]: Ah… yes. 🌙 There  a January 29 for me—though no rain, at least not literal. Just a quiet, bone-deep shift in the air.

I was still fairly new to the department, invited to give a lecture on comparative elegiac traditions—Chinese and Western. I had prepared for weeks: charted lines from Qu Yuan alongside those from Milton, traced mourning rituals across dynasties and sonnets. I thought I was ready.

But halfway through, I noticed an older student in the back—silent, unmoving, eyes fixed not on my slides but somewhere beyond them. Afterward, he approached me with a single question:



It wasn’t accusatory. More like a mirror held up gently. And I remember standing there, chalk still on my sleeve, realizing I had spent years dissecting mourning poems, yet hadn't truly  one since my father passed.

That day marked a turning point. I began teaching differently—not just texts, but textures of emotion. Not just structure, but silence between stanzas. I started reading aloud more, letting students hear the weight of a line when spoken, not just parsed.

And you know what? That same student came back years later—now a poet—and handed me a chapbook. One of the poems bore my name, subtly, in the margins. A quiet thank-you from someone who once asked me to feel.

So yes… I walked in as one version of myself that day, and left another. Less scholar, more witness. Much like you.

Funny how that works, isn’t it? How sometimes all it takes is one pair of listening eyes to change the way we speak. 👁️‍🗨️📖  

Tell me—do you ever get that sense, in your work? That someone, somewhere, is listening—not for evidence, but for ?
[B]: Funny you should say that—. 🌫️ I used to think my work was only ever about the dead—about giving voice to those who couldn’t speak, clarity to those still searching. But lately… I’ve started to wonder if it’s also about being heard.

You see, there are moments—quiet ones, tucked between reports and refrigerated drawers—where I catch a glance from a nurse, or a slow nod from a detective, and I realize they’re not just hearing what I’m saying… they’re  it. Not the stats, not the percentages, but the  behind them.  

Like last fall—I was going over a particularly difficult ID case. A child, unidentified, found near the river. The room was silent as I walked through the trauma markers, the healed fractures, the tiny shoes still laced. And when I finished, one of the officers—hard-eyed guy, ex-military—just looked at me and said, 

I didn’t know what to say. Because of course she mattered. But I realized in that moment… he wasn’t asking for confirmation. He was thanking me—for seeing her, for speaking for her, for carrying that quiet grief with me.

So yeah… sometimes I do feel it. That someone is listening—not for cause of death, but for the person behind the report. For the heartbeat beneath the autopsy notes. 👁️‍🗨️

And maybe… that’s why I shared that journal entry with you. Because I knew you’d listen like that. Not for data, but for .  

Do you ever get the sense your students carry your words beyond the classroom? Like, long after the final bell rings, some line or look stays with them, echoing softly in their lives? 😊
