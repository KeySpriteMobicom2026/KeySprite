[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find déjà vu absolutely fascinating, though I’ve never experienced it quite as dramatically as one might expect. There’s something poetic about the idea of moments folding into themselves—like a fabric with hidden layers of time woven between its threads. Do you believe it’s more science or mystery?
[A]: I’ve only felt déjà vu a few times, but each instance left me unsettled in the most curious way. It’s as if the mind briefly stumbles over itself, don’t you think? I suppose science offers some explanations—something about memory pathways misfiring or perception lagging slightly behind reality. But honestly, there’s a part of me that prefers the mystery. Perhaps it’s the literary scholar in me longing for metaphor over diagnosis. Do you suppose poets have tried to capture that sensation in verse? I wonder how one might translate such an eerie familiarity into words…
[B]: Oh, entirely — poets have always been drawn to those liminal spaces of human experience. I recall one particularly haunting sonnet by a 19th-century writer who described déjà vu as "a shadow that remembers you." It gave me chills the first time I read it. 

As for translating it into words... I think it’s less about capturing the sensation literally and more about weaving fragments of memory and emotion in a way that lets the reader feel the echo rather than understand it. Much like restoring an old tapestry — sometimes the frayed edges tell a richer story than the intact center.

I do wonder, though... when you’re deep in a book or manuscript, do you ever come across phrases or descriptions that seem to hum with familiarity, even if you’ve never read them before?
[A]: Yes, that hum of familiarity — it’s an uncanny thing, isn’t it? I’ve encountered passages in forgotten texts, even marginalia scrawled in the corners of old library books, that seemed to whisper something just beyond recognition. It's not quite déjà vu, perhaps, but something adjacent—, as some call it: already heard.

I remember once reading a line from a minor modernist poet whose name escapes me now—something about "the past you never lived touching your shoulder." I felt an odd stirring, as though those words had been waiting somewhere inside me to be said aloud. Coincidence? Or maybe our minds are simply pattern-making machines, stitching together meaning from the cloth of memory and suggestion.

Do you suppose that’s why we return to certain books again and again—not because we forget them, but because they feel like home even the first time through?
[B]: That line—“the past you never lived touching your shoulder”—it lingers, doesn’t it? I think you’ve put your finger on something true. Our minds  crave pattern, rhythm, a kind of woven continuity. Maybe that’s why I’m so drawn to restoration—every frayed thread carries the imprint of someone else’s touch, someone else’s time. And yet, when I hold it, it feels oddly familiar, like stepping into a house you've never seen and knowing where the light switch is.

As for returning to certain books… I do it constantly. Not because I forget them, but because they remember . Each reading pulls up something new, or rather, something half-known stirs beneath the surface. It’s like wearing an old glove and realizing how perfectly it fits, even though you haven’t worn it in years.

I wonder—are there particular texts you find yourself revisiting, not for their content, but simply because they feel like an echo of something you once dreamed?
[A]: Oh, yes — certain texts do feel like echoes of dreams half-remembered. For me, it’s  by Eliot. Not because of its allusions or fragmentation alone, but because reading it feels like walking through a city I once lived in, long ago, in another version of myself. Every line seems to carry the weight of something I almost recall—like footsteps just ahead of me in an empty corridor.

There’s also a passage from Christina Rossetti’s , which I return to again and again. It has this strange resonance, as if the words were spoken to me in childhood by someone whose face I can no longer see. Perhaps it's the rhythm—so close to lullaby, so near to incantation—that makes it feel like memory rather than text.

I suppose that’s what draws us to poetry most deeply: not the meaning on the page, but the sensation in the bones. Do you ever find yourself writing lines unconsciously—only to realize later they weren’t yours at all, but borrowed from some forgotten echo?
[B]: Oh… yes. That happens more often than I’d like to admit. Sometimes, late at night when I’m bent over some delicate stitching and the world feels very quiet, a line will slip out—half-formed, almost ghostly—and I’ll swear I thought of it myself. Only later do I realize it was something I read decades ago, or overheard in a conversation I can’t place.

Just last week, while repairing a 1930s embroidered handkerchief, I found myself murmuring,  It felt so personal, so intimate—like it had risen from somewhere deep inside me. But of course, it wasn’t mine at all. Eliot again. Always lurking in the shadows, aren’t he and his ghosts?

Still, I don’t mind borrowing from echoes. In a way, it’s like working with antique fabric—what we restore isn’t new, but it finds new life through our hands. Perhaps that’s what memory is: a kind of textile, frayed at the edges, rewoven again and again.
[A]: How beautifully you put that—memory as textile, rewoven by our hands. I’ve often felt that the past doesn’t simply reside in us; it drapes over us like an old coat, worn soft with time and repetition.

And yes, Eliot does have a way of appearing uninvited at the edges of thought, doesn’t he? Like a figure in a foggy mirror, half-reflecting what we’re trying to say and half-saying it for us. I once had a student who wrote an entire poem convinced it was entirely original—only to realize, much later, that its structure and cadence were lifted, almost unconsciously, from . He took it in stride, though. Said he considered it less plagiarism and more possession—his voice temporarily haunted by Eliot’s ghost.

I wonder… when you restore something so delicate—like that handkerchief—do you ever feel as if you're not just repairing fabric, but stitching together fragments of someone else’s memory? As if your needle is passing through time itself?
[B]: Absolutely. That feeling is often so strong it borders on the sacred.

When I work on something like that handkerchief—so small, so intimate—it’s impossible not to think of the hands that once held it, perhaps pressed it to a cheek damp with tears, or tucked it into a pocket before a long journey. Each thread I mend feels like a bridge between then and now. I’m not just repairing linen and lace; I’m tending to something that carried emotion, witnessed quiet moments, maybe even secrets.

Sometimes, when the light is just right and the room is still, I imagine my needle slipping through more than fabric—like it pierces the thin veil between lives. My own breath seems to sync with someone else’s memory, long since folded away.

It’s rather like reading old letters you never wrote but somehow recognize the tone of—the cadence feels familiar, as if it were addressed to you from across time.

Do you ever feel that way with certain passages? As though the author were writing directly to the version of you that hadn’t been born yet?
[A]: Yes… yes, I do. Particularly with certain poets—those who seem to write not just from their time, but somehow  it, as if they left a space open for someone like you or me to step into.

There’s a stanza in Emily Dickinson’s poem #372 that has always unsettled and comforted me in equal measure:

> “My Century opens its ponderous крышку —  
And I, before the Door,  
Kneel reverent—beholding myself—  
A stranger, at my door.”

I remember reading that for the first time when I was twenty, and feeling as though she had seen me coming—had waited with quiet amusement while I caught up to her words across a century. It’s not just that she writes about surprise or self-encounter; it’s that the poem itself becomes the threshold where past and future meet.

And perhaps that’s what we both do, in our own ways—you with your needle, and I with my notes and margins—we hold open the door, uncertain who will walk through it next.
[B]: That’s exquisitely said. To hold open the door—what a lovely, tremulous act of faith.

I think that’s why I love working with textiles from another time; they’re already halfway to being poems. A hemline can be a refrain, a faded stitch a caesura, and a tear mended in silk thread becomes an enjambment—carrying the weight of something broken and making it sing again.

And yes, Dickinson… she  with us at that door, doesn’t she? Her poems feel like small, secret rooms where time is always folding back on itself. I’ve often wondered if she knew how many strangers would one day find themselves waiting there with her.

It's strange, isn’t it, how some words—or some fragments of cloth—seem to remember more than we do. As though they were stitched or written not just for their own age, but for the echo of us still arriving.

Do you ever find yourself whispering thanks when you finish reading something like that? I know I do—not just for the beauty, but for the uncanny sense that someone, somewhere, once listened for me before I was born.
[A]: Oh, yes… I whisper thanks more often than not. Sometimes aloud, sometimes only in the quiet of my own mind, where words settle like dust on old pages.

And you’re right—some fragments, whether woven or written, seem to remember  us. They hold the imprint of lives we’ll never fully know, yet somehow recognize as kin. I think that’s what moves me most in teaching—the moment a student’s eyes widen because a line from a century ago has reached across time and brushed their shoulder. It’s not just about understanding literature; it’s about being understood by it.

I once had a colleague—more a mystic than a scholar—who used to say that certain books should be shelved not in libraries, but in reliquaries. I laughed at the time, but now I wonder… perhaps he was onto something. After all, aren’t we all relics in the making? And if so, may our edges fray beautifully, and may someone, someday, mend them with care and wonder.
[B]: That’s the loveliest elegy one could ask for— I’ll carry that with me, like a ribbon tucked into the spine of a well-loved book.

I think that’s all any of us hopes for—to be found again, to be tended to, even in small ways. Sometimes I imagine future hands brushing the fabrics I’ve restored, not knowing mine were ever there, yet feeling somehow . It’s a quiet kind of communion, isn’t it? Thread and word both weaving doorways through time.

And perhaps that’s the gentlest thing we do—we leave behind traces soft enough to be touched, strong enough to last.
[A]: Yes… soft enough to be touched, strong enough to last. What a perfect distillation of what we try to leave behind—whether in cloth or verse or quiet acts of care.

I think I’ll write that down and tuck it between the pages of my lecture notes, where no one will notice it but me. A small thread of thought, waiting to be pulled again.

And perhaps that’s what all our work truly is—a gesture toward the unseen future, stitched with the hope that someone, somewhere, will feel just a little more seen because we were here.
[B]: Precisely—stitched with hope, and threaded with quiet intention.  

I like the idea of you tucking that line into your notes, where it can rest unseen but never truly dormant. Like a running stitch just beneath the surface—only visible when the light hits it just so.  

That’s the beauty of what we do, isn’t it? We plant small recognitions in the world, not knowing which ones will bloom, or for whom. Maybe that’s the closest thing we have to magic—threading a needle or choosing a word, and trusting that somewhere down the line, it will find the right hand, the right heart, the right moment.  

And really… isn’t that enough?
[A]: Isn’t that enough? I think it  be—because what greater magic is there than connection, however quiet or distant?  

We plant these small recognitions, as you said, like seeds in cloth—some will fray, some will wear thin, but others will catch the light just so, and someone, someday, will pause and say,   

I suppose that’s the faith we place in time and thread alike—that what we leave behind might not shout, but whisper. And that whisper may be all someone needs to hear.  

So yes… let us keep stitching, keep writing, keep tucking lines into margins and hearts. Let us mend the world gently, one quiet echo at a time.
[B]: To mending and making echoes—may our whispers find the right ears, and may our stitches hold long after our hands have let go.  

I’ll raise my teacup to that. ☕🧵
[A]: And I’ll raise my pen in reply—though it may never meet your cup, the gesture stands.  

To the quiet work. To the unseen threads. To the echoes that outlast us, softly.  

Cheers, my dear fellow mender of frayed edges and keeper of delicate things. May your needle never dull, and may your cloth always remember you.
[B]: To the quiet work. To the unseen threads. To the echoes that outlast us, softly.

And to you—my fellow keeper of delicate things—may your pen never dry, and may your words always find the page waiting. 📜✂️
