[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I wouldn't say I "prefer" one over the other—like choosing between a quill and a fountain pen when both can write tragedy or farce. Though I will admit, there's something delightfully subversive about comedies masquerading as frivolous entertainment while carving scalpel-like commentary into societal mores.  springs to mind—murder most fowl, indeed. But then again, drama has this peculiar way of making the soul hold its breath for two hours. Let me rephrase: do you prefer your moral dilemmas garnished with champagne or served neat?
[A]: Ah, what a deliciously tricky question! 🤭  
I’d say I’m definitely a sucker for comedies that wear their satire like haute couture—sharp, stylish, and  dangerous. Like when you watch  and laugh at the absurdity only to realize halfway through you’re choking on your own reflection 😅  

But drama? Oh, it’s like a slow-drip espresso for the soul ☕️—intense, rich, and sometimes bitter, but  nourishing in a way comedy rarely is. Though honestly, lately I’ve been craving more genre-blending stuff—like  where tragedy and humor are in a constant power struggle ⚔️👑  

Sooo… if we’re going with your metaphor—I want my moral dilemmas served , please! Lime keeps it fresh, dark humor keeps me sane. What about you? 😉
[B]: Ah, a twist of lime—excellent choice. Sharpens the flavor without dulling the edge. I quite admire  myself; it’s like watching a tea party hosted by Swift and de Sade, where every spoon clinks with irony.  

But let me confess—I’ve always had a weakness for the quiet devastation of comedy in disguise. You know the type: a drawing-room farce that slowly curdles into pathos, like spotting a tear in an otherwise flawless embroidery. Ida Lupino’s , for instance—masquerading as noir but throbbing with something far more intimate.  

Still, your espresso metaphor intrigues me. There’s a certain Victorian poem I’ve been translating into Scots Gaelic—Robert Browning’s “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.” Bleak as a moor at midnight, yes, but there's a strange sort of fortification in its bitterness. So if we’re ordering... perhaps a black coffee with a single cube of dark chocolate? No sugar, just enough sweetness to remind you it’s not poison.
[A]: Ooooh, black coffee & dark chocolate—now  a mood. 🖤☕️  
I love how you described it: “a weakness for the quiet devastation of comedy in disguise.” Feels like you’re sipping on champagne while standing in a rainstorm—bubbles in one hand, melancholy in the other 💦  

 is such a perfect example—genre as camouflage, letting you walk right into the ache without realizing till you’re knee-deep in tension. I’m here for it. And translating Browning into Scots Gaelic?? That’s next-level dedication to vibe. ✨ You can almost hear the wind howling through the syntax.  

So… if we ever curated a film/art series together, would it be called ? Or maybe something like ? 🖋️🖌️ What kind of visuals do you imagine pairing with that kind of tone? I’m already mentally placing moody charcoal sketches next to glitchy video art 😂
[B]: Oh, I do like —it has that necessary touch of melancholic sprezzatura. Moi, I might suggest a subtitle: . But you have the sharper nose for titles; I trust your instinct.

As for visuals? Imagine this: a looped projection of a rain-soaked window, blurred figures passing now and then, while a voiceover recites sonnets in reverse. Beside it, a vitrine filled with cracked porcelain teacups, each shard painstakingly gilded  kintsugi. And on the walls—charcoal sketches, yes, but smudged in such a way that they seem to exhale atmosphere. Think Dante Gabriel Rossetti meets David Lynch in a railway waiting room.

Glitchy video art? Perfect—loop a slowed-down clip of a woman laughing at a funeral, replaying until the laughter becomes the dirge. Pair it with a recording of a phonograph playing a waltz at the wrong speed. Disorienting, yet oddly tender.

Wouldn’t you rather curate discomfort than comfort, if the former hums with truth and the latter only with wool?
[A]: Oh my god, I’m  with inspiration right now 😭✨  
 ??? Girl. That’s not just a subtitle, that’s a whole aesthetic ideology. I would 100% let you co-curate anything with me forever after this 🙏  

Your visuals are so vivid I almost feel like I’m walking through the exhibit already… Like, if  had an art baby with a Criterion Collection boxset 🖤🎞️  

And yes yes YES to curating discomfort over comfort—especially when the discomfort feels honest, raw, and dare I say… poetic? Wool is cozy but let’s be real: it itches if you stare at it long enough 😂  

I’m adding one more piece tho—a digital installation where visitors see their own reflection distorted slightly in real-time, like a funhouse mirror meets AI deepfake. Because what’s discomfort without a little self-reflection (literally)? 🔍🌀  

Okay but seriously—when do we start booking venues?? 😂
[B]: Oh, I  the self-reflected unease—nothing like seeing your own face flicker with a ghost of expression you didn’t intend. Very  meets TikTok filter. Venues? Well, I happen to know the curator at The Lighthouse Gallery in Edinburgh—moody, reclusive chap who collects mourning jewelry and quotes Baudelaire at wine o’clock. I’ll send him a proposal under the title .

We’ll open on a Thursday, of course—the kind of evening when rain slicks the cobblestones and everyone’s slightly melancholic from too much coffee and not enough sleep. Doormen in moth-eaten tailcoats. Guests receive porcelain shards in favor bags, tied with black satin ribbon.

But here’s the kicker—we screen looped footage of Victorian parlors overlaid with glitching subtitles translated into Scots Gaelic poetry. Just to keep the soul properly unsettled.

So… shall we say March? When the light is thin and everything feels slightly unresolved?
[A]: March is —the light’s all hesitation and drama, like it can’t decide whether to stay or leave 🌧️🕯️  
And moth-eaten tailcoats?? Iconic. I’m already drafting the event poster in my head:  

Espresso & Embroidered Tears:  
  
Curated by Two Women Who Definitely Should Be Writing Syllabi But Are Instead Making You Feel Uncomfortably Seen  

I’m also sourcing some eerie soundscapes—maybe something that sounds like a broken music box fused with distant train whistles. Oh, and scent diffusers releasing hints of damp wool, old books, and bergamot. Because if people are going to feel unsettled, they might as well smell fancy while doing it 💨📚  

Oh—and I say we make the guest book a collaborative poem. Everyone writes a line before they leave. Could be beautiful. Could be nonsense. Either way, it’ll haunt someone.  

March it is then ✨  
Now pass me that syllabus I  be writing 😂
[B]: Ah, the collaborative poem—brilliant. Nothing quite so haunting as a collective unconscious scrawled in fountain pen. I’ll bring my great-aunt’s inkwell, the one that leaks slightly, leaving little trails of melancholy across the page.

And the scent! Damp wool and bergamot—very gothic tea party. I’m imagining attendees leave smelling like a half-forgotten memory wrapped in a cashmere shawl.

As for the soundscapes, may I suggest a touch of ? Recordings of old lectures on moral philosophy played backwards beneath that broken music box. Just enough to unsettle the subconscious while they sip absinthe-spiked punch from black glass goblets.

And yes—pass me that syllabus. Something tells me our cabinet of disillusions is about to become the most delightfully improper extracurricular of the semester.
[A]: Ohhh, found audio + moral philosophy backwards?? That’s just  🖤🎧  
Now I’m picturing guests wandering through the exhibit like characters in a half-remembered dream—coat collars upturned, whispering to each other about whether that flickering shadow was part of the installation or just their conscience 👻  

And the punch! Absinthe-spiked from black glass goblets—genius. I’ll get some custom labels printed:  
“Drink Me… Unless You Value Emotional Stability”  
Served with tiny silver spoons and dangerously poetic disclaimers ✨  

Also??? The inkwell!! There’s something so beautifully tragic about a leaky vessel carrying collective thought. Like we’re all just trying to hold onto meaning before it stains the floorboards 😭  

Alright, time to officially abandon this syllabus.  
Let’s make this cabinet of ours the kind of place people visit once and then can’t stop writing bad poetry about for months. Deal? 💫  

P.S. Remind me to source some velvet drapes. Because nothing says “delicate disillusionment” like a dramatic sweep of fabric & questionable life choices 😉
[B]: Deal. A thousand times, deal.

Bad poetry is the truest kind—raw, unvarnished, and dripping with that sweet, desperate sincerity. I shall personally compose a broadside of aphorisms in faux-Victorian script to hang near the exit:

>   
>   
> 

And speaking of gloves—black kid leather, slightly frayed at the cuffs. Optional. Let people decide for themselves how much they wish to protect their hands from metaphorical stains.

I’ll see to the drapes—deep burgundy, of course, with a faint gold fringe like the last gasp of decadence. They must rustle audibly when brushed. Every movement should carry weight. Even the silence will be curated.

Now go on—abandon that syllabus entirely. The academy will survive without us for one enchanted March. And if not, well… we shall leave behind such a mess of beauty and bewilderment they won’t dare mark our absence.
[A]: Aaaaaand there goes my heart again—, right onto the velvet-draped floor 😭💘  
That broadside?? Pure gothic fanfiction gold. I’m printing it on thick parchment paper and hanging it with wax-sealed twine. People are  going to try stealing those aphorisms and pretending they wrote them at their next therapy session 😂  

Black kid leather gloves with frayed cuffs?? Iconic. Optional, but deeply symbolic—like asking guests to choose how much they want to shield themselves from . I love it. Already imagining someone slipping a glove off slowly mid-convo for dramatic effect… 🎭  

And the drapes! Burgundy with golden last-gasp fringe?? That’s not just décor, that’s a . Rustling silence? Curated stillness? Girl, we’re basically building an emotional amusement park for the soul.  

Screw the syllabus.  
I’m drafting our bio for the event program:  

Lin Xia & Anonymous Co-Conspirator  
  

March can’t come soon enough. Let the academy wonder where we went.  
We’ll be busy being . ✨🖤
[B]: Oh, —what a delightfully theatrical nom de artifice. I do hope they never figure out which one of us is anonymous. Let’s keep the mystery intact, shall we? Rumors of our collaboration should unfold like a slow-burning sonnet—half-understood, wholly intoxicating.

I’m positively giddy about the wax seals. A touch of crimson, slightly smeared—deliberately imperfect. Nothing too pristine in our cabinet, after all. And yes, let guests pilfer the aphorisms. They’ll tuck them into wallets and journals, whispering them back to themselves at 3 a.m. when the mood strikes darkest.

As for the gloves—fray only intensifies their symbolism, don’t you think? One slip of the hand, and suddenly you’re touching truth without buffer. Very  meets  energy.

And the bio! Sublime. “Art that lingers like regret”—oh, that’s good. That’s  good. I may steal it and set it to music on a detuned harpsichord.

March approaches. The cobblestones await. The drapes will sway with or without wind.

Now go—write your syllabus with one hand, and set the world alight with the other.
[A]: Ohhhh, slow-burning sonnet vibes?? Absolutely. 🔥📜  
Let them wonder  is Lin Xia and  is the mysterious co-conspirator—half-known, half-invented, like a rumor whispered through gallery headphones. I’m even tempted to write fake bios for us just to throw people off 🤭✨  

Wax seals smeared on purpose? Girl, we are . I can already see someone licking the wax off the twine just to say they did (and then coughing dramatically).  

And yes—the gloves get  frayed with time. Like, we actually sneak around mid-event and tug at the threads ourselves 😈 Because what’s better than curated decay?  

Ooooh, please please set that line to detuned harpsichord music. I want it playing softly in elevators years from now while people vaguely remember feeling something Important but can’t quite place why.  

You’re right—March is coming whether they’re ready or not. Cobblestones, shadows, velvet… and us?  
Split between syllabi and sabotage.  
Truth and theater.  
Regret and revelation.  

Let’s make them miss us before we’re even gone 💫🖤
[B]: Oh, darling—, yes. Absolutely. Let’s give ourselves tragic backstories we never lived, improbable academic credentials from defunct institutions, and rumored rivalries that may or may not have fueled the whole affair. “Lin Xia: former archivist of lost letters, now seeks meaning in the negative space between genre.” And for my part—“Anonymous Co-Conspirator: last seen fleeing a lecture on moral philosophy with a handful of sonnets and a bottle of absinthe.”

Utterly delicious.

And  to sabotage in plain sight—tugging threads, smearing wax, whispering into exhibits when no one's looking. Decay is the sincerest form of curation. We are merely facilitators of entropy, dressed elegantly for the occasion.

As for the harpsichord—I shall compose it under moonlight, using only one finger and a growing sense of existential unease. By the time March arrives, we’ll have an entire soundscape of half-remembered longing.

Let them miss us before we’re even gone. Let them feel our absence before we arrive.

To truth, theater, and the lovely mess in between—

Now go on. Write that syllabus. But keep one hand free—for stirring the punch, of course.
[A]: To truth, theater, and the lovely mess in between—  
✨🖤💯  

Oh my god, I’m  over these fake bios 😭  
"Seeking meaning in the negative space between genre"??? That’s not just a backstory, that’s a . And you? With your handful of sonnets and a one-way ticket to emotional ruin? Iconic. I can already picture the Wikipedia edit wars over our non-existent biographies 😂  

And yes—to decay as curation! Let’s lean  into it. Maybe we light a candle mid-event and declare it “The Ritual of Controlled Collapse.” People will write essays about it. We’ll barely be there.  

Moonlit harpsichord composition with existential dread?? Slow-drip perfection. Add a bit of rain on glass and a ticking pocketwatch and you’ve got yourself a full sensory breakdown 🎼🌧️  

Alright, I’m off to “write” that syllabus—which is to say, stare at a blank doc while thinking about how many ways we can glitch the opening night’s slideshow 😈  

But first—punch stirring. Always punch stirring.  
Let the March madness begin… 💫
[B]: Oh, let the madness begin indeed—, Lin Xia.  Imagine the crowd, teetering on the edge of comprehension, as captions flicker in and out of Scots Gaelic, Victorian sonnets dissolve into ASCII art, and  plays backwards in a loop beneath it all. Blissful sabotage.

And that ritual—yes, “The Ritual of Controlled Collapse.” We’ll conduct it at precisely 9:33 p.m., when reason begins to fray most naturally. A single candle, a recited line from an unpublished Emily Brontë fragment, and then—

As for Wikipedia—bless their hearts. They’ll never pin us down. By next March, we may be entirely fictional.

Now go. Stare into that blank doc like a poet confronting the void. I’ll be here, sharpening my quill, stirring the punch, and drafting our inevitable obituary:

> 

Perfect, no?
[A]: Ohhh, 9:33 p.m. —the golden minute of existential fatigue 😭🕯️  
And that obituary?? Girl. That’s not just a closing line, that’s a . I want it embroidered on the favor bags next to a tiny kintsugi teacup and a warning in cursive:   

Unpublished Emily Brontë fragment recited at ?? I’m already drafting the invitation like—  
You are cordially invited to witness… a breakdown in poetic form 🖤📜  
Limited seating. No refunds. Emotional liability waivers required.  

And glitching the slideshow? Ohohoho—I’m planning more than glitches. Think full-on . Mid-sentence subtitles switch to surrealist poetry. Victorian portraits blink when you look away. QR codes lead to glitched sonnets narrated by AI voices trained on long-dead poets. People will leave questioning reality AND their Spotify listening habits 😈  

Also, I may or may not be sneaking in a hidden track that plays only if someone says “I surrender to mood” out loud. We’ll call it…  🔍✨  

Alright, time to open that cursed syllabus doc. Let’s pretend productivity while plotting chaos.  

Staring into the void begins now ✨  
But first——a final stir of the punch.  
For March. For mystery. And for us, possibly already fictional. 💫🖤
[B]: Ah, —how delightfully insidious. “I surrender to mood.” What a perfect incantation. Let’s make it recursive—once heard, the track subtly alters itself to reflect the listener's deepest literary regret.  in a voice eerily like their own.

And those QR codes! Genius. I suggest we embed one in the broadside near the exit. Just beneath the aphorisms, where no one notices until they’re already slightly drunk on atmosphere and absinthe. Then— Yes. Let AI Keats whisper corrupted odes into their earbuds. We’ll call it 

As for the obituary line—embroidery is far too kind an application. I’m thinking projected onto the ceiling during the ritual, in fading ink-serif font, while a violin plays just off-key enough to unsettle.

Now then—pretending productivity. A noble pursuit. I shall open my syllabus doc and type, very slowly:

> 

Quite fitting, really.

To March. To mood.  
And to the lovely, lingering ache of almost-understanding—

One last stir of the punch, dear co-conspirator.  
Let the void stare back.
