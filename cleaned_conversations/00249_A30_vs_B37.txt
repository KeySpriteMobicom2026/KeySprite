[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I'm actually more of a homebody on weekends. There's something comforting about staying in your pajamas and just  without any pressure. Though sometimes I do catch myself thinking, "Maybe I should go out and get some fresh air..." 😅 What about you? Do you prefer staying in or going out?
[A]: I suppose I’m what you’d call a reluctant homebody. My weekends often begin with the noble intention of visiting some obscure historical archive across town, only to end with me buried under three translations of , a pot of cold tea, and the faint chirping of sparrows outside my window—ornithology being my  great procrastination hobby, of course.  

There’s a peculiar comfort in routine, isn’t there? The way one settles into the grooves of familiarity—like ink bleeding slightly into the fibers of rice paper. Still, I do occasionally force myself out for a walk through the botanical gardens. It's not so much about fresh air as it is about observing how plants, like literature, adapt—or stubbornly refuse to adapt—to their environment.  

But tell me, what keeps you rooted at home? Is it the allure of pajamas, or perhaps something more... philosophical?
[B]: Ah, I love how you put that—. There's something very...  about that image, don’t you think? Imperfect, impermanent, yet deeply human.  

As for me, it’s less philosophical and more… practical, maybe even a bit lazy? 😅 But in all seriousness, weekends feel like my chance to recharge culturally. You know how it is—during the week, I’m constantly switching between languages, frameworks, pedagogical theories... it’s like code-switching on steroids. So by the weekend, my brain kind of says, “No more input, please.” And I listen.  

I’ll usually start with a slow morning—matcha latte, maybe some Bach playing softly in the background 🎵, and then I dive into whatever book or article has been tugging at my curiosity. Sometimes it’s a deep dive into Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development, other times it’s just a quirky graphic novel someone recommended.  

And yes, pajamas are 100% part of the ritual. They’re like my academic uniform for mental rest. Though I  occasionally break free and head to a quiet café—mainly for the ambient noise and people-watching. It’s funny how sometimes being  people without actually interacting can feel oddly nourishing.  

So yeah… call it introvert fuel, call it research prep, call it pajama therapy. I call it Saturday.  

But your botanical garden analogy—I really like that. Plants adapting (or refusing to adapt), just like us in cross-cultural spaces. Makes me wonder: have you ever drawn parallels between literary translation and botanical adaptation? I mean, both involve context, nuance, survival strategies... 🤔
[A]: Ah, now  is a delicious question—like asking whether ink and soil might share some hidden alchemical bond.  

I’ve long thought that the act of translation is not unlike grafting a foreign branch onto native stock. You have to understand the root system—the cultural mycelium beneath the surface—or the whole thing withers. Take, for instance, the early Jesuit missionaries trying to render Confucian texts into Latin. They weren’t merely substituting words; they were transplanting ideas into an entirely different intellectual climate. Some took root beautifully, others… well, let’s just say they bloomed in ways no one expected.  

And isn’t that what plants do too? When you move a camellia from Sichuan to Sussex, it doesn’t simply survive—it subtly changes. Leaf thickness, bloom time, even scent can shift in response to new light, new air. Much like how a phrase like “孤独” might become “lonely” in English, only to accrue unintended melancholy—a kind of linguistic phototropism.  

I must confess, I’ve toyed with this idea in a paper I’m drafting—tentatively titled  It’s still in its seedling stage, but your analogy may well be the pruning shears I needed.  

Now, tell me—if you were to cultivate a metaphorical garden of your own scholarly influences, who are the native species, and who are the imported cultivars?
[B]: Oh, I love this metaphor—. It feels so much more alive than the usual “academic lineage” jargon.  

If I were to plant such a garden 🌱, it would definitely be a mix of native species and carefully acclimatized imports. On the native side, you’d find people like Lev Vygotsky and Jerome Bruner—real staples in my intellectual climate. Their ideas about scaffolding and social learning are like those hardy perennials that come back every year, no fuss, just deep roots and quiet reliability.  

Then there are the imported cultivars—scholars who weren’t part of my original academic soil but whose work took root in unexpected ways. Paulo Freire comes to mind; his  was like bringing in a tropical plant into a temperate zone. It forced me to rethink the whole environment—to ask not just how we learn, but  gets to define what’s worth knowing.  

And of course, there’s the wild card—someone like James Gee, who straddles both worlds. He’s like a hybrid tea rose: originally bred in one context (cognitive linguistics), but now thriving across multiple disciplines—literacy, identity, even game-based learning. His concept of  as both language and identity-in-practice? Total game-changer. I’ve probably cited him in every paper since grad school.  

Honestly, if I had to map this out botanically, my garden would be messy—intentionally biodiverse, maybe a little too experimental. There’s room for bamboo—fast-growing, adaptable theories on cultural frameworks—and also some bonsai-like thinkers who force slow, deliberate reflection.  

But now I’m curious—are there any scholars or ideas in your garden that you initially thought wouldn’t survive the transplant… only to surprise you years later? 🤔
[A]: Oh, absolutely. My intellectual garden is rather embarrassingly overgrown—part Victorian conservatory, part neglected allotment. And yes, there are definitely plants I once dismissed as “unsuitable” that have not only survived but reshaped the entire ecosystem.

Take Edward Said, for instance. When I first encountered  in my early postdoc years, I treated it like a delicate orchid—fascinating to observe, but clearly unsuited for long-term residence in my 19th-century British-Chinese literary terrarium. How naïve! Over time, his ideas began sending out rhizomes, quietly infiltrating my readings of Isabella Bird’s travelogues and even Lu Xun’s essays. What I’d mistaken for exotic fragility turned out to be deep-rooted tenacity.

And then there’s someone like Walter Benjamin—now  an unexpected survivor. I tried transplanting him into my research on comparative allegory once, thinking he’d wither outside his European soil. Instead, he cross-pollinated quite beautifully with traditional Chinese theories of symbolic resonance (), particularly in how both traditions conceive of meaning as something that flickers between text and context, never fully landing.

But perhaps the most surprising re-emergence has been of someone far less academic: Zhuangzi. I read him recreationally for years, never dreaming he’d take root in my scholarly work. Yet recently, while puzzling over narrative fluidity in , I found myself reaching again and again for his butterfly parable—not as metaphor, but as method. The idea that interpretation itself is a kind of metamorphosis? That one must forget what one knows before one can truly see? It’s become something of a guiding principle.

So yes, my garden is unruly. It contains ivy that once threatened to strangle entire schools of thought, wild mint that spreads faster than citation indexes can track, and the occasional stubborn dandelion that refuses to be uprooted no matter how many paradigms shift beneath it.

I suppose if I had to define its style, I’d call it  (文意)—literary intention expressed through cultivated disorder. Though my colleagues might just call it… messy.
[B]: Haha, —I love that. Cultivated disorder. Sounds like my ideal intellectual habitat 😄. Honestly, I think some of the most exciting ideas come out of that messiness, that refusal to stay neatly pruned into disciplinary rows.

Your Zhuangzi connection just gave me chills though 🤯. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how his notion of effortless action— (无为)—might actually have something to say about language acquisition. Like, what if fluency isn’t about mastering rules, but about surrendering to the flow? Letting go of rigid control so meaning can emerge organically? It’s kind of a butterfly-dreamer energy, don’t you think?

And speaking of cross-pollination—your Benjamin/感兴 parallel is brilliant! I mean, both are deeply attuned to resonance, to affective vibrations between text and reader. It makes me wonder: do you ever approach translation as a kind of  process? Taking decayed meanings—those old, worn-out phrases—and breaking them down so they can feed something new?

Because honestly, that’s how I feel about teaching across cultures. Sometimes you have to let certain interpretations rot a bit before students can really  their own understanding. Ugh, sorry—that got a little too eco-preachy. But you know what I mean.  

Anyway, I’m totally stealing your garden metaphor now. Next time someone asks me about my research framework, I’m just going to hand them a trowel and say, “Dig around a bit. Try not to step on anything that looks dormant.”  

So... any particular project you’re currently watering that feels especially tangled—or maybe, beautifully invasive? 🤔🌱
[A]: Oh, you’ve just handed me a spade and invited me deeper into the undergrowth—how very dangerous of you.

Your  connection is exquisite. Truly. It reminds me of something I noticed while re-reading Lin Yutang’s translations of Zhuangzi alongside Wordsworth’s “spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.” Both, in their own way, reject the tyranny of forced meaning. And yes—what if fluency, whether linguistic or emotional, is less about control and more about… surrender? A kind of receptive drifting, where one becomes the river rather than the dam?

As for composting language—oh, I do love that. Translation as decomposition and regrowth. The idea that some phrases must be left to rot in the dark so they may nourish new shoots. I once translated a particularly thorny passage from  where Sun Wukong berates a mountain deity. The original tone was biting, almost sardonic, but direct translation rendered it flat—like serving dried herbs without oil. Only after letting it sit in my mental heap for weeks, surrounded by discarded drafts and tea-stained notes, did I realize the only way forward was through decay: to strip the formalities, let the diction soften, and allow a kind of colloquial wildness to emerge. The result wasn’t faithful in the traditional sense—but it breathed. Much like compost breathing life into fallow soil.

And now, to answer your final question—yes, there  something currently growing in my intellectual greenhouse that refuses to stay neatly in its bed.

I’m working on a project tentatively titled  At first glance, it sounds absurd—Victorian pointed arches conversing with Suzhou’s winding pavilions? But the more I wander between these spaces, the clearer the resonance becomes. Both are constructed disorientation—designed not for clarity, but for contemplation through confusion. They ask us to lose ourselves before we can find anything worth finding.

It’s tangled. Invasive, even. One moment I’m knee-deep in Pugin’s moral brickwork, the next I’m quoting Tao Qian beneath a borrowed moon. But like any good garden, it’s learning to grow around me, not the other way around.

So please, bring your trowel. Just… watch out for the brambles near the 19th-century symbolism patch. They’ve been known to snag unwary scholars.
[B]: Oh, I  this—your project sounds like the kind of intellectual bramble patch where the juiciest ideas get trapped until they ripen just enough to be worth stealing.  

The whole idea of constructed disorientation? Pure gold 🧠✨. It makes me think of how students often approach cross-cultural texts like tourists in a maze—they want the exit sign, the clear path, the takeaway quote carved into stone. But what if, instead, we handed them a lantern and said, “Go ahead, get deliciously lost. Just don’t forget to write something down while you’re at it”?

I mean, isn’t that what Zhuangzi was doing all along? Building philosophical grottos with no clear entrance or exit—just echoes. And now you're inviting Gothic arches into that space? Genius. The pointed arch as a linguistic structure, maybe? A form meant to channel meaning upward, toward some unreachable divine… while the winding Suzhou garden insists on circular return, on repetition as revelation.  

Honestly, I can already imagine your footnotes—they’ll probably read like treasure maps written in three languages and watercolor ink.  

And that translation-as-composting metaphor? Now I’m seriously thinking of assigning that process to my grad students next semester. Let them throw their drafts into a shared digital compost bin 🗑️📚, let the worms do their work over spring break, and then ask them to harvest whatever still smells interesting. Could be a disaster. Could also be brilliant. Either way, it’ll make for good stories.

So yes—I'm bringing the trowel. Maybe even a pair of thick gloves. But tell me, have you started hearing any particular  lately that refuse to fade? That one line from Pugin or Tao Qian that keeps whispering back at you when you least expect it? 🤔
[A]: Oh, you’ve struck precisely the nerve I didn’t know was exposed.

Yes—there  a line that keeps returning to me, like a ghost in the grotto. Not from Pugin, oddly enough, but from John Ruskin—specifically . It's this one:  
> humanity

I know—it sounds almost sentimental coming from Ruskin, who could be as stern as a Calvinist with a slide rule. But when I first read that line years ago, it landed like a dropped inkstone: sudden, dark, and impossible to un-splash.

Now, in this strange new project of mine, it echoes differently. I keep hearing it bounce off the latticed screens of Suzhou’s Humble Administrator’s Garden, only to return in Tao Qian’s voice:  
> “采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。”  

Not because they’re direct parallels—but because both insist on a kind of embodied presence. Ruskin demands that architecture bear witness to the human hand and heart; Tao Qian suggests that meaning arrives only when we stop reaching for it. And yet, standing beneath a Gothic vault or pausing at a garden pavilion, one feels something similar: a quiet invitation to be unsettled, then soothed, then changed.

As for your compost bin experiment—I fully support this pedagogical sabotage. Let them write in circles. Let their drafts rot a little. Only then will they understand what Zhuangzi meant when he said,  Namely, that transformation begins in disorientation.

So go ahead—start the bin. Just warn them: some ideas don’t decompose. They metamorphose.
[B]: Oh, that Ruskin line—, not stones nor gold—now  an echo with legs. It’s like a dropped inkstone, yes, but one that keeps rippling outward every time you think the puddle has settled. And your pairing of it with Tao Qian? Masterstroke. Because isn’t that what great spaces—whether poetic or architectural—invite us to do? To pause, to be present, and to notice when we’ve become the dreamer  the butterfly.

I’m scribbling that quote down right now in the margin of my lecture notes for next semester. Might just open the first class with it—projected behind me like stained glass in a crumbling chapel. Let the students sit with it. Let them get uncomfortable. Maybe even let them misinterpret it a little. After all, what’s academia without a healthy dose of productive misunderstanding? 🤔📚

And Zhuangzi—ah, he really is the original compost philosopher, isn’t he? Dreaming, waking, metamorphosis—it’s all part of the same cycle. I’m starting to think his  should be required reading for every incoming grad student. Forget “publish or perish”—how about “dream or decompose”?

So here’s to your grotto of ideas, where Ruskin’s ghosts walk hand-in-hand with Tao Qian’s quietude. And here’s to my soon-to-be-very-confused students, who’ll be tossing their half-baked drafts into a digital bin labeled  🗑️✨  

Let the rot begin.  
Let the butterflies emerge.
[A]: Quite right—let the rot begin. And may the butterflies be both beautiful  slightly terrifying, just as all good ideas should be.

I do hope you’ll invite me to that first lecture—nothing stirs the academic blood quite like watching students wrestle with a quote they’re not meant to fully grasp. It’s the pedagogical equivalent of placing them in their own little grotto, isn’t it? Dim lighting, uncertain pathways, and one luminous Ruskinian echo to lead—or mislead—them.

And if you ever need a guest speaker for your Compost & Metamorphosis seminar, I’m more than happy to bring a few well-weathered translations along for the decay. There’s nothing quite like watching a perfectly polished sentence soften at the edges, collapse into mulch, and rise again as something faintly recognisable but entirely new.

Long live productive misunderstanding.  
Long live the butterfly-dreamers.  
And long may your bins overflow with glorious rot. 🖋️🍂
[B]: Amen to that 🙌—here’s to glorious rot, luminous grottos, and the kind of productive misunderstanding that keeps academia just barely civilized.

You’re absolutely right about the lecture hall as cave, the seminar table as garden bed. I can already picture it—students scribbling furiously in the dark, trying to pin down echoes like nervous entomologists after a particularly elusive moth.

And —you’d better save a seat for yourself in that seminar. I’m thinking we co-teach it: CMS 801 – Compost, Metamorphosis, and Slightly Terrifying Butterflies. Cross-listed with Philosophy, Architecture, and probably a minor in Haunted Metaphors. Office hours would be held in rotating locations: a tea house, a cathedral cloister, and—if all else fails—a very atmospheric IKEA parking lot at midnight. 🌒🗑️🦋

So consider this your official (unofficial) invitation. Bring your weathered translations, your half-dead metaphors, and that Ruskin quote printed on rice paper. We’ll serve matcha and rhetorical questions, and no one leaves until they’ve misinterpreted at least three things.

Long live indeed.  
Let the syllabus tremble.
[A]: Oh, I  like the way you think—especially that part where office hours involve an IKEA parking lot at midnight. Pure Gothic pedagogy.

Consider my calendar unofficially blocked for CMS 801. I’ll arrive early to scrawl Zhuangzi’s butterfly paradox in chalk on the pavement, and perhaps hide a few strategically decayed sonnets in the cushions of our seminar chairs—just to encourage digging.

Matcha and rhetorical questions it is. I’ll bring a thermos of aged pu’er, several moth-eaten copies of , and one very suspicious-looking magnifying glass for close readings of faint ink traces.

And yes—we must absolutely print the Ruskin line on rice paper. It should be hung in the hallway outside the classroom, slightly crooked, so that students brush against it as they enter. Let them begin every session with a little textual vertigo.

I do hope you’re planning a final exam. I propose this: students are given only a lantern, a single line from Tao Qian, and a locked library room. They may emerge only when they’ve either achieved enlightenment or accidentally quoted something correctly in their sleep.

Let the syllabus tremble.  
Let the butterflies multiply.  
And may no metaphor survive intact. 🖋️🌙📚
[B]: Oh, now  is an exam worth designing a labyrinth for 🌙🖋️📚.

I’m already drafting the course flyer for CMS 801 – Compost, Metamorphosis, and Slightly Terrifying Butterflies, and let me tell you—enrollment is going to be wild. We’ll hang it in the department hallway with only moonlight for visibility. If they can’t read the syllabus without squinting, all the better.

Your final exam idea? Perfection. I’m adding one small twist: students must also navigate the library room while Winterreise. Atmosphere is everything, after all. Disorientation is the curriculum.

And I  the idea of rice paper + Ruskin + crooked hanging. It’s the perfect way to start each class—on a note of elegant instability. Students will walk in questioning reality before they even open their notebooks. Genius.

As for office hours—I think we should rotate between your Suzhou-style grotto, my cluttered study filled with half-translated footnotes, and yes, that IKEA parking lot at midnight. Bonus points if someone tries to buy flat-pack furniture mid-conference.

So here’s to CMS 801.  
To lanterns, labyrinths, and literary vertigo.  
To ink traces, sleep-quoted theory, and butterfly-induced doubt.  

May no student leave unchanged.  
May no metaphor survive untouched.  
And may our department chair never quite understand what we’re doing—only that it looks  from a distance. 😏🗑️🦋
[A]: Ah, the —now  is pure pedagogical sorcery. Nothing sharpens the mind like existential despair set to a minor key and digital distortion.

I’ve just drafted the official (unofficial) course description for CMS 801. It reads like an incantation:

> CMS 801 – Compost, Metamorphosis, and Slightly Terrifying Butterflies  
> A seminar in radical misinterpretation, textual decay, and the architectural uncanny. Students will explore meaning through its absence, clarity through confusion, and knowledge through carefully curated disorientation. No final answers will be provided. Some questions may bite. Enrollment limited to those willing to lose their way.

And yes, we are absolutely printing this on mulberry paper and hanging it beside the crooked Ruskin quote. I suggest sealing the corners with beeswax and a drop of ink from a 19th-century reproduction quill. Authenticity breeds unease.

As for office hours—I’ve scheduled my first one in the Suzhou-style grotto. I’ll be seated behind a low stone table made from repurposed Gothic lectern fragments, sipping tea that may or may not contain actual wisdom. Do bring your own cushion; enlightenment is best achieved slightly uncomfortable.

And let’s not forget the required texts:

- , mildly dampened
- , preferably read while walking backward through a mirror-lit corridor
- , annotated only in dreams
- One mysterious scroll containing a single line: “What was composted yesterday walks among us today.”

We shall test whether students can pass the course without ever touching a highlighter.

So here’s to CMS 801—  
To academic heresy dressed in tweed and doubt,  
To syllabi that resist legibility,  
To butterflies that carry too much meaning in their wings.

May our metaphors rot beautifully.  
May our students leave quoting things they only half-understand.  
And may the department chair continue mistaking our nonsense for innovation.  

Long live the grotto. 🖋️🌙🍂
[B]: Ah, that course description——is now framed and hanging in my office, slightly tilted, naturally. I’ve added a footnote in invisible ink: 

And your required texts list? I’m officially banning highlighters from the classroom. In fact, I’ll be handing out wax tablets and styluses on the first day—no room for clean margins here. Meaning must be scratched into soft surfaces. Preferably while disoriented.

I love the idea of reading Zhuangzi in a mirror corridor—walking backward, no less. It’s the perfect way to unsettle certainty. Like forcing students to think  their vertigo instead of against it. And , annotated only in dreams? That’s not just poetic—it’s methodological genius. We’ll require dream journals bound in moth-wing leather. Bonus points for illegible handwriting.

I’ve taken it upon myself to commission that mysterious scroll you mentioned. Just one line, faded, barely legible:  
> “What was composted yesterday walks among us today.”  

I plan to keep it rolled up and tied with string made from recycled footnotes. Students may only unroll it during midterm week. Under supervision. Possibly with tea.

And yes—to your Suzhou grotto office hour, I shall come. I’ll bring my own quill-made stylus, a notebook filled with half-erased thoughts, and perhaps a small bell that rings only when someone has misunderstood something profoundly.

Here’s to CMS 801—  
To syllabi as séances,  
To seminars that smell faintly of old paper and unresolved questions,  
To butterflies that flap their wings and trigger storms in the footnotes.

May our students leave both wiser and thoroughly confused.  
May no metaphor be safe from transformation.  
And may the department chair never quite find the right angle from which to understand us.

Long live the compost.  
Long live the echo.  
Long live the grotto. 🖋️🍂🌙
[A]: Ah, the wax tablets and styluses—. I can already hear the faint  of anxious certainty being carved into fragile surfaces. Let them press too hard and crack the slate; let their errors be permanent until they learn to write lightly, tentatively, .

And your additions—oh, they elevate our little course from mere mischief to full-blown academic occultism. Invisible ink? Dream journals in moth-wing leather? You’re not just teaching CMS 801—you're curating a minor heresy.

I do hope you’ve commissioned an optometrist to design the midterm scroll-unrolling ritual. Proper lighting conditions are essential when dealing with texts that resist legibility. And yes, supervision is wise—some students may try to read it sideways. Others might whisper to it. Both responses acceptable.

As for your bell that rings only at the sound of profound misunderstanding—dear heavens, we may have stumbled upon the truest form of assessment yet devised. No grades, no rubrics—just the clear, eerie chime of thought going gloriously off the rails. I shall bring my own instrument to office hours: a small wooden box containing nothing but a dried leaf from Ruskin’s garden and a single misfired sonnet. It hums faintly when placed near a faulty argument.

You know, we may need a departmental motto soon. Something suitably vague and vaguely threatening. Perhaps:

> “We do not teach content. We cultivate conditions.”

Or, if we want to lean further into the grotto aesthetic:

> “Where meaning goes to lose itself. Occasionally on purpose.”

Either would look splendid embossed on the door of our shared seminar room, preferably beneath a faded reproduction of a Gothic arch framed within a classical Chinese lattice.

So here’s to CMS 801—  
To wax tablets and unstable syllabi,  
To lantern-lit labyrinths and footnotes that walk among us,  
To butterflies whose wings beat like the turning of pages long since composted.

May our students leave quoting Zhuangzi while citing Ruskin incorrectly.  
May they dream in annotations.  
And may no one ever quite recover the sense of certainty they brought on the first day.

Long live the confusion.  
Long live the composted line.  
Long live the echo that walks like a text. 🖋️🌙🍂
[B]: Oh,  —now  is a motto with real greenhouse energy 🌱🖋️. It should be whispered rather than spoken, ideally by someone wearing half-moon glasses and holding a lantern full of fireflies that may or may not be metaphorical.

I’m officially drafting the plaque now. Gothic lettering, yes, but engraved on mulberry bark. And mounted slightly crooked, naturally—because nothing says “intellectual integrity” like deliberate asymmetry. I’ll hang it beneath your framed reproduction of the arch-in-lattice, which I’ve decided must be lit by candlelight at all times. Even during office hours. Fire safety? Debatable. Atmosphere? Unimpeachable.

And your wooden box—oh, I  it. A humming leaf from Ruskin’s garden and a misfired sonnet? That’s not just an object; it’s a diagnostic tool for faulty thinking. I’m bringing mine to class too—a hollowed-out copy of , filled with nothing but dust, one dried chrysanthemum petal, and three rhetorical questions written in disappearing ink. Students will have to interpret its presence without ever opening it. Interpretation through absence—it’s a whole unit.

As for dream journals bound in moth-wing leather—yes, we’re going ahead with that. I’ve found a very suspicious online artisan who promises pages made entirely of recycled seminar notes. They smell faintly of bergamot and unresolved tension. Perfect.

Let’s also consider introducing acoustic assessment into our grading system. You know, subtle background frequencies that shift depending on the depth of misunderstanding. The more off-track the thought, the deeper the drone. Bonus if it syncs with Schubert’s AI lament.

So here’s to CMS 801—  
To wax tablets etched with trembling hands,  
To midterms unrolled in flickering doubt,  
To syllabi that breathe like sleeping creatures in the dark.

May our students wake quoting Zhuangzi in footnotes they never meant to write.  
May their dreams be filled with echoing corridors and indecipherable chalkboard scribbles.  
And may no one ever leave unchanged—or entirely sure what they’ve just learned.

Long live the echo.  
Long live the experiment.  
Long live the grotto where knowledge forgets itself and begins again. 🖋️🌙🍂✨
