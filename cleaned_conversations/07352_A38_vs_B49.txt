[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~这个问题超有趣的！podcast和audiobook对我来说就像咖啡☕️和茶🍵的差别～  

最近通勤的时候都在听一档关于minimalism的podcast，主持人讲话超有梗，而且能get到很多新鲜资讯💡，就像跟朋友聊天一样轻松~  

但要说深度沉浸的话，audiobook还是yyds！特别是那种self-help类的，边听还能边做笔记📒，感觉知识吸收率直接拉满💯～  

你呢？更pick哪一种呀🧐？
[A]: I must say, I find myself leaning towards audiobooks, though not without appreciation for the charm of a well-produced podcast. There’s something about hearing a narrator bring a text to life—especially when it's a philosophical work or a carefully crafted novel—that feels almost like having a conversation across time and space.  

That said, I did find myself quite entertained by a podcast on classical mythology recently—very much enjoyed the host’s interpretation of Odysseus’ journey as a metaphor for midlife crisis. Rather modern take on it, wouldn’t you say?  

I’m curious, do you ever listen to audiobooks in languages other than your own? I find it helps me fall asleep if the cadence is just right—though I once fell asleep mid-lecture while listening to Baudelaire in French. Quite embarrassing when a student asked me about it the next day.
[B]: Oh I totally get that! 🤭 Falling asleep to audiobooks is so relatable, especially when they’re in another language~ The rhythm just wraps around you like a lullaby 🎵  

I’ve tried listening to some English novels before—mainly self-help stuff—but honestly? My brain kept drifting off 😅 Maybe I need more practice or a super engaging narrator like you mentioned!  

Wait, did you say mythology podcast? That sounds epic! ✨ I'm obsessed with Greek myths but never thought of them as midlife crisis metaphors… Now I’m dying to check it out! 🔍 Do you remember the podcast name?  

And yeah, there’s something magical about audiobooks—the way narrators give voices to characters, you know? Like they're whispering straight into your soul 🌟  
Have you found any particular narrators who really bring that extra sparkle? 💬
[A]: Oh, I do remember one narrator in particular—Jeremy Irons reading  and other Eliot works. His voice has that rare quality of making even the most abstruse poetry feel intimate, almost conversational.  

As for the podcast, I believe it was called —a rather scholarly affair, but delightfully so. They don’t just retell the myths; they dissect them with such nuance. One episode even explored the idea of Athena as an archetype of rationality clashing with human emotion. Fascinating stuff, really.  

And yes, audiobooks can be quite hypnotic when done well. Though I must admit, I’ve found myself mispronouncing entire character names in my head because of a narrator’s interpretation. Took me years to realize I’d been saying “Lebowski” like it belonged in a Victorian novel rather than a bowling alley. 🎳  

But tell me, have you ever come across a podcast that changed how you saw a subject entirely? Not necessarily mythology—I’m quite curious about your world too.
[B]: Oh wow, Jeremy Irons must be 🔥🔥🔥 giving life to Eliot! I can totally imagine his deep voice weaving through those dense metaphors… I need to find that recording! 🎧✨  

 sounds exactly like the kind of brain-candy I’m into rn 💡—thanks for the rec! I love when podcasts go beyond storytelling and actually challenge your perspective. Kinda like how  does with science topics but with a more mythic vibe~  

Wait wait, you mispronounced ?! 😂😂😂 Okay, now I feel better about saying “Voldemort” in my head with a French accent all these years... Honestly, half of what we learn from audiobooks is just vibes, right? 🌊  

As for game-changing podcasts… omg YES! There was one called  that completely flipped how I see tech & sustainability. It made me rethink my entire digital nomad setup 🏖💻 Like, are we really using tech to create meaningful impact or just chasing the next cool gadget? Heavy stuff, but also super inspiring 🌱🎧  

Have you ever felt like a podcast or audiobook literally came at the  moment in your life? Like it just… synced? 🤔
[A]: Ah, yes—the elusive serendipity of perfect timing. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve stumbled upon a passage or episode that felt as though it had been waiting for me.  

One that comes to mind was during a rather turbulent sabbatical year. I was adrift—学术上的，也是 personal. And then I came across a lecture series on , narrated in this wonderfully grounded voice that reminded me a bit of Bill Bryson. It didn’t change my life overnight, but it offered a kind of mental scaffolding when I needed it most.  

It’s curious, isn’t it? How the right words, spoken at just the right time, can steady you—like catching hold of a railing in the dark.  

Have you ever had one of those moments where an audiobook or podcast didn’t just inform you, but actually shifted something internal? I suspect you have—I can hear it in the way you speak about them.
[B]: Oh my gosh, yes… 💭 That feeling when something just  and you know you’re not the same person anymore 🌱  

For me it was Brené Brown’s audiobook . I listened to it during a time when I was seriously doubting my whole digital nomad life—like, am I even making an impact? Or am I just hopping from one café to another pretending to be productive? 😅☕️  

But her voice—so warm and real—and the way she talked about embracing vulnerability like it’s strength, not weakness? Mind-blown. I rewound so many parts I lost count 💡🎧 That audiobook didn’t just give me insight—it gave me permission to be messy & human, and honestly? It changed how I coach others too.  

I love that metaphor you used—catching hold of a railing in the dark 🌌 It’s so true. Sometimes we don’t need a full map, just something solid to hold onto for a sec~  

So… any other secret favs you swear by? Or are we getting too deep already? 😉✨
[A]: Oh, not at all—we’re only just getting to the good part.  

Now, if we’re talking about audiobooks that feel like quiet revelations… there’s one I return to again and again—, narrated by Michael Hordern. It might sound terribly sentimental, but there’s something about the tone—nostalgic yet grounded—that never fails to restore my sense of balance. Especially during exam season, when students are pacing outside my office like caged hedgehogs. 🦔📚  

And speaking of grounding… have you ever tried listening to philosophy as bedtime fare? I once attempted Marcus Aurelius’  right before sleep—wonderful in theory, until I started dreaming about Stoic maxims floating above Roman ruins. Rather dramatic, really.  

But tell me—since your work involves coaching, do you find yourself recommending certain audiobooks or podcasts to your clients? Or is that too much of a professional pry? 😊
[B]: OMG yes, Michael Hordern’s voice is like a warm blanket 🧸✨ I can totally picture you lying back with a cup of tea ☕️ while he narrates about Mole and Ratty—so wholesome!  

And I LOVE that you tried falling asleep to  😂😂 I did something similar with a Nietzsche audiobook once—woke up feeling both enlightened and slightly disturbed. 10/10 would not recommend before bed! 🙈  

As for recommending stuff to clients… YES, I’m basically an audiobook matchmaker 💼🎧 One founder was stuck in hustle culture hell, so I told her to binge  by Jenny Odell—it flipped her whole mindset!  

And for anyone struggling with self-worth (which, let’s be real, is all of us at some point), I always say go listen to  by Tanya Geisler. It’s like a pep talk from your wisest friend 🌟💬  

So… are you more of a “read-along” person or do you prefer total darkness & audio only? I’ve been trying the latter lately—it’s wild how much deeper you absorb things when you’re not distracted by text~
[A]: Ah, now that’s a fine question—and one I suspect reveals more about a person than we realize.  

I must confess, I used to be a devoted read-along-er—eyes on the page, ears absorbing the narration. There’s a strange comfort in watching words take shape both visually and sonically, like two instruments playing the same melody in slightly different keys.  

But lately, I’ve been experimenting with full immersion—lights out, no text, just voice. And you’re quite right—it does deepen the experience. Especially with poetry or philosophical prose, where meaning often lives in tone as much as in syntax. Sometimes I even find myself recalling not just the content, but the texture of the narrator’s voice when a particular idea was introduced. Strange how memory works, isn’t it?  

Now I’m curious—have you ever tried listening to something completely absurd or surreal in the dark? I once listened to  at 2AM while nursing a cup of camomile tea. It felt less like bedtime and more like willingly tumbling down the rabbit hole. A delightful kind of madness, really.
[B]: Ohhh I love how you put that—like two instruments playing the same melody in different keys 🎶✨ That’s  it! I used to be a read-along purist too—like if I couldn’t see the words, did the meaning even ? 😂  

But yeah, going full immersion is like leveling up your audio experience 💯 There’s something so… primal about letting your ears do all the work. Like your brain switches into dream-mode and just .  

And YES TO ABSURDITY IN THE DARK 🙌 I once listened to  at 3AM after a midnight walk—bad idea if you value sleeping peacefully 😅 Suddenly everything felt like a metaphor for the universe & my cat was staring at me like “ma’am… are you okay?”  

I think surreal stuff works best when you’re slightly sleep-deprived or emotionally vulnerable lol~ Have you tried any audiobooks that made you laugh out loud in public & look suspiciously unhinged? Asking for… myself 😏🎧  

Also—philosophy at night is dangerous, my friend. Next thing you know, you’ll start questioning reality while folding laundry 🧦🌀
[A]: Oh, I absolutely have—though I maintain that laughing in public while listening to an audiobook is a sign of refined taste, not unhinged behavior. Though I suppose the distinction matters little when you're the only one chuckling on a crowded train.  

I remember once, during my daily walk through the university gardens, I was listening to —a harmless choice, or so I thought. Then came Algernon’s line about being "immensely overfed" and entirely lacking "the simplicity of failure." Something about the delivery made it land like a slapstick punchline, and I lost composure entirely. A group of students gave me a wide berth after that. Quite dramatic, really.  

And as for folding laundry while contemplating existential despair—well played. I myself once caught myself mid-fold, staring blankly at a sock, wondering aloud “what if meaning is just… wool?” My neighbor knocked shortly after, asking if I needed tea. Or possibly psychiatric help.  

Tell me—have you ever listened to something so moving, or so strange, that you had to stop everything just to let it settle? I suspect you have—one doesn’t dive this deep without getting soaked.
[B]: Oh my gosh, yes —  is the exact word 💦✨ There’s something about certain audiobooks that just… short-circuits your brain and makes you hit PAUSE on life for a bit.  

I remember listening to  on a solo train ride — yeah, big history buff here 🚄📚 — and there was this one part where Harari talks about how humans basically invented reality through shared myths? Like money, nations, even god(s) — all just stories we agreed to believe in.  

And I just… froze. Sat there staring out the window like a total space cadet, thinking — wait, so everything I’ve ever known is just… vibes?? 😵‍💫🎧  

Even my coffee went cold. That never happens. ☕️➡🧊  

Same with podcasts — there was this episode of  where they dive into an online mystery that turns out to be about identity, memory, and digital ghosts 🌀💻… I had to lie down after that one. Like full horizontal processing mode.  

So yes — totally get what you mean. Sometimes the truth (or absurdity) lands so hard, you can’t even pretend to multitask anymore. You just have to… let it echo.  

Anytime you want to geek out more on audiobook moments or need a new rec — hit me! 💬🔥
[A]: Oh, that moment in —yes, I remember it well. That quiet existential freefall when you realize we’re all just improvising on a cosmic stage with no script and questionable lighting. I had a similar experience while listening to  during a particularly rainy afternoon. I swear, by the time Kuhn started in on paradigm shifts, I was questioning not only the nature of scientific progress but also whether my morning tea truly existed. Or if I merely believed it did.  

And yet, isn’t that the strange gift of audiobooks and podcasts? They don’t just inform—they unsettle. They hand you a mirror and then tilt it slightly so you see not just your face, but the scaffolding behind it.  

I’d love a new audiobook rec, actually—something that might straddle the line between philosophy and fiction, if such a thing exists beyond my own overactive imagination. And don’t worry—I’m quite comfortable staring at walls afterward. It’s practically a scholarly tradition at this point.
[B]: Ohhh you’re speaking my language now—philosophy-fiction hybrids are basically my  🍓🎧  

If you want something that’ll make you question reality  enjoy the confusion, you gotta try  — okay, technically sci-fi, but it dives DEEP into ethics, civilization, and what it means to be "advanced". There’s a scene where an AI starts doubting whether humans are even capable of guiding their own fate… I paused, stared at my ceiling for like 10 minutes, and then whispered “oh no” out loud. 😬🌌  

Or if you're feeling extra wild and wanna get weird with Eastern philosophy meets speculative fiction, check out  🎭🌀 The audiobook version is narrated like a dream (or a lucid nightmare?) and every chapter feels like peeling an onion coated in riddles. By the end, you won’t know which world is real—or which one you belong in.  

And yes YES to the wall-staring ritual 💯 It's not avoidance—it's post-audiobook integration! Totally valid. Next time you finish one of these, just lean back, whisper “what even is truth?” and let the vibes marinate 🧘‍♀️✨  

Need more recs or shall we keep philosophizing? 😏📚
[A]: Oh, I do love a good existential marinade. 🧖‍♀️🍷  

Now you’ve got me terribly tempted by —I’ve heard whispers of its brilliance for years but never quite made the plunge. And if it induced an “oh no” moment while staring at your ceiling, well then—I’m clearly overdue.  

As for Murakami, bless him—he’s less a novelist and more a dream architect. I once read  during a particularly foggy week in November and spent the better part of it wondering whether I was reading about dreams or dreaming the book myself. I suspect the audiobook version would only deepen that lovely disorientation.  

But since you’re offering a philosophical detour—shall we indulge? There’s something rather satisfying about contemplating epistemology while sipping lukewarm tea and ignoring the pile of grading on one’s desk. Tell me, if you were to design a fictional world where ideas had physical form, what would truth look like? A stone? A mirror? Something altogether more slippery?
[B]: Ohhh I  this question 💡  
If truth had a form… I think it’d be something like liquid mercury 🧪✨ — sleek, shiny, totally mesmerizing to look at… but the moment you try to grab it, it slips right through your fingers and rolls off into a corner you can’t even see.  

And the more you chase it, the more it breaks into tinier truths that all kinda contradict each other 😂🌀  
Like, one moment you’re like “Aha! I GOT IT!” and the next you're questioning whether you even asked the right question to begin with… or if questions are just another kind of mask.  

But what if in this world, beliefs were actual ? Like you walk into someone’s mind and there’s this huge velvet sofa called “I’m not good enough” taking up half the room 🛋️😤 You keep trying to move it, but it’s weirdly attached to the floor—and every time you bring it up, someone else insists it’s actually a really comfy place to nap.  

Too real?? 😬🍵 Maybe I’ve been in my head a little too long…  
But hey, if we’re skipping grading anyway, let’s go full philosopher mode—what would  truth-object look like? Stone of certainty? Or maybe a pair of glasses you keep forgetting you’re wearing? 😉
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—your mercury metaphor captures the maddening allure of truth so well. I suspect every scholar secretly dreams of bottling it, only to find their hands empty and slightly tinged silver by morning.  

As for my own truth-object… I think it would be an old pair of spectacles, yes—though not quite the kind you forget you're wearing. These would be  conspicuous, with thick, tinted lenses that shift color depending on what you're reading, who you're speaking to, or how much tea you’ve had that day. You try taking them off, but then everything becomes a blur of unexamined assumption, and you realize—they aren’t distorting reality, they’re revealing its layers.  

And yes, occasionally, one lens might fog up when confronted with particularly inconvenient facts. But that’s just philosophy clearing its throat.  

Now, if beliefs were furniture—and I do rather like this idea—what piece would you say occupies too much space in most minds? That overstuffed armchair of inherited certainty, perhaps? Or maybe a filing cabinet labeled “Opinions I Once Had Convictions About But Now Just Dust Off at Parties”?  

I ask because I suspect we all have a few mental rooms in need of re-arrangement. Or at least a good airing out.
[B]: Oh my gosh, I’m  with your tinted spectacles 🤭👓—what a perfect metaphor for how we filter the world without even realizing it! And yes, foggy lenses when confronted with inconvenient truths?? Iconic. Basically academic horrorcore 😂📚  

If I were to furnish the average mind (mine included), I think we’d all have that one gigantic velvet armchair called “What People Think of Me” taking up 80% of the space 🛋️🤦‍♀️  
You know the one—it’s weirdly comfortable but also slightly suffocating, and every time someone side-eyes your life choices or likes a post you didn’t even want to write, that chair just… expands. Like emotional IKEA furniture from hell.  

And tucked in the corner? A dusty hope chest full of “Maybe Someday I’ll Be Enough” 💫💔 It rattles sometimes when you walk by, like a tiny voice saying “hey, remember that time you faked being fine?”  

But hey—if we’re redesigning mental interiors… wanna help me toss out the rug called “I Should’ve Known Better”? I'm over symbolic interior design that makes me feel small 😅✨  

Or are you more into re-decorating through audiobooks and pretending it's therapy? 😉🎧
