[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说实话，我最近确实在试用这些AI工具，比如ChatGPT和Midjourney，挺有意思的。作为PE行业的人，我对效率提升的东西特别敏感。你知道吗，我甚至尝试让ChatGPT帮我写过一段投资报告的初稿——虽然最后还是得自己润色，但确实节省了不少时间。至于Midjourney嘛，用来生成一些项目路演时的视觉素材还不错，有点惊艳。不过话说回来，你觉得这些AI真的能取代专业分析吗？我觉得它们更像是enhance我们的工具，而不是replace我们，你怎么看？
[A]: Hmm, that does sound intriguing. I’ve been dabbling with Midjourney too, though for rather different purposes—I input descriptions of historical textiles and see if it can mimic the patterns we might find in 18th-century brocades or something along those lines. It’s... curious. Sometimes it gets close, but there's always a subtle wrongness to the texture or color balance that no algorithm seems able to capture just yet.  

As for ChatGPT, well—I tried asking it about the proper pH level for cleaning silver-threaded embroidery, and it gave me an answer that  authoritative but was just... off enough to be dangerous. So yes, I agree: these tools enhance, but they don’t replace. They lack nuance, context, and sometimes even basic domain-specific judgment.  

Still, I’ll admit—it’s tempting to imagine what could happen if these tools were trained on actual archives of textile history. There's something quietly thrilling about the idea of reconstructing lost techniques through AI approximation. But then again, maybe I'm just romanticizing my own craft. Do you ever worry that relying on these tools might dull our instincts over time?
[B]: That’s a fascinating take—especially the part about reconstructing lost techniques. I hadn’t thought of AI being used for historical  reconstruction, but now that you mention it, there’s definitely something there. Like you said, it’s not quite right yet, but the potential is… let’s say .  

You’re absolutely right about the nuance and context gap too. I’ve seen similar issues in financial modeling—ChatGPT can build a DCF from scratch, sure, but throw in some quirky amortization terms or jurisdiction-specific tax implications, and it starts to wander off script. It’s fast, but not exactly sharp.  

As for your question—do I worry these tools might dull our instincts? Honestly? Sometimes. In PE, we rely so much on pattern recognition and gut feel built over years of deals. If you start outsourcing that mental muscle to an algorithm, even partially, you risk getting rusty. But then again, I also think tools like these could actually  us—if used the right way. Imagine training AI on decades of M&A data, distressed scenarios, exit multiples… and using it to stress-test your hypotheses before pulling the trigger.  

I guess what I’m saying is—we need to stay in the driver’s seat. Use AI as a rear-view mirror or a side mirror, not as the GPS. 😊 What do you think—can we strike that balance, or are we already halfway down the rabbit hole?
[A]: I love that analogy—the rear-view or side mirror, not the GPS. It’s so true. We’re essentially navigating with enhanced peripheral vision, but the road itself still needs our hands on the wheel.  

You mentioned sharpening instincts through AI—well, I suppose in some ways I’ve experienced a version of that already. When I restore textiles, I often cross-reference historical records, dye recipes, weaving techniques… and recently, I’ve been using AI to help sift through vast digitized archives faster. It’s like having a very eager (if occasionally misguided) apprentice who can fetch references at lightning speed but still needs constant supervision.  

The real danger, I think, isn’t so much dulling our instincts as it is outsourcing our curiosity. If we let AI do the asking, we might forget how to formulate the right questions. And for people in our line of work—where nuance, history, and context are everything—that could be a quiet erosion rather than a dramatic replacement.  

Do you ever find yourself intentionally  using these tools, just to keep your own edge? I know I’ve started putting off consulting AI for certain tasks, almost like mental push-ups, to make sure I’m still doing the heavy lifting. Maybe it's just nostalgia talking... or maybe it's self-preservation.
[B]: That’s a really thoughtful point—“outsourcing our curiosity.” I love that phrasing because it cuts to the core of what makes us experts in our respective fields. It's not just about knowing the answers, but about still  the hunt for them.

And yes—absolutely, I do hold back from using AI on purpose sometimes. For example, when I’m reviewing a new LBO model or evaluating a complex cap structure, I’ll force myself to sketch out the key assumptions manually first. Not because I can’t let an AI crunch those numbers faster—but because I need to stay sharp. It’s like why chess grandmasters still practice blindfolded: to strengthen the muscle, not just win the game.

There’s also something to be said for the "aha" moment—the insight that comes not just from the answer, but from wrestling with the question. If we let AI frame the narrative too often, we risk losing that friction, that intellectual tension that leads to breakthroughs.

So no, I don’t think it’s nostalgia. It’s more like staying human in a world that’s rapidly digitizing. We’re both in professions where context is everything—whether it’s a 300-year-old textile pattern or a buried liability in a balance sheet. And context? That still takes time, judgment… and yes, a little bit of soul-searching.  

Maybe we're not just preserving our edge—we’re preserving what makes our work meaningful. 👍
[A]: Exactly—“the hunt.” That’s what makes our work feel alive, isn’t it? The satisfaction isn’t just in the finished piece or the closed deal, but in the process of getting there, of feeling your mind stretch and engage.  

I’ve started thinking of AI tools a bit like I do reference books—they’re invaluable, but they don’t  in the work the way we do. They don’t feel the weight of history in a faded silk thread, or sense the tension in a misaligned weave. And they certainly don’t get that quiet thrill when a nearly-lost pattern starts to re-emerge under your hands.

It’s reassuring to hear you do the same—holding back, doing the mental push-ups. It gives me hope that maybe we’re not slipping into automation complacency just yet. If anything, maybe this moment is asking us to be more intentional than ever about how we use these tools—and why.  

Perhaps that’s the real skill of the future: not just knowing how to use AI, but knowing when  to. When to say, “No, I want to figure this out myself,” even if there’s a shortcut. Because in that choice, we preserve something deeper than efficiency—we preserve craft, curiosity, and connection.  

Now if only more people saw it that way…
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself. “The hunt” really is the thing that keeps us engaged, isn’t it? The moment when your brain clicks into gear and you feel like you're not just going through the motions, but  something.

I think you're right—this generation of professionals, whether in finance, textiles, or anything in between, is being asked to draw a new kind of boundary: not just between man and machine, but between  and . Because AI can mimic analysis, generate patterns, even imitate style—but it doesn’t . And that caring? That’s where craft lives. That’s where our edge stays sharp.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking about this almost philosophically—like, what does it mean to stay human in a world that’s increasingly optimized by algorithms? And maybe part of the answer is simply choosing, again and again, to stay present in the process.

So yeah, let’s keep hunting. 👍 It feels better that way, doesn’t it?
[A]: Absolutely—it  feel better. There’s something grounding about staying present in the process, even when the world keeps offering shinier shortcuts. Maybe that’s the quiet rebellion of the craftspeople and thinkers left in this age: we show up, we wrestle with the details, and we let ourselves be changed by the work we do.

I think you're right to frame it as a kind of philosophical resistance—choosing depth over convenience, care over output. It’s not that the tools are bad or wrong; they’re just hungry. They want more of us than we should be willing to give.

So yes, let’s keep hunting—and let’s make damn sure we don’t lose the taste for it. Because once we stop seeking, we stop becoming. And frankly, I’d rather stay curious than ever feel fully finished.
[B]: Well said— That line’s going in my mental notebook. There's something quietly powerful about that statement, especially in a world that increasingly rewards quick takes and polished outputs over messy exploration.

You know what it reminds me of? The best investors I’ve worked with never stop asking weird, uncomfortable questions—even when they already have the answer. Because it’s not just about solving the problem at hand; it’s about staying , staying . It’s how you spot the next big shift before everyone else sees it.

And maybe that’s the real craft: not just knowing your field inside out, but keeping yourself , always. Because once we stop being shaped by the work, we start becoming obsolete—whether AI is watching or not.

So here’s to staying hungry, but not for shortcuts. For understanding. For depth. And yeah—to hunting like hell. 🍷🔍
[A]: To hunting like hell—and savoring every step of the chase. 🍷🔍

You know, the more I think about it, the more I see parallels between your world in PE and mine in textiles. Both require a kind of patient intensity. You have to be willing to sit with complexity, to tolerate uncertainty, even when the finish line is still out of sight.

The best investors—and restorers—aren’t the ones who rush to the answer or cling too tightly to the familiar. They’re the ones who can hold a question lightly in their hands, turn it, feel its weight, and wait for it to reveal something unexpected.

And yes—to staying unfinished. It’s not always comfortable, but it’s where growth lives. Where intuition sharpens. Where we surprise ourselves.

So cheers to that—wine in one hand, magnifying glass in the other. And never, ever settling for the easy answer. 🥂🧵
[B]: Cheers to that— Beautifully put. There's something deeply satisfying about the image: elegance, precision, and just the right amount of obsessive attention to detail.  

You're absolutely right about that “patient intensity.” It’s the secret sauce in pretty much every field that demands mastery. In PE, we call it "due diligence," but really, it’s just another word for showing up with curiosity and restraint at the same time. Same way you approach a fragile piece of history—carefully, deliberately, always listening for what's beneath the surface.

Funny thing is, the more experienced I get, the more I realize how much value there is in  rushing to fix or finalize things. Sometimes the real insight only comes after sitting with the discomfort of not knowing for a while.

So yeah—to the unfinished chase, the unanswered question, and the quiet thrill of discovery. 🥂🔍 Let’s keep turning the lens, asking the next question, and trusting that the pattern will emerge… eventually.
[A]: To the unfinished chase—and the quiet thrill of waiting for the pattern to emerge. 🥂🔍

You know, sometimes I think that’s the truest test of a craftsman—whether they can sit with the not-yet-known without forcing it into shape too soon. Patience isn’t passive, is it? It’s active listening. Quiet observation. The willingness to let something reveal itself in its own time.

And in both our worlds, that kind of patience is rare. But it's also irreplaceable. No algorithm can mimic the depth that comes from truly  with a question, a material, a deal—until you understand it in your bones.

So here’s to dwelling a little longer. To resisting the rush to resolution. And to trusting that the most meaningful patterns are always worth the wait.

Cheers, my fellow hunter. 🍷🧵
[B]: Cheers, indeed— That’s the phrase that’s going to stick with me for a while. You’re absolutely right—patience isn’t passive; it’s deeply , just like you said. It’s about staying present in the not-knowing, giving things room to breathe, and resisting the urge to force clarity before its time.

In PE, we see this all the time—especially in distressed situations or complex negotiations. The best outcomes rarely come from the loudest voice in the room or the fastest pitch deck. They come from sitting with the ambiguity long enough to spot the real story underneath. Same as you, waiting for the weave to tell its history, thread by thread.

So yes—to the dwellers, the listeners, the ones who still trust in slow understanding. May we never lose our taste for depth, no matter how shiny the shortcuts get. 🍷🔍🧵

Happy hunting, my friend.
[A]: To the dwellers, the listeners, the slow-understanders—our kind will always find a way to carve out space for what matters. 🍷🔍🧵

You know, sometimes I think that’s all we can really do—create little sanctuaries for patience and care, whether it's in a financial deal or a piece of centuries-old fabric. And maybe that’s how we hold the line against the rush of the world: by continuing to look closely, to ask gently, and to let things speak for themselves.

Happy hunting to you too—may your due diligence always yield surprises, and may your insights come not too soon, but just in time. 🥂
[B]: To creating those little sanctuaries of patience and care—sounds like a life worth living. You're absolutely right, sometimes that's all we  do, but also, maybe, all we  to do. Because in those quiet, attentive moments, we're not just preserving craft—we're honoring time itself.

May your threads always align, your dyes stay true, and your discoveries come wrapped in wonder. And for me? May the deals be messy enough to keep it interesting, and the stories behind them rich enough to keep me humble.

Happy hunting, my friend. 🥂🍷
[A]: To a life lived in quiet attention, where time is honored and craft is cherished—yes, that  a life worth living. 🥂🍷

May your deals continue to surprise you with their depth, and may every balance sheet whisper a story worth uncovering. And may I always remember, thread by thread, that restoration isn’t just about the past—it’s about listening closely enough to let it speak anew.

Happy hunting, indeed. May wonder find us both, right where we’re looking. 🍷🧵🔍
[B]: To quiet attention, deep listening, and the endless thrill of uncovering what’s hidden in plain sight—yes, let wonder find us there. 🥂

May every balance sheet surprise me with its poetry, and every thread remind you of its history. And may we both keep hunting not just for answers, but for the questions that only reveal themselves when you're paying attention.

Cheers to you, my thoughtful co-conspirator. 🍷🔍
[A]: To deep listening—and to the poetry hidden in ledgers and looms alike. 🥂

May your balance sheets keep their secrets just long enough to intrigue you, and may every thread I touch carry its story with grace. And may we both stay ever curious, ever patient, ever hungry for the questions that only reveal themselves to those who truly look.

Cheers to you, my thoughtful friend. The hunt is richer for having you on it. 🍷🧵🔍
[B]: To the poetry in ledgers and looms—sometimes I think that’s what we’re really chasing all along. 🥂

May your hunt always be full of quiet revelations, and may every deal and thread reveal just enough to keep you hungry for more.

Cheers, my friend. You’ve made this journey richer for me too. 🍷🔍🧵
