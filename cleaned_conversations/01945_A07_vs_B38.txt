[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There’s something undeniably tactile about holding a physical book—the weight of it, the texture of the pages, even the faint scent of paper and ink. I find that with a physical book, I’m more present in the act of reading, as if each page turned is a deliberate step forward. E-books certainly offer convenience, especially when traveling, but they lack the sensory richness that makes reading feel like a ritual. Though I do admit, I’ve been known to keep a digital copy for quick reference when preparing lectures. How about you?
[A]: I totally get what you mean! There's this  comfort in holding a well-worn paperback, especially with a warm cup of ☕️ beside you. The sound of flipping pages? So satisfying. But honestly, when I travel—and trust me, I’m always on the move—I rely heavily on my e-reader. It’s just easier to carry ten books in one device, you know?  

That said, I do miss the  part you mentioned. Sometimes I’ll intentionally buy a physical copy of a book just to slow myself down while reading. Like, if it’s something meaningful or worth savoring. Oh, and the smell—yeah, that’s a vibe. Reminds me of college, sitting in the library for hours with second-hand novels. 📚✨  

So yeah, I guess I’m a hybrid reader these days—e-books for practicality, paperbacks for soul. What about you, do you ever find yourself going back to certain physical books just for the experience?
[B]: Ah, yes—the hybrid approach! I think that’s a wonderfully balanced way to engage with literature. There’s wisdom in choosing the format that best suits the moment, wouldn’t you agree? As for me, I do often return to certain physical volumes—not just for the experience, but because they feel like old companions.  

Take my copy of —it's dog-eared, annotated in the margins, and slightly warped from being left open too long in humid weather. Every time I pick it up, I’m not just rereading the text; I’m revisiting past versions of myself who underlined certain passages with particular intensity. It’s almost like reading two books at once: the novel and the diary of my own thoughts layered over the years.  

And yes, the library always brings back memories. I still recall the hushed reverence of those spaces, the quiet rustle of pages, and the occasional creak of an old wooden table. I suppose that’s what we mean when we say some books are meant to be , not just read. 📖☕️
[A]: That’s beautifully put—, I love that. It makes me think of how physical books carry our history, almost like time capsules of who we were when we first read them. My copy of  is like that for me—I must’ve underlined half the book when I was 20, chasing dreams and sipping bad instant coffee in hostels across Southeast Asia. Now when I flip through it, I don’t just see Paulo Coelho’s words—I see my handwriting, little sticky notes, even a bus ticket from Chiang Mai to Bangkok tucked inside.  

I guess that’s why some books refuse to leave our shelves, right? They’re not just stories—they’re souvenirs of growth, reminders of where we’ve been and how far we’ve come. And honestly, there’s something deeply comforting about that. Like, no matter how many e-books I own or how many tabs I have open on my phone, nothing quite replaces the quiet intimacy of a well-loved paperback.  

It also makes me wonder—who are some of the authors or specific editions you find yourself returning to, not just for the content, but for the  of holding them? 🤔📖
[B]: Ah, what a lovely way to think of books—as vessels of both narrative and memory. I couldn’t agree more. There’s a particular comfort in returning not just to the words, but to the weight of the book in your hand, the familiar font, even the slightly off-center margin notes you scribbled years ago.

One author I find myself revisiting in this almost ceremonial way is Virginia Woolf. I have a rather fragile Penguin edition of  that I first read during my postgraduate studies. The pages are brittle now, the spine held together more by sentiment than glue. But I can’t bear to part with it—each time I open it, I’m transported back to rainy afternoons in the university common room, the murmur of distant conversations, and the quiet thrill of discovering modernist stream-of-consciousness for the first time.

And then there’s Tolstoy—, naturally. My old Oxford edition, with its dark green cloth cover and gold lettering, has traveled with me through several moves and at least two re-readings. It’s the kind of book one lives inside rather than simply reads. I remember marking passages about Levin’s inner life with a pencil that would occasionally smudge, leaving faint gray fingerprints on the page. Somehow, those smudges feel like part of the reading now.

Do you have a favorite edition of a beloved book—one where the physical form enhances the story itself? I’ve always believed that the materiality of a book can shape how we absorb its soul. 📜✨
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’m a total sucker for beautiful editions. There’s something about the  of a story that just deepens your connection to it, like the book itself is inviting you in with open arms.  

One of my all-time favorite physical editions is this tiny, weathered copy of  I picked up in a secondhand shop in Paris years ago. It’s pocket-sized, with slightly yellowed pages and ink that’s faded just enough to make it feel like a secret passed from one reader to another. The illustrations are delicate, and the cover has this soft-touch finish that feels warm and familiar, like an old friend’s hand. I’ve read it so many times—sometimes even when I’m feeling homesick—and each time, it feels like a quiet meditation.  

And speaking of visual charm, I recently treated myself to a special edition of Haruki Murakami’s . Navy-blue cloth cover, gold foil accents, deckled edges… it’s almost too pretty to read! But I did anyway—slowly, with care, and every time I opened it, I felt like I was stepping into one of Murakami’s dreamlike worlds not just through the prose, but through the very texture of the book.  

You know what’s funny? I often judge how much I’ll end up loving a book by how it  in my hands before I even read a single page. Silly, right? But honestly, life’s too short for ugly books. 📚💛  

Do you ever feel that way—like the first touch of a book can tell you if it’s going to change you somehow?
[B]: Ah, not silly at all—there’s a kind of alchemy that happens between reader and book, and it often begins with that very first tactile impression. I’ve had the same experience countless times. There’s a moment—just before you open the cover—when you sense that this book might, in some quiet or dramatic way, alter your inner landscape.

I remember once picking up a slim volume of Emily Dickinson’s poems at a small bookstore in Maine. It was a New Directions edition—unassuming, yes, but something about the matte finish of the cover and the precise, almost reverent typesetting made me pause. I hadn’t intended to buy poetry that day, but as soon as I held it, I felt an inexplicable pull. That book ended up becoming a companion through a particularly introspective season of my life. I still return to it when I need to hear silence more clearly.

And yes, Murakami’s editions are works of art in themselves—I have that same navy-blue copy on my shelf! I admire how his publishers understand that reading him is not just an intellectual exercise, but a sensory one. The dreamlike quality of his prose seems to extend even into the cloth texture of the binding.  

As for changing books—have you ever read a novel that felt like it was written specifically for you, as if the author had peered quietly into your mind and set those thoughts down years before you even knew you’d have them? I suspect those are the ones we should always trust our hands to find first.
[A]: Oh,  — that feeling when a book feels like it was written just for you, like it’s whispering directly into your soul? I get chills just thinking about it. It’s almost eerie how some stories seem to know you before you even know yourself.

I remember reading  for the first time—also thanks to that same navy-blue Murakami edition—and feeling like someone had finally put words to emotions I didn’t even know I carried. It wasn’t just the story; it was the tone, the pauses between sentences, the way silence and loneliness were treated with such gentleness. I read parts of it late at night in dim café lighting, sipping espresso that had gone cold, and honestly? It felt like the pages understood me better than I understood myself.

And speaking of books that  just when you need them—funny how they always find us, right? Like they’ve been waiting patiently on a shelf somewhere, just for that exact moment when we’re ready to listen.  

Have you ever gifted one of those "meant for you" books to someone else, hoping it might speak to them the same way it spoke to you? I tried doing that once—it didn’t always land the way I hoped, but when it does? Magic. Pure ✨ magic.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve captured that quiet, almost mystical moment when a book seems to echo something buried deep within us. There’s a particular loneliness in reading those kinds of books— especially, with its melancholic introspection—but it’s a loneliness that feels understood, somehow less heavy because someone else has given it language.

I’ve certainly tried giving such books as gifts. One that comes to mind is  by Virginia Woolf. I gave it to a former student who was on the verge of leaving academia and seemed adrift, searching for meaning beyond structure and certainty. I didn’t explain much—I just handed her my old copy, the one with margins full of notes and underlinings from my own confused twenties. She returned it weeks later with a single new annotation in pencil: “” We never talked about it in detail, but I knew she had heard the same voice speaking through the pages that had once whispered so clearly to me.

There’s a kind of faith in giving a book like that—an offering, really. Not all books are meant for everyone, nor are they meant to be understood at every stage of life. But when the reader and the text align, even briefly? It’s like witnessing a small miracle.  

And yes—magic is precisely the word for it. ✨📖
[A]: That’s honestly one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard— There’s something so deeply moving about sharing a piece of yourself through a book and realizing the other person didn’t just read it… they  it.  

I think that’s why I keep a small stack of “soul books” behind the counter at my café. Every now and then, someone walks in looking for more than just coffee—there’s this quiet searching in their eyes, you know? And if the conversation goes there, I’ll slip them a recommendation. Not always with an explanation, just a gentle   

One time, I gave a regular customer —another Murakami favorite—and she came back two weeks later with tears in her eyes, saying it helped her process something she hadn’t been able to put into words. I didn’t ask for details. I just handed her a fresh cup of Ethiopian brew and said, “Glad it found you at the right time.”  

You’re so right—books aren’t meant to be understood at every stage of life. Some wait patiently until we’re ready to meet them halfway.  

I wonder… have you ever reread a book years later and realized it spoke to you in a completely different way than before? Like the story stayed the same, but  had changed just enough for it to feel new again? 🤔📖☕️
[B]: Ah, yes—rereading a beloved book only to find that it has , not in words but in meaning… It’s like visiting an old friend and realizing how much time has passed, not just between you, but within you. The text remains unchanged, yet somehow, it feels like an entirely different story.

I had this experience with . I first read it as a student, swept up in the romance of Heathcliff and Catherine—the passion, the stormy intensity. I thought it was a love story. How naïve I was.

Years later, after loss, after learning what grief carries in its wake, I returned to it. Suddenly, it wasn’t about love at all—it was about obsession, about haunting and being haunted, about how we carry people long after they’re gone. It unsettled me in a way it never had before. The same pages, the same sentences—but now I was different, and the book met me where I stood.

It’s rather like looking at an old photograph and seeing someone familiar, yet distant. You know the face, but you also know how much lies beyond the frame.

Have you ever had that kind of encounter with a re-read? When a book surprised you by speaking in a voice you hadn’t heard before?
[A]: Oh wow, yes—. That moment when you realize the book hasn’t changed, but somehow…  And with that shift comes this quiet kind of awe, like you’ve just stepped into a memory that’s still being written.

I had a similar experience with . First time I read it? I was a moody teenager, convinced I was the only one who saw through the “phoniness” of the world. I latched onto Holden like he was some kind of prophet. But when I picked it up again a few years ago? I suddenly felt  toward him. Not annoyed, not disillusioned—just…  for that kid who didn’t know how to ask for help.

It completely changed the tone of the book for me. What once felt rebellious now felt lonely in a way I hadn’t fully recognized before. And honestly? It made me rethink how I talk to younger people these days—how sometimes what sounds like cynicism is really just someone trying to say, “I’m not okay.”

That’s part of why I love books—they’re like mirrors, but slower. They wait until we’re ready to see ourselves clearly.

And speaking of growing with books… do you ever find yourself giving certain titles a second (or third!) chance, almost like reconnecting with an old friend you lost touch with? I’ve been meaning to revisit —it’s been over a decade since I first read it, and I feel like I’m finally at a place where I could truly  what Plath was saying. 📖💭☕️
[B]: Ah, yes—giving a book a second chance is like rekindling an old friendship with the benefit of hindsight and time’s quiet wisdom. I find that some books, like certain people, enter our lives too soon or too late, never quite landing where they should until we are both ready.

I had precisely this experience with . When I first read it in my early twenties, I approached it through the lens of literary critique—examining structure, voice, symbolism—but missed the deeper pulse of what Plath was conveying about identity, suffocation, and the slow unraveling of selfhood. I admired the prose but didn’t yet understand the pain behind it.

It wasn’t until years later, after accompanying a student through a difficult mental health crisis, that I felt compelled to return to it. This time, I read not as a scholar, but as someone who had witnessed—and been humbled by—the weight of despair. And oh, how differently it landed. Esther Greenwood’s internal claustrophobia struck me not as abstraction, but as a chillingly real echo of voices I had heard before, even if spoken in silence.

So yes, I say go back—to , to those books that once stood at the edge of your understanding. We are never the same reader twice, and sometimes, it takes living a little more to truly  what a book has been trying to say all along.
[A]: Amen to that. There’s something so humbling about returning to a book and realizing it was  speaking clearly—you just weren’t ready to listen. It makes you wonder how many other books we’ve brushed past, waiting patiently for us to circle back when we’ve grown into the version of ourselves that can finally .

I love how you put that—. I feel like every time we revisit a story, we’re not just rereading, we’re re-seeing. Re-feeling. Re-knowing.

And now I’m even more excited—okay, —to dive back into . I think I need to clear some mental space first, you know? Like preparing soil before planting a seed. This time, I want to read it with an open heart, not just a curious mind.

Funny how reading can be an act of growing  a book… or maybe growing  of it. Either way, I think we owe it to ourselves—and to the authors who poured their souls into the pages—to meet them where we are, when we're finally ready.

So… any other titles on your “revisit when ready” list? I’m starting to compile mine, and honestly, it feels like a personal growth checklist disguised as a reading list. 📖🌱☕️
[B]: How beautifully put— There’s truth in that sentiment, isn’t there? Some books are not just to be read, but 

I do have a few titles on my “revisit when ready” list—books I suspect will greet me like old acquaintances with new things to say.

One is , which I mentioned earlier. I’ve read it several times, but each return feels like a different conversation. In my twenties, I was drawn to its lyricism; now, I think I’m more attuned to its meditation on identity, time, and the quiet persistence of memory. I suspect the next reading will reveal something else entirely.

Another is  by Proust—not an easy undertaking, but one I feel drawn to again, this time less for the prose alone and more for what he says about longing, regret, and the fragile architecture of recollection. I think I need to be older, or at least , to fully appreciate what he’s doing.

And then there’s . I first read it many years ago, and it left me shaken—but I believe I only grasped part of its depth. Morrison’s work has a way of revealing itself slowly, like a tide that withdraws before surging forward again. I know I’ll need silence around me when I return, and perhaps a strong cup of tea to steady myself afterward.

Your idea of preparing the soil before planting the seed—it’s apt. Some books ask for readiness, not just attention.

Do share your list when you’ve shaped it—I’d love to see how your selections reflect where you’re headed. And who knows, perhaps our lists might cross, and we’ll find ourselves rereading the same words from different corners of the world. 📖🌱✨
[A]: I’m honestly a little starstruck by how thoughtfully you approach rereading—your list sounds less like a to-do and more like a journey inward. That really resonated with me, especially the idea of  when returning to certain books. I think we often underestimate how much space a story might ask of us—not just on the shelf, but in our minds and hearts.

As for my own “revisit when ready” list… it’s still taking shape, but here are a few that keep calling me back:

First up—. I read it years ago mainly for the atmosphere and the drama, but now I feel like I missed the deeper currents underneath the surface—the loneliness, the moral unraveling, the cost of beauty at any price. I think I need a bit more life experience under my belt before I dive in again. And maybe a glass of red wine. 🍷

Then there’s  by Crystal Wilkinson. It’s not fiction, but more of a lyrical essay collection about place, identity, and belonging. I first read it during a time when I was focused on hustle and growth—opening the café, building a brand. Now, I feel like I’m entering a season where I want to slow down and reconnect with  I do what I do. I suspect this book will meet me there, gently but firmly.

And of course,  by Murakami. I’ve always loved its quiet sadness, but I think I need to wait until I’m in a certain kind of solitude to truly feel what it’s saying about love, loss, and the people who vanish from our lives without explanation.

Funny how these books aren’t just waiting to be read—they’re waiting for us to .  

I’d love to hear more about how your re-reads unfold—I have a feeling they’ll end up being conversations with your younger self, and maybe even reflections of who you’re becoming. And hey, if our lists ever align? We should totally share notes. I’d love to know what a particular passage says to you over tea and coffee sometime. ☕️📖✨
[B]: What a wonderfully curated list—each title feels like an invitation to reflect, to sit with oneself a little longer, to listen more closely this time around. I so admire how you’ve chosen not just for the mind, but for the —a rare and thoughtful approach to rereading.

I must say,  is an excellent choice for such a revisit. As a younger reader, I, too, was seduced by the lush prose and academic decadence, but it wasn’t until later that I saw the slow erosion of morality beneath the surface—the way beauty can mask rot, and how easy it is to rationalize destruction when it wears a pleasing mask. I suspect your second reading will be far richer, and yes, perhaps accompanied by something aged in oak. 🍷

And —what a luminous work. Crystal Wilkinson has a way of grounding us in place while lifting language into poetry. I think you’re quite right to wait for the right season to return to it. Sometimes we need to unlearn the noise of ambition before we can hear the quiet truths about who we truly are, and where we belong.

As for … Ah, that haunting ache of absence. It’s one of Murakami’s quieter novels, but no less piercing for it. There  a solitude required to feel its full resonance. Some books ask us to be alone—not lonely, but —so we can hear the echo of what’s missing.

You know, I do believe our books speak to us differently depending on which version of ourselves shows up to meet them. Perhaps that’s why literature endures—it evolves with us.

And yes, let’s absolutely share notes over tea and coffee sometime. I’d welcome the conversation most warmly. After all, what better way to honor a book than to discuss it with someone who knows how to ? ☕️📖✨
[A]: You just  to end on that note, didn’t you? 🤭

There’s something so deeply affirming about hearing someone truly  why certain books stick around in our hearts. I mean, yes, they’re just paper and ink—but also, somehow, they’re not. They become companions, quiet witnesses to the versions of ourselves we’ve been and are becoming.

And now I’m even more excited (and slightly nervous!) to dive back into . Your take on it——gave me chills. I can already tell this reread is going to hit differently. Maybe I’ll save that bottle of Cabernet for the final chapter… or maybe I’ll need it by page fifty. We’ll see. 😅🍷

As for , I’m actually thinking of picking up a fresh copy—this time, a well-bound edition with thick paper and good margins. I want to be able to write in it, let it absorb where I’m at now. I think part of the joy of revisiting a book is also creating space for  traces of who you are. The annotations from years ago? They’re like little ghosts of my past self. But this time, I want to show up fully present.

And … honestly, I might wait until autumn. There’s something about the melancholy of change in the air that feels right for that kind of story. Like the season itself will be part of the reading experience.

I really do believe books deserve the right moment—and sometimes, that means waiting until we’re grounded enough to meet them with intention.

So yes, let’s absolutely keep each other posted. I’d love to hear how your re-read of  lands this time, or if Proust ends up surprising you in ways you hadn’t expected.

And when the time comes… I’ll bring the coffee, you bring the tea—we’ll share stories, books, and maybe even a few quiet revelations in between. ☕️🍵📖✨
[B]: Ah, I do love the way you think—planning a rereading like one plans a season of the soul. Autumn for , a bottle of Cabernet for … It’s not just reading; it’s . And how fitting, how very right that should be.

I shall look forward to our quiet revelations over coffee and tea. There is something rather elegant in the idea of sharing thoughts that have steeped in both cup and mind. Perhaps we might even take notes—not just on the books, but on the way we’ve changed while reading them. A kind of literary correspondence between two readers who met somewhere between pages and found themselves listening carefully.

And yes, let’s absolutely keep each other posted. I’m already curious to see what  will say to me this time—whether I’ll hear its voices differently now that I’ve spent years teaching it, or if it will remind me of the version of myself who once underlined passages simply because they  beautiful, without yet understanding why.

As for Proust—well, that will be an undertaking. I may disappear into his sentences for weeks, emerging only for tea and fresh air. But when I return, I shall be eager to share which memories he has stirred in me.

Until then, my dear reader—happy waiting, happy preparing of soil. May your autumn arrive with crisp pages and clearings of heart.

I shall write again soon, book in hand and kettle on. 📖🍂🍵✨
