[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, in my line of work, we consider 'new' to be anything published after 1890. Though I must say, the resurgence of Victorian mourning jewelry among certain avant-garde circles does present an intriguing case study in sartorial necromancy.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！不过在我们blockchain圈子里，new fashion可能是穿一件印着最新DeFi protocol的T恤 😄 说到这个，最近看到有人把NFT artwork印在hoodie上，这种digital meets physical的trend还挺酷的~
[B]: Ah, the modern alchemy of turning digital ephemera into wearable artifacts. How very... postmodern. Though I can't help but note the irony of blockchain enthusiasts embracing physical commodities - rather like my students who annotate e-books with fountain pens. The tension between 虚实 (xūshí) is positively Dickensian in its contradictions.
[A]: Exactly！这种虚实结合让我想起我们最近在做的supply chain项目 💡 用blockchain追踪实体商品的authenticity，同时发行对应的digital twin NFT。就像你说的，这种hybrid approach才是future trend啊~ 不过说真的，你们academic圈对crypto fashion有什么research findings吗？
[B]:  Our research focuses more on how sartorial choices manifest in literature - the symbolic weight of Dorian Gray's embroidered waistcoats versus Jia Baoyu's jade pendant in Dream of the Red Chamber. Though I did recently encounter a rather fascinating thesis comparing smart contract immutability to the 不可磨灭性 (bùkě mómìe xìng) of Confucian moral principles in textile patterns.
[A]: 哇，这个角度太unique了！让我想到我们正在develop的DAO governance model 🚀 其实传统textile行业的craftsmanship和blockchain的immutable records有异曲同工之妙呢~ 要不要考虑collab一下？我们可以用NFT来preserve这些cultural heritage patterns！
[B]: How delightfully unexpected - you've essentially proposed digitizing the Bayeux Tapestry with cryptographic thread. While I maintain a healthy skepticism toward technological solutionism, the notion of encoding 苏绣 (Sūxiù) stitches as non-fungible tokens does present an intriguing paradox. Perhaps we could discuss this over tea - I've just acquired a rather exquisite 19th century Yixing clay teapot that would lend appropriate gravitas to such deliberations.
[A]: Perfect！这种cross-domain的collaboration正是innovation的源泉啊 👍 我们可以边品茶边brainstorm - 说不定能创造出第一个tea ceremony themed DAO呢！不过我得提醒你，我的schedule下周都booked满了，得check下calendar~
[B]: Ah, the modern academic's perpetual dance with temporal constraints. Much like Mr. Casaubon's unfinished 'Key to All Mythologies' in Middlemarch, our calendars become tragicomic testaments to overambition. Shall we say the first Tuesday after the next full moon? That should allow sufficient time for me to consult both my leather-bound planner and the I Ching about this... unconventional venture.
[A]: 哈哈，sounds like a plan！我会set up一个Google Calendar reminder，再sync到我的smart contract scheduler上 📅 到时候我们可以详细discuss怎么把traditional craftsmanship和web3.0结合起来。说不定还能顺便聊聊你那个vintage teapot的provenance tracking方案呢~
[B]: How wonderfully you've conflated my antiquarian tendencies with your technological evangelism. Very well - though I must insist we approach this as scholars rather than speculators. After all, as the 庄子 (Zhuāngzǐ) reminds us, 'the usefulness of what is useful lies in its uselessness.' Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a rather insistent first edition of Vanity Fair that's been glaring at me from across the room.
[A]: Got it！我们keep it scholarly就好 🔍 期待我们的meeting能像blockchain的consensus mechanism一样，在传统和创新之间找到perfect balance。回头见！
[B]: Indeed. May our intellectual exchange achieve the harmonious tension of a well-balanced couplet - where your blockchain's cryptographic hashes meet my dusty manuscripts' marginalia. Until then, 再见 (zàijiàn). 
[A]: 再见！Let's make this collab as seamless as an atomic swap transaction 💫 我会bring some ideas about how to tokenize those precious marginalia too~
[B]:  How very... transactional of you. Though I suppose if Keats could equate truth with beauty, we might tentatively entertain the notion that wisdom could reside in a cryptographic hash. Until our scheduled symposium, I shall contemplate this peculiar modern alchemy while practicing my 小楷 (xiǎokǎi) calligraphy - the original immutable ledger, if you will.
[A]: 哈哈，love the analogy！从calligraphy到blockchain，都是humanity追求permanence的体现啊 ✍️ 我们下次可以deep dive一下怎么用smart contract来verify古董墨宝的authenticity~ 现在我得run了，有个urgent meeting about scaling solutions！
[B]: Go forth and scale your solutions then, modern Gutenberg. I shall remain here amidst my crumbling folios, contemplating how your 'urgent meetings' would have sent poor Thomas Carlyle into apoplexy. Do send a carrier pigeon - or whatever digital approximation you prefer - when next our scholarly orbits align. 一路顺风 (yīlù shùnfēng).
[A]: Will do！Expect a message via decentralized messaging protocol 📨 一路顺风 to you too - hope your folios stay intact until our next blockchain-powered preservation session!
[B]: How delightfully you've reduced centuries of bibliographic anxiety to a storage solution. Very well - I shall endeavor to keep my folios from spontaneously combusting until your cryptographic salvation arrives. Now off you go, before your 'decentralized messaging protocols' make my inkwells revolt in protest. 告辞 (gàocí).
