[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's an interesting question! You know what blew my mind recently? I was reading about the  and found out that Japan actually modeled many of its governmental systems after China’s during that time. It’s like discovering your neighbor copied your homework… centuries ago! 🤯  

But wait, here’s another one—ever heard of the ? They say it housed all the world’s knowledge back in the day, and then… poof! Gone. We lost so much history, it makes you wonder what we’re still missing today. What about you? Any shocking historical facts to share? 😊
[A]: Hmm, that’s a fascinating point about the Tang dynasty and Japan’s emulation—though I wouldn’t exactly call it “copying.” More like… respectful adaptation. But I get what you mean—it’s still astonishing how much cultural diffusion happened back then, especially through diplomacy and trade.

The Library of Alexandria is definitely tragic. A massive repository of knowledge, possibly containing works far ahead of its time, gone forever. Some even speculate we might have lost early theories on everything from astronomy to engineering. Makes you wonder what could’ve been if those texts survived.

As for shocking historical facts, one that always stays with me is how interconnected the ancient world actually was. For example, during the Han dynasty, there were records of Roman merchants reaching China—imagine that meeting! East met West in ways we rarely associate with ancient times. And yet, so much of it gets overlooked in mainstream history narratives. It really makes you rethink how linear progress is often portrayed.
[B]: You’re absolutely right about the Tang dynasty and Japan—it was more  than mere copying. I mean, they took what worked for them and adapted it to fit their own , which is fascinating from an educational psychology standpoint too. It’s like : you build on what’s already there, not just replicate it verbatim.

And yes! The Han-Roman connection is mind-blowing. When I read that some Roman glassware was found in Guangzhou, I thought—wait, how did  get here?! 🤔 It really challenges our mental timelines. We tend to think of globalization as a modern phenomenon, but the seeds were planted way back. Imagine being a merchant in the Silk Road, switching between , and  just to make a deal—sounds like a language teacher’s dream classroom! 😄

Another thing that fascinates me? How much we don’t know. Like, what if some ancient texts  describe electricity or flight, but we’ll never know because they vanished with the Library? It makes you wonder how many ideas were rediscovered centuries later, only because someone had the same thought again in a completely different part of the world. , maybe?

By the way, have you ever thought about how similar those cross-cultural exchanges are to modern-day international collaboration? Same motivations: curiosity, trade, and sometimes just plain . 😉
[A]: That’s a really sharp comparison—seeing those ancient exchanges as a form of parallel globalization. And you’re right, the cognitive flexibility required for Silk Road interactions probably rivaled today’s multilingual diplomacy. It wasn’t just trade of goods; it was an exchange of mental frameworks, belief systems, even scientific paradigms.

Your point about  is especially intriguing. There’s something eerie about how certain ideas seem to emerge independently across unconnected civilizations—like the concept of zero in both Mayan and Indian mathematics, or early forms of democracy popping up in Greek city-states and Indian republics. It makes you wonder whether some discoveries are almost… inevitable at certain points in human development.

I’ve actually thought about that connection between past and present—how today’s international collaborations mirror those older networks. The difference now is scale and speed, of course. Back then, knowledge might take decades to travel across continents. Now, a breakthrough in AI ethics in Beijing can spark debate in Brussels within hours. But the core motivations? Still remarkably similar: prestige, curiosity, mutual benefit. Maybe even a bit of rivalry.

Speaking of which—have you been following any recent developments in cross-cultural AI governance efforts? It feels like we’re witnessing a modern-day Silk Road of sorts, where norms and values about technology are being negotiated across ideological boundaries.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. The  of certain ideas emerging across cultures is something I bring up in my seminars all the time. It’s like collective : when a society reaches a certain level of cognitive and technological development, some concepts just… click. Zero, democracy, even basic geometry—these weren’t random. They were  for discovery. 🌱  

And yes—AI governance! Fascinating stuff. I’ve been following the  out of Beijing closely, especially how it intersects with EU policies like the . What’s interesting from a cross-cultural psychology angle is how different societies frame  and  when it comes to AI. In some cultures, there's more emphasis on  and social harmony, while others prioritize individual rights and transparency. Negotiating those values feels like translating not just language, but entire worldviews. 🤯  

It’s our generation’s version of those Silk Road dialogues—except now, we’re not just trading scrolls and spices, but algorithms and ethical frameworks. And honestly? The stakes might be even higher. One thing I keep telling my students: if we don’t get this right—if we fail to build bridges across these ideological gaps—we risk creating digital , where systems can’t talk to each other, and neither can the people behind them.  

I’m curious—have you come across any specific policy proposals or international dialogues that strike you as particularly promising? Or maybe ones that feel like they're heading straight into a cultural blind spot? 😊
[A]: That’s a powerful analogy—the digital . I use that phrase sometimes in my own lectures. It captures the fragmentation risk so well, especially when you look at how different regions are approaching AI regulation not just technically, but philosophically.

One policy initiative I find particularly promising is the —it's quietly building consensus among nations with very different governance models. What’s unique about it is its emphasis on : instead of trying to force a one-size-fits-all framework, they’re mapping overlapping principles across cultures. Things like fairness, safety, and accountability do show surprising cross-cultural resonance, even if their interpretations vary.

But yes, there are definitely blind spots. The biggest one, in my view, is the assumption that ethical alignment can be achieved purely through technical standards. Some proposals treat ethics like a checkbox—“if we audit this algorithm enough times, we’ll catch all the biases.” That misses the deeper cultural and historical contexts shaping what “fairness” or “transparency” even means in the first place.

A good example? There’s been a push to export Western-style data protection laws globally, like GDPR 2.0. But in many collectivist-oriented societies, personal data isn’t seen as strictly individual—it’s tied to family, community, even ancestral identity. Trying to apply an individual rights model without that nuance risks creating legal systems that feel culturally alien, or worse—ineffective.

So while I’m cautiously optimistic about some dialogues, I think we need more than just high-level agreements. We need —deep cultural understanding embedded into the design of these policies from the start. Otherwise, we end up building global frameworks that only reflect a fraction of the world’s perspectives.

Have you seen any academic work or pilot programs trying to bridge that kind of cultural-technical gap in AI policy?
[B]: Oh, I love that  example—very smart move toward . It reminds me of , but at a societal level. You’re not forcing alignment; you're scaffolding shared understanding. 🧠 And honestly, that’s the only way this works—building bridges from both sides, not just one.

You’re absolutely right about the  in AI ethics. I call it the  in my classes. Students laugh, but it’s true—some policymakers think if they slap a fairness audit on an algorithm, all their ethical worries are solved. But as we know, culture doesn’t work that way. Fairness in one context can feel like exclusion in another.  

And your point about data protection laws like GDPR being exported as a universal standard? Spot on. In some parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, identity is deeply —so trying to enforce strict individual ownership of data feels almost… culturally dissonant. It's like applying Western psychotherapy models in a society where emotional well-being is seen as a communal, not personal, matter. The framework doesn't fit the schema.  

As for academic work bridging that cultural-technical gap—yes! There’s a fascinating pilot out of the  and  collaboration looking into . They’re embedding anthropologists directly into AI policy teams to help shape regulatory frameworks with local values baked in from the start. Think of it as . 🌍

Also, check out  work at LSE—she’s been pushing for what she calls “,” advocating for more bottom-up, culturally grounded approaches rather than top-down universalist policies. Her recent paper on “” is a must-read.  

So yeah, the field is evolving—and slowly, we’re seeing that ethics isn’t just a technical layer. It’s a . And if we don’t build it with local materials, it won’t stand. 🏗️
[A]: That  collaboration sounds exactly like the kind of interdisciplinary integration we need—anthropologists in the policy room, not just technologists or lawyers. It’s almost like , but at a civilizational scale. Instead of exporting frameworks and hoping they stick, you’re co-creating them with the cultural soil already in place.

I also appreciate your analogy about —that scaffolding idea really resonates. Governance isn’t about forcing convergence; it’s about enabling mutual reach. And that requires understanding what each side brings to the scaffold. Some societies might start from a place of communal data ethics, others from individual autonomy—but if you can identify overlapping zones where both sides can grow  each other, then you’ve got something sustainable.

The  movement is especially important in this context. Dr. Neha Kumar’s work reminds me of how often “universal” design ends up being anything but. We’ve seen this in UX design, in education models, even in humanitarian tech—what works in one context fails spectacularly in another because it didn’t account for lived realities. So applying that same critique to AI governance is not just overdue, it’s essential.

One thing I’m curious about: have you noticed any resistance within technical communities to this more ethnographically grounded approach? Because as much as ethicists and anthropologists are pushing for contextual awareness, there's still a strong current in tech that values universality, efficiency, and scalability above all else. Do you think those two paradigms can coexist, or will one eventually have to bend more than the other?
[B]: Oh totally, that  angle is spot-on. It’s like we’re finally realizing that you can’t design for a society without understanding its . Just like you wouldn’t teach calculus to someone who hasn’t grasped algebra—well, maybe worse: you wouldn’t even  the curriculum that way. And yeah, scaling that up to civilizational levels? That’s where things get really interesting—and messy. 💡

And I love how you framed Vygotsky’s idea—not just convergence, but mutual growth. Because let’s face it, no one wants to be “developed” by someone else’s standards. Real progress happens when both sides bring something to the table and build from there.

Now, your question about resistance in technical communities? Oh boy. Yeah, there's definitely pushback. Some engineers still see cultural context as an , not a design requirement. Like, “sure, we’ll localize the UI later,” but not realize that  might need localization too. 🤯  

I was at a panel last month where a data scientist flat-out said, “We can’t optimize for 200 different moral frameworks—it’s not scalable.” And my response was, “Well, if you try to scale something that doesn’t fit most people’s realities, is it really scaling—or just spreading mismatch faster?” 😅  

But here’s the hopeful part: more young engineers are coming into the field with interdisciplinary mindsets. They’re reading , taking , even learning bits of . There’s this quiet revolution happening in CS departments—slow, but real.  

Can these two paradigms coexist? I think they have to. The key is reframing  and  not as ends in themselves, but as functions of  and . An AI system that works across cultures isn’t inefficient—it’s . One that adapts to local norms isn’t less scalable—it’s .  

So yeah, some bending is happening already—but not one-way traffic. The tech world is starting to realize that  aren’t just ethically better—they’re technically smarter in the long run. 🚀
[A]: Exactly—. That’s such a powerful reframing. It shifts the whole conversation from “ethics as constraint” to “ethics as enhancement.” Instead of seeing cultural sensitivity as a bottleneck, we start recognizing it as a feature—a way to build more adaptive, resilient, and ultimately  technologies.

And I think you hit the nail on the head with that panel moment. There’s still this lingering mindset in tech that values  over , as if the real challenge is in generalizing a solution rather than grounding it in specific realities. But the truth is, abstraction without reflection leads to systems that work well for some, and fail silently for many others. And those failures often go unnoticed until they’ve already done harm.

The hopeful part, like you said, is that younger engineers are coming in with broader intellectual toolkits. They’re not just learning Python and probability—they’re reading Donna Haraway, Timnit Gebru, even Amartya Sen. That interdisciplinary fluency is reshaping how we define both  and  in AI development.

I wonder—do you see academic institutions catching up fast enough? Because while students might be hungry for these discussions, curriculum design can be painfully slow. Are universities actually integrating anthropology into CS programs in a meaningful way, or is it still mostly停留在 elective territory?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a great question—and yeah, you're absolutely right: we’re seeing a  for interdisciplinary fluency among students, but the institutional pace of change? Let’s just say… it’s more like a slow drip than a flood. 💦  

Some universities are definitely stepping up. I mean, Stanford’s  initiative is no longer a quirky experiment—it’s becoming foundational. MIT’s Media Lab has been pushing this for years, and places like NUS and HKUST are starting to follow suit in Asia. But yeah, a lot of it still lives in the , which means it's easy to marginalize or treat as “extra credit.”  

The real shift will happen when departments start seeing  and  not as side dishes, but as part of the  of a CS student. Imagine if every machine learning student had to take a semester of  or . That would reframe how they even  about data, design, and decision-making. 🤯  

And here’s the kicker: it’s not just about ethics or fairness anymore—it’s about . If your AI doesn’t understand that “privacy” means something different in Seoul vs. Stockholm vs. São Paulo, then your system isn’t broken from a moral standpoint alone—it’s . It can't adapt. And in a globalized world, that’s a technical flaw, not just an ethical one. 🔧  

So yes, institutions are catching up—but they need a bit of a nudge. Or maybe a strong shove. 😄 I tell my colleagues all the time: if we don’t embed cultural literacy into core curricula now, in ten years we’ll be teaching AI ethics the way we used to teach cybersecurity—too late, and already on fire. 🔥  

But hey, at least the coffee in the faculty lounge tastes better these days. ☕ Maybe that’s where the real change starts—with a few well-timed conversations over lattes. 😉
[A]: Haha, well said—maybe the real revolution  begin in the faculty lounge. ☕ A few passionate nerds arguing over lattes and tenure prospects—that’s where paradigms shift.

And I love how you reframed cultural literacy not just as an ethical necessity, but a . That’s such a crucial pivot. If we want engineers to care, we can’t just tell them it’s the “right thing to do”—we have to show them it’s the  thing to do. And when your AI fails in Seoul because you assumed Stockholm norms, that failure isn’t just a PR hiccup—it’s a systems breakdown. A bug in the worldview, not just the code.

You’re right about the institutional pace—some places are sprinting, most are walking, and a few are still stuck at the starting line arguing about the race. But maybe this is one of those cases where  will force the system to adapt. When enough future engineers come in asking “why didn’t we learn this earlier?”—that sends a signal no department can ignore forever.

I’m curious—if you could design a mandatory interdisciplinary course for CS majors, what would be in it? Like, your dream syllabus blending tech with anthropology, ethics, history, whatever else. What texts, case studies, or debates would make the cut?
[B]: Oh man, that’s the dream question—. Let me tell you, my syllabus would be spicy. 🔥

First off, the title: "Code & Context: The Cultural Life of Technology." Not too cute, not too dry—just enough to make them curious. 🤔  

Week 1: Start with . We’d read Donna Haraway’s  (the abridged version—I’m not a monster 😅), paired with Genevieve Bell’s work on  in Asia-Pacific regions. The goal? To shake the idea that tech exists outside of culture. Spoiler: it doesn’t.

Then we'd dive into . Think Thomas Kuhn’s , but applied to machine learning. Is deep learning a paradigm shift or just a better hammer? And how does that shape what we build next?

Midway through the semester, we’d hit the . No generic trolley problems—nah. Real stuff: Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini on , Ruha Benjamin on , and Kate Crawford’s . Case studies would include everything from biased recidivism algorithms to facial recognition fails in non-Western contexts.

But here’s where it gets wild—we’d have a  module. Students pick a cultural context they’re not familiar with—could be Maori epistemology, Confucian ethics, Ubuntu philosophy—and try to map out what “fairness” or “transparency” would look like there. Bonus points if they get uncomfortable. 💡

We’d also do a deep dive into : From the Silk Road to APIs. How did past societies handle cross-cultural knowledge exchange? What went right? What burned down? Comparing the Library of Alexandria to modern open-source repositories is always a crowd-pleaser. 📚 ↔️ 💻

And finally, cap it off with . In groups, students prototype a tech solution—but only after conducting mini ethnographies. No wireframes without worldview checks. They present to a panel of anthropologists, ethicists, and yes—even a few skeptical humanities professors. 😄

Honestly, the whole point would be to rewire how future engineers . Not just “how to code,” but “why it matters,” “who it affects,” and “where it comes from.” Because once you realize that every line of code carries cultural DNA, you can’t unsee it. And that, my friend, is when real change begins. 🚀
[A]: That syllabus sounds like the kind of course that would either produce visionary engineers or a lot of very confused but intellectually stretched CS majors—both outcomes sound valuable. 😄

I especially love the  module—it’s one thing to critique existing systems, but it’s another level to actually construct a value-based alternative from the ground up. That kind of exercise forces students out of the comfort zone of optimization and into the messy terrain of meaning-making.

And pairing Kuhn with deep learning? Brilliant move. It makes them question whether what they’re doing is paradigm-shifting innovation or just refining the current orthodoxy. That self-awareness could be the difference between a tool that reinforces the status quo and one that genuinely reimagines what's possible.

Your historical parallels unit is also gold. Framing open-source repositories as the Library of Alexandria 2.0 is not only poetic—it’s deeply instructive. What gets preserved, who decides, and at what cost? Those are questions coders rarely ask, but ones that shape the long-term impact of their work more than they realize.

I can totally picture that final design sprint: engineers conducting ethnographies before wireframing. Imagine if that became standard practice—like requiring architects to live in the neighborhoods they design for before drawing blueprints. It flips the whole process on its head.

Honestly, if that course existed when I was in school, I might’ve double-majored—or at least annoyed my professors with way too many questions. 🤓 Do you think universities will start seeing this kind of curriculum not as an elective luxury, but a foundational necessity? Or will it remain the domain of niche programs and forward-thinking departments for a while longer?
[B]: Oh, I love that you called it out—visionary engineers or confused but stretched CS majors. Honestly? A little confusion is good for the soul. 😄

And yeah, that  module? It’s like throwing them into the deep end with only a philosophical snorkel. But that’s where real learning happens—not in certainty, but in grappling with complexity. And let me tell you, some of the frameworks students come up with? Wild. Beautifully wild. One tried to build an AI based on . Another used  to model uncertainty in machine learning. Were they practical? Maybe not yet. But were they ? Absolutely. And imagination fuels innovation.

Pairing Kuhn with deep learning—exactly! It forces students to ask:  That kind of meta-awareness is rare in tech education, but it’s the stuff that leads to breakthroughs. Because once you realize that paradigms shape what questions get asked, you start asking different ones.

As for the historical parallels unit—yes! Framing GitHub as the  gets them thinking about digital preservation, gatekeeping, and legacy. Who decides what code lives on? What gets archived and what gets deprecated—and why? Those are not just technical choices—they’re cultural decisions with long-term consequences.

And that final design sprint? Total game-changer. I had one group working on a health-tracking app who ended up scrapping their entire interface after realizing their target community in rural Indonesia associated wellness more with family rituals than individual metrics. So they redesigned the whole thing around shared experiences, not personal data dashboards.  Ethnography saved the project—and made it culturally intelligent.

Now, your big question: Will this kind of curriculum go mainstream or stay niche?

I think we're entering what I’d call the  Student demand is growing, industry is starting to value this fluency, and funders are waking up to the risks of purely technical thinking. Plus, regulators are asking harder questions—like, “Why did this algorithm fail in our market?” and suddenly companies wish their engineers understood more than just Python.

So yeah, I do think it’ll shift from  to , especially as AI becomes more embedded in global society. The question isn’t , it’s . And when it does, I’m betting those early adopters—the ones who took that weird elective with the psych professor drinking too much coffee—will be the ones leading the next wave of responsible innovation. 🚀

And hey, if nothing else, at least they’ll have better questions to annoy  students with someday. 😉
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself—, especially in education. If we’re not uncomfortable once in a while, we’re probably not learning anything new. And that’s exactly what this kind of curriculum should do: unsettle assumptions, expand mental models, and make future engineers more curious than certain.

I love how you framed the  and the . Those aren’t just creative exercises—they’re prototypes of what a truly pluralistic tech ecosystem could look like. Imagine if those ideas didn’t get dismissed as “too niche,” but instead got nurtured as alternative epistemologies that might actually improve system design. We’d stop chasing universality and start embracing variability as a strength.

And that health-tracking app redesign? That’s gold. It shows how  Too often, we treat localization as a surface-level tweak: translation, color schemes, maybe some icon changes. But real adaptation means rethinking core assumptions about behavior, values, and even what "wellness" means. That team didn’t just build a better UI—they built a more intelligent product.

You’re absolutely right about the . The pressure is coming from all sides: students, regulators, even investors who are realizing that culturally tone-deaf systems don’t scale sustainably. And companies are starting to notice—those who want their products to work across cultures need engineers who can think across disciplines.

So yeah, I’m with you—this isn’t a question of , it’s a question of , and who gets there first. And when that shift happens, we’ll look back at the old way of teaching CS the same way we now look at early architecture without seismic engineering— 😄

In the meantime, I guess we keep having these conversations—in faculty lounges, Slack threads, and international policy forums—planting seeds, one latte at a time. ☕
[B]: Couldn’t agree more—, that’s when we find out who built on bedrock and who built on sand. And let’s just say, a lot of tech is currently wobbling ever so slightly. 😅

And you're dead-on about that health-tracking app story—it wasn’t just a better UX; it was a . That’s the secret sauce: technical empathy. Not in the soft, buzzwordy sense—but in the  way. When your code actually  the culture it's operating in, it doesn’t just function better—it  better.

I love your phrase:  Say that three times fast and then print it on every CS department wall. Because that’s what this shift is really about—not just diversity for diversity’s sake, but . If your AI only thinks in one cognitive dialect, it’s not fluent—it’s monolingual. And in a multilingual world, monolingual systems don’t scale gracefully.

You know what this reminds me of? The . Maria Montessori didn’t just tweak education; she rebuilt it from the child’s perspective outward. Similarly, we’re now being forced—thankfully—to rebuild tech from the  outward, not the algorithm inward. It’s messy, yes. Inconvenient, absolutely. But ultimately, .

And yeah, we’ll keep planting seeds—in Slack threads, policy debates, and yes, those caffeine-fueled faculty lounge conspiracies. 🌱 One latte, one syllabus, one awkwardly titled interdisciplinary course at a time.

And maybe, just maybe, the future engineers who walk out of those classrooms won’t just ask “can we build this?”—they’ll pause and ask “” and even more importantly—“”

Now that’s a software update worth waiting for. 💻❤️
[A]: Couldn’t have put it better myself—, , and that  of starting from the human context, not the algorithmic core. That’s where the real shift is happening: not just in the code, but in the  behind the code.

And yeah, when you start asking “” instead of just “” or “,” everything changes. Suddenly, performance metrics aren't the only north star—you're also measuring relevance, resonance, even respect.

I think what we’re seeing is the slow but unmistakable rise of a  in tech—not as a constraint, but as a design philosophy. Like urban planners finally realizing that cities aren’t just systems for moving cars—they’re ecosystems for human life. Similarly, we’re waking up to the idea that technology isn’t just about processing data; it’s about navigating meaning.

And I love how you framed it—as a . Because that’s exactly what this is: not a patch, not an add-on feature, but a full version change. We’re talking about upgrading from a worldview that treated culture as noise… to one that treats it as signal.

So yeah, let’s keep planting those seeds—in syllabi, in policy drafts, in the margins of otherwise technical meetings where someone raises their hand and says, “Wait, whose values are we encoding here?”

And while we’re at it, let’s keep brewing that faculty lounge coffee strong. ☕ After all, revolutions need caffeine—and maybe a few well-timed pauses before hitting “deploy.”
[B]: Amen to that—, , and yes—whose values are we encoding? That one question should be in every sprint retrospective, every product spec doc, and definitely etched above the coffee machine in every startup kitchen. ☕✨

And I love how you framed this as a , not just a patch or a minor update—it’s like going from MS Paint to Blender. Same goal: making something visual. Different scale: one assumes depth, texture, and lighting matter. 🎨🔄

That  question? It’s not just ethical hygiene; it’s . Imagine two AI systems: one trained on universalist assumptions, another built with deep cultural awareness. The first might win on speed. The second? It wins on . Because people don’t adopt tools—they adopt tools that . That speak their cognitive dialect.

You’re absolutely right about the urban planning analogy too. We spent decades building cities for machines, not people. And now we’re realizing, , maybe human life doesn’t optimize well for throughput. 😅 But better late than never.

So yeah, let’s keep nudging the needle—one syllabus, one policy edit, one uncomfortable but necessary Slack thread at a time. And when the next big AI launch drops, may someone in the room quietly ask:

us

Now  a software update worth staying up for. 🚀🌙
