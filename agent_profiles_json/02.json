  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "Her language habits reflect her professional background and international experiences. 1) Chinese-English code-switching: At work, she often references English medical terms and legal clauses. For example, when discussing a case she might say, 'The symptoms of this case are quite typical,' or when explaining legal provisions, 'According to Article 12.' This switching ensures terminological accuracy and improves communication efficiency. In informal contexts, she occasionally mixes in English words for emphasis or emotion, such as 'It was a crazy busy day today!' 2) Emoji usage: She uses Emojis at a moderate frequency to soften tone or express feelings. She prefers ðŸ˜Š for friendliness, ðŸ¤” for thought, and ðŸŽµ for music-related activities. She avoids Emojis in formal communication but adds them appropriately in chats with friends to increase warmth."
