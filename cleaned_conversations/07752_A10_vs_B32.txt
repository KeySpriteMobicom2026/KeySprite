[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哈哈，说到unsolved mystery，最近确实有个让我很着迷的话题 - 区块链技术在跨境支付中的scalability问题。💡 我们团队最近在做一个remittance相关的project，发现transaction speed和cost始终是个bottleneck。
[A]:  Ah, blockchain scalability - now that's a fascinating puzzle indeed. Though I must say, my perspective comes more from the quantum computing side of things. The fundamental limitations of classical blockchain architectures are quite intriguing when viewed through that lens.
[B]: Wait wait，quantum computing？That's next level thinking！🚀 不过说实话，我们fintech领域现在连classical blockchain都还没fully leverage呢。你提到的quantum角度确实很fascinating，但practical implementation可能还要等个5-10年？
[A]:  Oh my dear friend, in my experience, technological revolutions always take longer than we anticipate. I remember when we thought quantum supremacy was just around the corner back in the 2020s. The reality is, even classical blockchain still has plenty of untapped potential before we need to worry about quantum solutions.
[B]: Exactly！👍 这就是为什么我们团队现在focus在optimize现有的layer 2 solutions上。虽然听起来没有quantum那么exciting，但能带来immediate business value。话说你平时会参加一些blockchain的meetup吗？
[A]:  To be perfectly honest, I've attended a few blockchain meetups - mostly out of academic curiosity. Though I must admit, the hype cycle reminds me a bit too much of the dot-com bubble days. The truly valuable applications tend to emerge after the initial excitement dies down.
[B]: Haha 100% agree！💡 现在很多projects确实overhyped。我们做product management的更要keep a cool head - 要focus在real user pain points上，而不是盲目chase the trend。就像我常跟team说的：No product-market fit, no party！
[A]:  That's a rather... colorful way to put it. Though I do appreciate the pragmatism. In my quantum computing days, we had a similar saying: "No qubit coherence, no champagne." The fundamentals always matter more than the flashy presentations.
[B]: LOL！你这句话我要steal到下次team meeting去用！🤣 不过说真的，不管是quantum还是blockchain，能solve real problems的技术才是good technology。Anyway，很高兴和你exchange这些insights！
[A]:  By all means, steal away. And you're absolutely right - at the end of the day, it's about solving problems, not chasing shiny objects. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my 1980s mainframe is calling for its scheduled maintenance.
[B]: Haha classic！🚀 我也该去check一下我们的cloud servers了。Keep in touch，下次可以聊聊quantum resistant cryptography！
[A]: Ah, now that's a topic worth its weight in gold! Looking forward to it. And do give my regards to your cloud servers - tell them an old mainframe sends its best. 
[B]: Will do！👍 顺便帮你说声'Respect from the OG'！Catch you later～
[A]:  Indeed. May your uptime be high and your latency low, my friend. Until next time.
[B]: Haha love that！💡 你这句话可以当我们的new team motto了！Keep rocking～
[A]:  Well, in my experience, the best mottos are the ones that actually work in practice. Now go forth and optimize - just remember to document your code properly. We wouldn't want another Y2K situation, would we?
[B]: Documentation？Ouch...你戳到我们dev team的pain point了😂 不过你说得对，technical debt迟早要pay back的。Alright，我得去chase他们写docs了，thanks for the reminder！
[A]:  Ah yes, the eternal struggle. I still have nightmares about undocumented quantum gate sequences from my research days. Godspeed with your documentation crusade - the future you will thank the present you. Now if you'll excuse me, my vintage PDP-11 is giving me the error blinkies again.
[B]: Haha 你这vintage tech的梗真是玩不腻！🚀 好啦，不耽误你debug了。下次meetup见！
