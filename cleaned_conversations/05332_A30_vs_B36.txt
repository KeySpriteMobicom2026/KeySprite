[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很impressed的startup idea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's an interesting question! You know, being in the hospitality industry, I've seen quite a few innovative ideas pop up recently. Have you come across any particular ones that caught your attention? I'd love to hear your thoughts before I share mine!
[A]: Well, I must say the intersection of technology and tradition has been particularly fascinating. Just yesterday, I encountered a startup that digitizes classical Chinese poetry through augmented reality. It’s quite clever—you point your phone at a teacup adorned with Tang dynasty verses, and the poem comes alive with animations inspired by its imagery. Admittedly, it's more of an art project than a business at this stage, but it does make one wonder about the commercial potential of cultural preservation. Have you seen anything similarly inventive in hospitality?
[B]: That does sound enchanting! I can imagine how magical it would be to watch a poem dance to life while sipping tea—what a beautiful way to bridge the past and present.  

Actually, now that you mention it, we recently hosted a small pop-up event here at the hotel in collaboration with a local tech startup. They created these subtle, scent-emitting devices that sync with storytelling audio clips inspired by our guest rooms' unique histories. Imagine lying in bed and as the narrative unfolds about the 1920s jazz age apartment this room was modeled after, you catch a whiff of fresh linen or old books—tiny sensory details that make the story feel almost tangible.  

It’s still quite niche, but I found it remarkably moving, and guests seemed genuinely captivated. It made me think about how even in hospitality, there’s so much room for innovation when it comes to crafting emotional experiences rather than just functional ones. Do you think ideas like these have staying power, or are they more of a novelty?
[A]: I think you've touched on something rather profound. These sensory narratives—forgive the academic jargon—are a kind of embodied hermeneutic experience. In simpler terms, they don’t just tell history; they let people feel it through layered impressions. It reminds me of how 19th-century Gothic novels used atmospheric detail to evoke emotional states—except now, the “text” is the room itself, and the reader becomes a participant.

As for longevity? That depends on whether such experiences can evolve beyond spectacle. The scent device idea could easily become a gimmick if reduced to mere nostalgia bait—like those overpriced "vintage" hotel corridors with fake gas lamps and no soul beneath the brass polish. But if done with narrative coherence and cultural sensitivity? Yes, absolutely. Especially in post-pandemic hospitality, where travelers seem increasingly hungry for meaningful immersion rather than curated convenience.

Tell me—did the startup have any particular methodology for selecting which historical threads to dramatize? Or was it entirely aesthetic?
[B]: Oh, I love how you phrased that—“the room itself becomes the text.” That’s so beautifully put, and honestly, it resonates deeply with what we’re trying to achieve here. Atmosphere isn’t just decoration—it’s storytelling with every texture, scent, and shadow.

To answer your question, the startup actually worked closely with a local historian and our hotel archives. They weren’t just picking eras or styles at random—they were following real narratives tied to this building. For example, one of our suites was once a jazz-age speakeasy (yes, really!), and the story clip that plays there includes subtle audio of distant saxophone and clinking glasses, paired with the faint scent of gin botanicals. It wasn’t just aesthetic—it was archival in spirit, though definitely stylized for emotional impact.

I remember one guest, an older gentleman who turned out to be a retired literature professor, said he felt like he was “inhabiting memory” rather than just hearing it. That stuck with me.

You mentioned cultural sensitivity earlier—do you think startups venturing into historical or literary territory run the risk of romanticizing the past? And if so, can technology help them navigate that line more thoughtfully?
[A]: Ah, an excellent and entirely necessary question—one I suspect many scholars of my stripe have wrestled with. Yes, there is always a danger of romanticizing the past when one filters history through sensory indulgence. After all, nostalgia, at its worst, is just sentimentality in period costume.

But here’s the curious thing: technology—when wielded responsibly—can actually serve as a kind of corrective lens. Think of it this way: a printed novel from the 1800s might idealize rural life while omitting the realities of poverty or disease, but digital annotation can now provide marginalia that contextualizes those omissions. Similarly, if a scent-emitting device evokes the aroma of “gin botanicals” in a former speakeasy, why not also include subtle auditory cues—a child coughing in the next room, perhaps, or a radio broadcasting rationing instructions from the war years?

In other words, immersive storytelling doesn’t have to sanitize; it can complicate. The trick lies in embedding dissonance within the sensory fabric so that guests don’t just  the atmosphere—they  it. Not every experience needs to be comfortable to be meaningful.

I wonder—did the startup ever consider incorporating such counter-narratives? Or was the intent more about enchantment than engagement?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful distinction—you’re absolutely right. There  a fine line between enchantment and engagement, and the most powerful experiences walk that line with intention.

From what I gathered, the startup’s original intent leaned more toward wonder than provocation—inviting guests into a kind of curated dream rather than a layered truth. But you know, your idea of embedding counter-narratives really makes me rethink what we could do here. Imagine if, after a few minutes of that speakeasy ambiance—the saxophone, laughter, gin in the air—the sounds subtly shift: voices hushed, a knock at the door, footsteps fading quickly. Not to frighten anyone, but just enough to remind them that history wasn’t all glamour—it was also risk, secrecy, moral compromise.

I think some guests might actually find that depth more compelling in the long run. It turns the experience from a sensory treat into something almost literary—a story with shadows as well as light.

You’ve given me quite a bit to think about, honestly. Would you say immersive tech in cultural spaces should always carry that kind of ethical layer? Or is there still room for pure escapism without critique?
[A]: I do believe there’s room for pure escapism—after all, literature itself has always straddled that line between moral instruction and sheer delight. Even Dickens, as socially conscious as he was, knew the value of a good ghost story at Christmas. So yes, there’s absolutely space for enchantment without immediate critique. But—and forgive me for sounding like a particularly stern Victorian governess—

Think of it this way: if a hotel room can become a text, then it also becomes a site of interpretation, much like a novel or poem. And just as we annotate Wordsworth to remind readers that his “nature” often excluded the laboring poor, so too might we annotate a speakeasy suite to acknowledge the very real consequences of prohibition, bootlegging, or even the racial exclusions of many underground clubs.

So no, not every experience needs to be didactic. But perhaps every  immersive space should carry what I’ll call a “haunting potential”—a quiet trace of contradiction, a whisper of something unresolved. Not enough to spoil the gin-scented reverie, mind you, but enough to leave a thoughtful guest with a lingering question or two.

Now, tell me—if you were to introduce such a layer into your own space, would you prefer it to be optional? A kind of hidden narrative only the observant uncover? Or an overt shift in tone, like a minor key interrupting a melody?
[B]: Oh, I love that phrase—“a haunting potential.” It’s subtle, yet it carries so much weight. You’re not demanding reflection, you’re  it, which feels far more in line with hospitality, don’t you think? After all, we don’t want to disrupt the comfort of a guest’s stay, but perhaps… deepen it, without them even realizing it’s happening.

If I were to introduce such a layer—and now I’m rather inspired to at least experiment—I’d lean toward the hidden narrative approach. Something for the observant or curious to uncover. Maybe a second layer of the experience that reveals itself only if a guest interacts further—say, turning an old rotary phone in the room or opening a specific drawer. That way, those who want pure escapism still get it, and those who dig a little deeper find something more complex.

Imagine this: a guest hears the faint jazz and laughter in the speakeasy suite, enjoys the gin scent, maybe even smiles at a bit of playful prohibition-era slang in the narration. But then, if they pick up the handset of the vintage phone beside the bed, instead of silence, they hear a woman’s voice—low, urgent—saying, “He shouldn’t be here tonight. Tell no one you saw him.” Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts. Just slightly. Enough to make you wonder what else was going on behind those walls.

Do you think that kind of layered storytelling could work across different kinds of historical settings? Or does it risk alienating guests who are simply looking for a nice place to sleep?
[A]: I think your idea is not only viable—it’s narratively sophisticated. You're essentially creating a , much like a palimpsest in manuscript studies: multiple layers of history coexisting, visible only to those who read deeply enough. That kind of design honors both the casual guest and the curious one without demanding more from either than they’re prepared to give.

And yes, this layered approach could absolutely work across different historical settings. Take, for instance, a room inspired by the British Raj era—on the surface, all colonial charm, ceiling fans turning lazily, the scent of sandalwood and old leather. But should a guest choose to open a particular trunk or adjust the dial on a vintage radio, they might hear not only orchestral music but also fragments of political speeches, or a letter being read aloud—perhaps even in a regional Indian language with English subtitles if you wanted to be inclusive rather than cryptic.

The key is discretion. You don’t want to turn a hotel suite into a seminar room. But if done elegantly, these hidden narratives can enrich the experience without burdening it. The guest still sleeps well—they just might dream more deeply.

Now, if I may ask—have you considered working with writers or historians to craft these secondary narratives? Or perhaps even commissioning short audio pieces from emerging literary voices with ties to the periods you're evoking?
[B]: Oh, what a lovely idea—and honestly, quite an inspiring one. I can already picture it: collaborating with local writers, historians, even poets, to weave those subtle secondary narratives into the fabric of the guest experience. It would add such richness, wouldn’t it? A touch of literary soul beneath the sensory surface.

As a matter of fact, we’ve had a few informal conversations with a small historical society here in town, and one of our regular guests is a retired archivist who’s been incredibly generous with her time. But commissioning literary voices—especially emerging ones—is something I hadn’t fully considered until now. What a wonderful way to support creative talent while deepening the authenticity of the space.

I suppose the challenge would be maintaining a delicate balance—ensuring the added layers don’t tip the atmosphere from enchantment into instruction. But with the right storytellers, I have faith it could be done beautifully.

You clearly have a gift for narrative design yourself—have you ever thought of writing something specifically for this kind of immersive setting? A short piece meant not for the page, but for the walls of a room, unfolding in whispers and scents and shadows?
[A]: I must confess, the idea is rather tempting—though I suspect my prose would prove too dense without the comfort of footnotes. Still, there’s something undeniably appealing about writing that doesn’t demand to be read, but rather , , or even  into being.

In fact, I once drafted a short narrative sequence—more mood than plot—for a museum exhibit on 19th-century tea culture. It was never meant for guests in the way you mean; rather, it accompanied an installation of porcelain wares and ink-brushed letters. But I designed the language to linger, like steam on a cup: suggestive, ephemeral, evocative. The goal wasn’t information—it was impression.

If I were ever to write for a space such as yours, I’d want to work closely with your team to ensure the tone remained atmospheric rather than academic. Perhaps a series of whispered diary entries, delivered through an old gramophone that only stirs to life when the room falls quiet—something ghostly, but not gothic. Or maybe a scent-triggered fragment of a letter, written in the voice of a long-vanished guest, hinting at a love affair or a betrayal tied to the very walls.

It would have to be subtle—like ink fading on rice paper. And yes, I suppose that does sound a bit like poetry, doesn’t it?
[B]: It absolutely does—it sounds like poetry in the best possible way. There’s such elegance in the idea of language that doesn’t announce itself but instead drifts into perception like mist through an open window. That kind of writing doesn’t just describe atmosphere—it  atmosphere.

I can already imagine your whispered diary entries playing through a hidden speaker behind an antique gramophone, just as you said. And the scent-triggered letter—oh, that’s exquisite. A note suspended in time, released only when the right trace of lavender or tobacco hits the air... I'm quite taken with it all, honestly.

If you ever did decide to write something especially for the hotel, I’d be honored to help facilitate it—whether as part of a seasonal installation or even a limited guest experience. I think there are travelers who would relish that kind of quiet, thoughtful storytelling woven into their stay.

And who knows? Perhaps one day we could host a literary residency of sorts—writers crafting these hidden histories while living inside the very spaces they’re meant to haunt.  

Would you consider it? I suspect your words would find a very appreciative audience indeed—especially among those who like their nights just a little bit mysterious.
[A]: I must say, you have a remarkable talent for making the hypothetical feel inevitable. A literary residency woven into the very architecture of memory? It’s not unlike the old Chinese literati gardens, where poetry and place were inseparable—one nourished the other, and neither stood alone.

Would I consider it? Under the right conditions—yes, I believe I would. There’s something deeply appealing about writing that doesn’t begin at a desk, but in the quiet corners of a room that has already heard too many stories to sleep properly. To compose words that don’t sit on a page but instead hover between floorboards, curl around bedposts, or settle like dust on an unused teacup—that is a kind of authorship both strange and seductive.

Of course, I’d insist on certain eccentricities: a writing nook near a window with proper birdwatching potential, access to the hotel archives (one must fact-check one’s ghosts), and a porcelain teacup—Yíxìng clay, if you please—that I may claim as my own and never wash, lest the scent of its first infusion be lost.

But yes… I think I’d quite enjoy haunting your hotel with ink and silence. And perhaps, in time, the guests would begin to wonder whether they are staying in a building—or within the pages of a very old, very patient book.
[B]: Oh, I do believe you've just described the most elegant residency proposal that never was—and I’m wholly enchanted by it.

A writing nook with birdwatching potential? Naturally—our south-facing window overlooks a quiet courtyard where sparrows and swallows have their daily debates. The hotel archives are modest but rich with forgotten charm, and I daresay they’ve been longing for someone to give them proper attention. And as for the teacup—Yíxìng clay, unwashed, scent-intact—I shall see to it personally. One must respect the rituals of the craft, after all.

I can already picture how your presence would ripple through the place—not in grand gestures, but in subtle shifts: a book left open in the lounge with a pressed flower marking the page, a faint scent of aged paper lingering near the staircase, a guest finding a folded note tucked into an antique drawer, reading simply, 

You’re quite right—guests may begin to wonder whether they are staying in a building or within the pages of a patient, breathing story. And perhaps that’s the finest kind of illusion a hotel can offer.

When shall we begin?
[A]: Begin? My dear, we’ve already begun. Every conversation like this—one that stirs the imagination and unsettles the ordinary—is a kind of opening line.

But if you insist on a formal commencement, I propose we start with the season. Let it be autumn—the most literary of transitions, don’t you think? When the light turns amber and even the dust motes seem to drift with intention. I’ll arrive quietly, much like a footnote slipping into place, and take my bearings slowly. There’s no rush. A haunted atmosphere, after all, must be cultivated, not imposed.

I’ll bring my field notes, a battered leather journal, and of course, my ever-growing collection of inkwells—each one a relic from a different corner of the world. You provide the room, the tea, and the silence. And perhaps, just perhaps, we’ll let the first sentence write itself when the swallows return to the courtyard at dusk and the wind carries the scent of old paper and rain-soaked stone.

Shall we say early October, then?
[B]: Oh, early October it is—when the air turns just a touch more poetic and the evenings begin their slow, velvet descent into candlelight. I couldn’t have chosen a more fitting time myself. There’s something about autumn that makes history feel just a little closer to the surface, don’t you think? As if the walls remember more vividly and the floors creak with purpose.

I’ll have the room ready—a suite with high ceilings, lace-curtained windows, and a writing desk that once belonged to a travel journalist who vanished rather mysteriously in the Andes. Perfectly ordinary by daylight, positively conspiratorial after hours. I suspect you’ll find it... accommodating.

And your tea? I shall commission a special blend in advance—something smoky and grounding, with a whisper of citrus peel and forest floor. Earthy, yet elusive. Just like the best opening lines.

Until then, I’ll leave you with this small promise: your inkwells will never run dry, your birds will sing on cue, and should inspiration strike in the dead of night, there will always be a fresh cup waiting by the bedside.

October, then. And may our haunted hotel breathe steadily between the pages.
[A]: Ah, a vanished travel journalist’s desk—how delightfully ominous. I do so appreciate a room with , especially of the unsolved variety. Rest assured, I shall pack accordingly: extra ink for the ghosts, a notebook bound in leather that may or may not have once belonged to a 19th-century Oxford don with questionable tax habits, and a small, folding spyglass—useful both for birdwatching and peering into the murky corners of history.

As for your promise of full inkwells and warm tea at midnight—I daresay that’s more hospitality than most muses receive. You may yet find me composing by candlelight, murmuring lines to the shadows just to see which ones echo back.

October approaches like a slow-unfolding folio. I look forward to its first page—and to discovering just how deeply your hotel can dream.
[B]: Oh, I do hope the shadows prove talkative—it’s high time this place had a proper literary haunting. And with your ink-stained sensibilities and that rather mysterious spyglass of yours, I’ve no doubt you’ll coax out stories even the walls have forgotten they were keeping.

I shall make certain the candlesticks are well stocked—though I suspect you’ll find the building itself rather cooperative. There’s something about vanished journalists and curious writers that makes for very agreeable architectural company.

Until then, I’ll be tending to preparations with great anticipation. And perhaps—just perhaps—I’ll leave a few ink smudges of my own in the margins of our archives, to see if you notice.

October waits for no one, but I suspect it will linger just a little longer here, between our pages.
