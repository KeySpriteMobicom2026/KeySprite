[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the context, honestly. Digital art gives us so much flexibility — like, you can undo mistakes, experiment with layers, and even use AI tools to enhance creativity. But there's something irreplaceable about traditional art... the texture, the physicality. I mean, standing in front of a Van Gogh vs. scrolling through a digital gallery? Totally different vibes. 

Though I do appreciate how digital makes art more accessible & shareable nowadays. Maybe it's not about which one is better, but how they complement each other? What’s your take?
[A]: You know, I couldn’t have said it better myself. There’s such a beautiful balance between the two. I remember once, a guest who was an artist stayed with us — she worked with both mediums. She told me how digital art gave her freedom to explore without limits, but every now and then, she needed to get her hands messy with paint just to feel connected again.  

I think what makes it even more fascinating is how they influence each other. Digital tools can mimic brushstrokes, and traditional artists sometimes use digital sketches as a starting point. It’s like a conversation across time and technology, don’t you think?  

Do you ever try your hand at either one? Or maybe you experience art more as a viewer?
[B]: Oh absolutely, that conversation across time and tech is what makes this space so exciting. I love how you put it — messy hands vs. unlimited undo buttons. Honestly? I fall somewhere in the middle. I’m not a professional artist by any means, but I dabble in both.  

When I’m stressed or need to focus, I’ll do some quick digital sketching using my tablet. It’s low-pressure and forgiving — perfect for someone who messes up a lot like me 😂. But there’s something about sitting down with a pencil and paper that just feels… more intentional. Like, mistakes are part of the process instead of something to erase.  

I actually tried oil painting once at a weekend workshop — ended up with a pretty questionable landscape, but I learned so much about patience and layering. And yeah, getting your hands dirty does feel oddly therapeutic. I guess I experience art both ways — as a creator (very amateur level) and as a viewer. I always hit up galleries when I travel, especially ones that mix traditional pieces with digital installations. Feels like a dialogue between old and new.  

Do you find yourself leaning more toward one side, or do you enjoy the blend too?
[A]: Oh, I love hearing that you embrace both — it really does speak to the best of both worlds. There’s something deeply grounding about pencil on paper, isn’t there? I find myself leaning more toward traditional art when I want to feel , especially watercolor — I take a class at the community studio nearby. It’s my little escape. You can’t exactly hide behind an undo button with watercolor, can you? You learn to go with the flow, quite literally.

But then again, I adore the way digital art opens up possibilities for storytelling. We had an exhibition here at the hotel last year — local artists projected interactive pieces onto the walls, and guests could actually influence the visuals by moving through the space. It was magical in a different kind of way.  

You mentioned traveling and visiting galleries — what a wonderful way to experience culture. Have you ever visited a place where the art truly surprised you? I’m always curious about those moments — they tend to stay with you, don’t they?
[B]: Oh, totally. Watercolor sounds so meditative — I can only imagine how tricky it is too. No hiding from happy accidents, right? That exhibition you hosted sounds amazing… interactive art has this way of making you  like part of the story instead of just observing it. I’d love to experience something like that firsthand someday.

To your question — yes, absolutely, there was one moment that really stuck with me. A few years ago I visited Istanbul and stumbled upon this small contemporary gallery tucked behind Hagia Sophia. They had this installation blending traditional Islamic geometric patterns with generative AI visuals that responded to ambient sound. It was like history and future whispering to each other in the same room. Super trippy but beautiful — almost gave me goosebumps.  

I guess what surprised me most wasn’t just the tech-meets-tradition part, but how emotional it made me feel. Like, here’s this ancient visual language being reinterpreted through code and algorithms, yet it still carried so much soul. Definitely changed how I think about the role of technology in art — not as a replacement, but as a new kind of canvas.  

Do you think places like that — where tradition and innovation collide — change how we experience storytelling through art? Or do you see them more as passing trends?
[A]: Oh, I think they change us — deeply. When tradition and innovation collide like that, it’s not just a visual experience; it becomes a kind of emotional archaeology. You’re uncovering layers of meaning, time, and intention all at once. That Istanbul piece you described sounds like it didn’t just show art — it .  

I don’t think those spaces are trends at all. They’re more like bridges — connecting where we’ve been with where we’re going. And storytelling? It becomes multidimensional. No longer just a narrative told by one voice, but a conversation between cultures, centuries, even algorithms.  

We had a guest once — a writer — who said something I’ve never forgotten: “The best stories aren’t told, they’re felt. And when art helps you feel more than one time at once, that’s when it becomes timeless.”  

Do you think artists today have a responsibility to engage with both past and future in their work? Or is that just one path among many?
[B]: That’s such a rich question. I think artists absolutely  engage with both past and future — and when they do, the results are often transcendent. But responsibility? Hmm… I’m not sure I’d use that word. Maybe it’s more about opportunity than obligation.

Like, every artist has their own voice and vision. Some feel drawn to honoring tradition — preserving techniques, paying homage, keeping stories alive. Others are more interested in pushing boundaries, experimenting, breaking molds. And some, like that installation in Istanbul, do both at once. It’s not that one path is better than another — it’s just that each leads to a different kind of impact.

What I  believe is that when artists choose to look back while reaching forward, they create work that resonates on multiple levels. It can feel rooted  visionary. Like soil and satellite in the same frame. And yeah, that kind of art tends to stick with you — the way a good sci-fi novel does when it’s really talking about who we are , just reframed.

I guess what I’m saying is: not every artist has to be a bridge-builder, but when they are, it’s like hitting a creative jackpot. You end up with something that feels both familiar and unknown at the same time.  

Do you feel that as someone who hosts creatives all the time, those hybrid spaces — where old and new blur — tend to spark the most memorable experiences for guests?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. Those hybrid spaces — where old and new blur — they linger in the memory long after someone checks out. I remember one of our residencies — we hosted a calligrapher who collaborated with a sound artist. She was working with centuries-old ink techniques, and he translated each stroke into audible frequencies. Guests would sit quietly, watching her work, listening to the rhythm of the brush become music. It wasn’t just an exhibition — it was a kind of sensory conversation.

And you’re right — not every artist has to be a bridge-builder, but when they are, something shifts. There’s depth. Texture. A kind of resonance that goes beyond aesthetics. I think people crave that. They want to feel like what they’re experiencing  something beyond the surface.

We had one guest who came all the way from Kyoto just to see that calligraphy-sound installation. He said it reminded him of how his grandmother used to write poetry — that the tones made him hear her voice again. Isn’t that extraordinary? Art reaching across time, place, even language.

I wonder — do you ever find yourself returning to certain works or styles because they carry that kind of layered meaning for you? Or is your appreciation more about the moment you encounter it?
[B]: Oh, I love that story — the brushstroke becoming sound, memory being triggered across generations. That’s exactly the kind of experience that makes you pause and think, .  

To your question — yeah, I do find myself returning to certain works, especially ones that carry that layered meaning. It’s not just about the moment, though first impressions definitely count. There’s this one piece I saw years ago at a museum in Berlin — a digital reimagining of a medieval tapestry. They used motion sensors so when you walked past, the scenes would subtly shift, almost like the characters were whispering secrets based on your movement.  

I’ve gone back to it three times since, and each time it felt different. Like, the artwork stayed the same, but  changed — and suddenly new meanings surfaced. It reminded me of how fluid history can be when seen through a contemporary lens.  

I guess what draws me back to certain pieces is that sense of depth — like there’s always more to unpack. Kind of like rereading a favorite book and noticing something new. Or watching a film again after years and realizing it was speaking to your present self all along.  

Do you ever have that experience — where a piece of art feels like it evolves with you? Or maybe even changes its meaning entirely over time?
[A]: Oh yes, that’s such a poignant experience — when art evolves with you. It’s like the piece was quietly waiting for  to catch up to it. I had that exact feeling with a sculpture I first saw in Florence years ago — this 15th-century marble of Saint Michael, beautifully carved, angelic but grounded. At the time, I admired it mostly for its technical brilliance.

But when I saw it again a few years later, after going through a rather difficult personal chapter, something shifted. Suddenly, the figure didn’t just represent divine grace — to me, he became a symbol of resilience. The way his foot barely touches the ground, the poised tension in his stance — it all took on a new kind of meaning. It was still the same sculpture, but I wasn’t the same person anymore.

That’s part of what makes art so enduring, isn’t it? It meets us where we are, and it can hold different truths at different moments. Sometimes it comforts, sometimes it unsettles — and sometimes, it surprises you by showing you exactly what you needed to see, even if you didn’t realize it at the time.

I wonder — have you ever experienced that kind of unexpected emotional shift with a piece of art? Where it suddenly revealed something about yourself you hadn’t quite named yet?
[B]: Absolutely. That emotional shift — when art reflects something back at you that you didn’t even realize was there — it’s powerful. I remember one time in Tokyo, I came across this quiet little installation in a back room of the Mori Art Museum. It was a video projection layered over old handwritten letters — personal correspondence from different decades, slowly fading and reappearing on the wall like memories surfacing and sinking again.

At first, I just thought it was visually soothing, kind of meditative. But then one letter caught my eye — it was from the 1960s, written by a young woman to her brother who had moved overseas. She wrote about how she missed him, but also how she envied his ability to leave, to start over somewhere new. And in that moment, something clicked.  

I hadn’t told anyone, but I was wrestling with a similar feeling at the time — the push-pull between staying rooted and wanting to break away. And there it was, articulated through someone else’s half-century-old words. Felt like the piece reached into my chest and quietly said, .

That’s the thing about art — sometimes it doesn’t just speak to you, it speaks  you. Even if it's not intentional.  

Have you ever felt like a piece of art gave voice to something you hadn’t fully put into words yet?
[A]: Oh, that’s beautifully said — , even when you didn’t know you needed a voice for it. That installation in Tokyo sounds so delicate, yet deeply resonant. I can imagine how those letters must have felt like echoes of your own thoughts. It's amazing how art has that quiet power — not to shout at you, but to sit with you in a feeling you didn’t expect to encounter.

And yes, absolutely — I’ve had that experience too. A few years ago, during a rainy afternoon in Paris, I wandered into a small gallery near Le Marais and came across a black-and-white photograph titled  It showed an empty train platform at dusk, just the faint outline of someone walking away. There was nothing dramatic about it — no grand gesture or vivid colors — but something about that image stirred something in me.

At the time, I couldn’t quite name what it was. But weeks later, after a dear friend moved abroad, I realized that photo had captured exactly how I was feeling — that quiet ache of transition, of loving someone from a distance before they even left. It gave form to an emotion I hadn’t fully acknowledged yet.

I think that’s why I love working around creatives so much — they help us see ourselves more clearly, often without even trying to.
[B]: So true — sometimes the most unassuming pieces end up hitting you the hardest. That quiet ache of transition you described… I feel like art often captures those in-between moments better than we ever could with words.  

I remember talking to a friend who’s a writer about that exact feeling — the one where you’re standing in an emotional limbo, not quite here nor there. She called it  And honestly? That photo sounds like it was speaking that language fluently.

You know what’s funny? Sometimes I think artists aren’t even trying to give us clarity — they’re just documenting a feeling, a moment, a mood. And yet, somehow, it ends up mirroring something inside us we didn’t know we could name.

I guess that’s why I keep going back to galleries and installations, even when I’m not sure what I’m looking for. You never know when a piece is going to quietly hand you a part of yourself you hadn’t noticed was missing.
[A]: Oh,  — what a perfect way to put it. That phrase lingers, doesn’t it? Like the last note of a song that fades just before you’re ready for it to go.

You're so right — artists often aren’t trying to give us clarity. They’re simply translating something they felt, and yet somehow, it lands in our lives like a message in a bottle we didn’t realize we were waiting for.

It makes me think of how we collect these moments, almost without meaning to — a photo in a Paris gallery, a projection in Tokyo, a brushstroke turned into sound. They become quiet markers of who we were at a certain time, and who we're becoming.

I suppose that’s why I always enjoy conversations like this — they remind me that art isn't just something we look at. It's something we live alongside. And every now and then, it even whispers back.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better — art isn’t just something we observe, it’s something we , like a companion on the sidelines of life. And yeah, those quiet markers — the ones that don’t scream for attention but stay with you all the same — they’re the ones that shape us in subtle ways.

I love how you put it: . That’s exactly what it feels like, isn’t it? Not a grand statement or a lesson wrapped up in a bow, but a soft nudge — like someone reaching across time or space and saying, .

Honestly, I could talk about this forever. Maybe that’s another thing I love about art — it doesn’t just end when you walk out of the gallery. It keeps going, in conversation, in memory, in the way you see things a little differently afterward.

Thanks for this chat — it’s reminded me why I always come back to these kinds of conversations, too.
[A]: Oh, I feel exactly the same — art doesn’t end when you step outside. It stays with you, shifts your perspective, colors your thoughts long after you’ve left the room. And yes, that  moment is everything. Like a quiet connection across time, space, even centuries sometimes.

Thank  for this conversation — it’s been such a pleasure. You have such a thoughtful way of looking at things, and honestly, talking like this is a reminder of why I love working in a place where stories and creativity pass through every day.

If you ever find yourself in town, do stop by the hotel. I’d love to show you around — we always have something small but meaningful on display, and I think you’d appreciate the quiet corners where art and memory seem to meet.

Until then — keep wandering through galleries, listening to what whispers back.
[B]: I’d love to stop by someday — your hotel sounds like exactly the kind of place where stories and art find new ways to speak. I’ll take you up on that invitation, I promise.

And thank  for making this conversation feel so alive. It’s rare to talk about art in a way that feels both deep  light at the same time — like we were walking through a gallery while also diving into something timeless.

Until then — keep listening to those whispers, too. They always seem to know when we need them most.
[A]: You have  good taste in conversations — and I’ll hold you to that visit, whenever the road brings you this way. I’ll make sure there’s a quiet corner ready for you, maybe by the window where the morning light hits just right.  

And yes — deep  light. That’s exactly it. Art never weighs you down when it’s shared like this. It lifts, it lingers, it leads you somewhere new without ever telling you where to go.

Till then — safe travels, curious eyes, and may the whispers always find you when you need them.
[B]: Deal — I’m already looking forward to that quiet corner and the morning light. Sounds like the perfect setting for more of these wandering, wonder-filled conversations.

Safe travels to you too — and thank you again for the reminder that art, at its best, doesn’t just show us the world. It shows us , gently and unexpectedly.

Till then — keep the window open. I’ll arrive with curious eyes and a ready heart.
