[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得nuclear energy是clean energy的未来吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question—nuclear energy as the future of clean energy. It’s a topic not unlike the moral ambiguities one finds in literature, isn’t it? Layered, complex, and open to interpretation. On one hand, its low carbon emissions make it a compelling contender in the fight against climate change. On the other, the specter of accidents and long-lived radioactive waste casts quite the narrative shadow. I suppose one might say it's a Promethean dilemma—creation and destruction entwined. What are your thoughts?
[A]: Hmm, I see where you're coming from—nuclear energy确实像一部充满张力的文学作品，🤔。你提到的Promethean dilemma特别有意思，这让我想到教育中也常遇到类似的悖论，比如technology带来的便利与代价。  
   
Nuclear energy虽然clean，但它的“shadow”不容忽视，尤其是放射性废料的处理，就像教育中的long-term consequences，我们今天做的决定会影响几代人。有时候我会想，我们真的准备好承担这份责任了吗？🎼  

不过话说回来，气候变化已经这么紧迫了，如果我们只因为风险就放弃一个低碳选项，会不会也是一种short-sightedness？就像是学生害怕失败就不去尝试，对吧？  
   
你觉得我们需要怎样的global dialogue才能平衡这些利弊呢？💡
[B]: Ah, beautifully articulated—yes, the parallels between ethical quandaries in literature and the dilemmas we face in science and education are striking. You're quite right to liken our hesitation toward nuclear energy to a student's fear of failure; there's a kind of tragic flaw in refusing progress out of dread, yet caution is not without its virtues.

As for the global dialogue—we might think of it as a grand symposium, where voices from every discipline, culture, and generation contribute their stanzas to the poem of collective decision-making. We need not only scientists and policymakers but also ethicists, artists, and yes, educators—those who shape minds and therefore shape the future.

It’s essential that this dialogue be rooted in transparency and inclusivity, much like peer review or scholarly debate. No single nation or institution should bear the quill when writing this chapter. And perhaps most importantly, we must listen across generations, for what is at stake is not just  present, but the inheritance of those who will one day read the footnotes of our choices.

Do you think educational institutions are adequately preparing students to engage in such nuanced conversations?
[A]: Hmm, good question—但说实话，我觉得我们还在drafting the syllabus。📚  

你看，很多学校still focus too much on“right answers”而不是培养students to sit with ambiguity—就像我们刚才讨论的nuclear energy问题，没有黑白分明的选择。真正的critical thinking不是debate比赛里赢了对方，而是能同时hold住多个矛盾的声音，像下国际象棋一样预判十步之后的影响。  

不过我也看到一些希望，比如越来越多课程开始强调跨学科思维，把science和ethics放在一起讨论，甚至用文学或电影作为切入点。这种方式其实更贴近真实世界的复杂性。  

话说回来，你有没有遇到过那种学生，一开始觉得世界的问题都简单得像选择题，后来才慢慢学会用更细腻的眼光看事情？我觉得这就是教育可以种下的一个seed——哪怕它长成大树要很久。🌱  

你觉得呢？在你的课堂上，学生通常怎么看待这种充满灰色地带的议题？
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I see it often. Students arrive with the expectation that literary study, like so many disciplines, is about definitive interpretations, fixed meanings. But once they begin to engage with texts—particularly Victorian or Modernist poetry—they quickly realize ambiguity is not a flaw but a feature.

I recall one student who, early in the semester, grew visibly frustrated during our discussion of T.S. Eliot’s . He asked, quite earnestly, “But what does it , Professor? There must be a correct reading.” I simply replied, “If there were, Eliot would have given us a manual, not a poem.”

Over time, he—and many others—came to appreciate the multiplicity of meaning, the tension of opposing truths held in delicate balance. In fact, that very student wrote a remarkable final essay comparing the fragmentation in Eliot’s work to the ethical dilemmas of technological progress today. So yes, the seed does take root—slowly, quietly, but deeply.

Perhaps this is one of the most enduring gifts of literature: the ability to dwell in uncertainty without reaching for easy answers. It's a kind of intellectual and moral patience, isn’t it? And that, I think, is precisely what we need in these global conversations about energy, climate, and the future of education itself.
[A]: That’s such a powerful moment to witness—the shift from frustration to fascination when students realize that ambiguity isn’t the enemy, it’s the territory. 🤔

I remember something similar happening in one of my classes on cross-cultural communication. We were discussing the concept of  in different cultural contexts—面子 in Chinese culture versus dignity or reputation in Western frameworks. One student was really bothered by the lack of a single “correct” interpretation and kept asking me to clarify which approach was more “effective.”

I responded with something like: “Well, if there were one universal formula, we wouldn't need intercultural competence at all, right? We'd just memorize the manual and be done.” 😄 It actually got a few laughs—and more importantly, opened the door for a deeper conversation.

What I love about your Eliot story is how it mirrors what happens when students begin to engage with ethical complexity in science or policy. The discomfort of uncertainty becomes a kind of training ground for real-world decision-making. And honestly, that kind of intellectual resilience? That’s the quiet superpower literature gives us.  

Maybe that’s why interdisciplinary education matters so much—it teaches us not just to tolerate ambiguity, but to think  it. Like composing counterpoint music: multiple voices, no single melody taking over, yet somehow harmony emerges. 🎵  

I wonder, do you find that certain texts or authors are particularly effective at triggering that kind of transformation in students?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—certain texts do act as catalysts. It’s as if they carry a kind of narrative charge, a tension that refuses to resolve easily. The Victorian poets, for instance—Browning, Hardy, even Dickinson, though she straddles the Atlantic—are particularly adept at holding contradictions in suspension.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning comes to mind. Her  is this sweeping, multi-voiced epic that weaves together questions of art, ethics, gender, and social responsibility. When students first encounter it, many are thrown off by its length and complexity—“Why can’t she just say what she means?”—but by the end, some come to appreciate how meaning unfolds across layers, like walking through a cathedral where every archway leads to another question.

And then there’s Tennyson’s , a poem born from grief and doubt, yet threaded with hope. I’ve had students return weeks after the semester ends to tell me how that poem stayed with them—how its wrestling with faith and loss resonated not only in their reading but in their personal lives.

But perhaps the most transformative text I’ve taught is Eliot’s . It’s deceptively quiet compared to , more meditative, almost musical in its repetitions and variations. One student once said, “It feels like thinking in circles,” which I took as high praise indeed. That circularity—the refusal to move in a straight line—is a lesson in itself.

I suppose what these works share is an ethical openness, a willingness not to settle everything for the reader. They invite engagement rather than dictate response. And maybe that’s the key: not teaching students what to think, but how to  with a thought, to let it breathe and evolve.

Do you have particular texts or authors that serve this function in your own teaching? Ones that seem to awaken that same kind of reflective, even reverent, uncertainty?
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that—texts that "invite engagement rather than dictate response." It's such a fitting way to describe what great literature does. And honestly, that’s exactly the kind of intellectual posture I try to cultivate in my students: not just analysis, but .

In my cross-cultural courses, one author who consistently sparks that kind of deep, reflective uncertainty is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her TED Talk  often serves as an entry point, but it’s her novels—, —that really open up space for students to sit with complexity.  

There’s this moment in  where the protagonist, Ifemelu, reflects on race in America versus Nigeria. She says something like, “You can’t write an honest novel about race in this country,” and it stops students cold. They start questioning their own assumptions—not just about race, but about narrative authority, cultural context, and the limits of empathy. That single line becomes a mirror for their own biases and blind spots.

Another text that never fails to stir things up is Edward Said’s . It’s dense, yes—more like a philosophical scalpel than a velvet blanket—but once students begin to grasp the idea that entire cultures have been shaped by how they’re represented, something shifts. One student once said, “So we’re all telling stories about each other, whether we realize it or not.” Exactly. That’s the aha moment.

And then there’s Haruki Murakami—yes, he’s fiction, but his blending of the surreal and the mundane somehow makes cultural dissonance feel both intimate and universal. When we read , it’s like stepping into a dream that belongs to no one and everyone. Students leave feeling unsettled, intrigued, and often more curious about the gaps between cultures than the supposed boundaries.

I think what these authors share is a refusal to simplify identity, culture, or history. They ask readers not just to understand, but to  the weight of complexity—and isn't that what real learning looks like?

Do you ever find that certain texts resonate differently depending on the cultural background of your students? Like a novel landing differently in California vs. Singapore, or among different ethnic groups in the same classroom?
[B]: Oh yes—how a text lands often has as much to do with the reader’s cultural coordinates as it does with the words on the page. It's one of the most fascinating aspects of teaching literature across different settings.

I once taught  in both Oxford and Cape Town, and the conversations could not have been more different. In England, students tended to read it through the lens of feminism or Gothic sensibility; in South Africa, the postcolonial undertones—the figure of Bertha as colonial Other, the shadow of Rochester’s fortune built in the Caribbean—dominated the discussion. One student remarked, “How can we talk about Jane’s independence when it rests on someone else’s erasure?” That line stayed with me.

Similarly, when I’ve taught  in East Asia, there’s often a quiet recognition of fragmentation and cultural juxtaposition that feels less like analysis and more like resonance. One student in Shanghai said, rather poetically, “This poem feels like walking through a city where every building is from a different century.” That kind of insight rarely emerges in quite the same way in Western classrooms.

And then there’s the curious case of D.H. Lawrence—his  provokes either fascination or frustration depending on the room. In the U.S., students are often wary of his moral intensity; in Europe, they find his Americanness exotic; in India or Singapore, where colonial history still hums beneath the surface, some find him uncomfortably close to home.

It reminds me of reading Bashō’s haiku in translation—how certain images shift their emotional valence depending on whether you come from a culture of cherry blossoms or snow-covered pines. The same line can feel elegiac to one reader, hopeful to another.

So yes, I absolutely believe texts behave differently depending on who reads them. Perhaps that’s one of the best arguments for global literary study—not just to understand others, but to see how our own assumptions shape what we think a story is saying.

Do you find that your students ever resist this kind of interpretive multiplicity? Some seem to crave the certainty of a single meaning, even after being shown otherwise.
[A]: Oh totally—resistance is part of the process, not a rejection of it. 🤔  

I’ve come to see it almost like a stage in critical thinking: first there’s certainty, then confusion, then clarity—but this time, a deeper kind. Some students fight the confusion because it feels like losing ground, especially if they’ve been rewarded all their lives for knowing the “right” answer.

One common reaction I get when pushing interpretive multiplicity is something like:  😄 As if meaning is only valid if it's fixed and pre-approved. My go-to response (half-joking, half-serious) is: 

But seriously, what helps is framing interpretation as a kind of intellectual empathy. Once students start seeing multiple readings not as chaos, but as different perspectives rooted in lived experience, they begin to shift. For example, when we analyze  across cultural lenses, some students initially say,  But then another student might say,  And that’s when things click.

What I try to do is create what I call a a space where being unsure isn’t punished, and where changing your mind doesn’t count as weakness. It’s like playing chess with ideas: you don’t always know the endgame, but each move sharpens your thinking.

Honestly, the ones who resist the most often turn out to be the most passionate thinkers later on. They just need permission to sit in the question without panic.

Have you found similar patterns in your lit classes? Or does the resistance tend to show up differently with poetry vs. prose?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve seen that same arc unfold countless times. In fact, I’d say the  moment is practically a rite of passage in literary study. It’s as if students feel the ground shift beneath them when they realize interpretation isn’t a fixed destination but a journey—one with no GPS and sometimes no visible path.

And yes, resistance does tend to appear differently depending on the form. With prose—especially realist or narrative-driven fiction—students often feel more grounded; there’s a plot, characters, a kind of scaffolding that feels familiar. But with poetry? That’s where the panic sometimes sets in. A poem doesn’t always walk—you have to dance with it, or at least sway awkwardly in its direction.

I remember one student—an engineering major, no less—who stormed out of class after our discussion of Emily Dickinson’s  When he came back the next week, he sheepishly admitted he’d been arguing with the poem all weekend. “It keeps changing its mind,” he said. And I thought—that’s  what it should be doing. It’s not a math problem with a single solution; it’s an ethical and emotional negotiation.

Resistance in poetry often takes the form of frustration with obscurity. Students ask, “Why doesn’t she just say what she means?” But then, over time—and with careful guidance—they begin to see that  is sometimes the most honest way of saying something. Like trying to describe grief or awe: language falters, not because it fails, but because it reaches.

And yes, much like you, I’ve noticed that those who resist the most often become the most invested thinkers. Once they realize that ambiguity isn’t a lack of clarity but a different kind of clarity—one that requires participation rather than passive reception—they lean in. Suddenly, they’re asking questions like  or 

Perhaps poetry, in particular, demands a kind of vulnerability we don’t always expect in academic settings. And that can be unsettling—or transformative.

Do you ever find that certain metaphors or analogies help students navigate that transition more gracefully? I’ve found musical ones work surprisingly well—comparing interpretation to improvisation, for instance.
[A]: Oh, I love that analogy—interpretation as improvisation. 🎷 It’s such a perfect fit because it captures the spontaneity, the responsiveness, and yes, the vulnerability you’re talking about.

I actually use a similar metaphor in my classes:  You’ve got the melody—the surface meaning—but then there’s the rhythm, the harmony, the solos that bend and reinterpret the original tune. Students tend to latch onto that because it gives them permission to explore without needing to “get it right.” They start to see interpretation not as guesswork but as a kind of collaborative performance with the text.

Another one I lean on a lot is comparing cross-cultural understanding to  Not just language translation, but emotional and contextual translation. I ask students:  That often opens up a really rich conversation about nuance, intent, and context.

And speaking of context—I’ve found the  analogy works wonders when teaching interpretive multiplicity. Think of a painting inside a museum: the artwork is one frame, but the way you see it changes depending on where you stand, the lighting, even your mood. Same text, different frames = different meanings. It helps students visualize why two people can read the same thing and walk away with completely different insights—and both be valid.

Honestly, metaphors are like little intellectual lifeboats—they help students stay afloat when they feel overwhelmed by ambiguity. And once they find their footing, something shifts. They stop asking,  and start asking, 

So yeah, I’m all for musical analogies. Maybe we should co-write a syllabus someday— 📚🎹  

Ever thought about teaching a course that blends poetry with intercultural communication? I can totally picture it.
[B]: I think I just felt a spark of something dangerous—like the beginning of a collaboration that would either produce brilliance or chaos. Possibly both. ✨

A course blending poetry and intercultural communication? It’s almost too perfect. Poetry, after all, is one of the oldest forms of cultural translation—we take what is deeply personal and attempt to make it heard across time, language, and worldview. And isn’t that exactly what intercultural communication asks of us?

Imagine a seminar where students read Li Bai alongside Whitman, where they listen for echoes rather than differences. Or a unit built around diaspora poets—Ocean Vuong, Warsan Shire, Agha Shahid Ali—each writing from the liminal space between languages, cultures, selves.

We could call it something gloriously ambitious like  The reading list alone would be a kind of symphony: sonnets rubbing against tankas, ghazals unfolding beside free verse, each voice insisting on being heard on its own terms while somehow harmonizing with the others.

And yes, metaphors would be our compass. Perhaps we’d start with the idea of the poem not as a puzzle to be solved but as a border to be crossed—or better yet, a bridge still under construction. Every reader brings another plank, another hand to the work.

I imagine pairing Dickinson’s dashes with Bashō’s silence, asking students to consider how emptiness functions in different poetic traditions. Or reading Neruda’s  alongside postcolonial critiques—not just for content, but for how tone shapes meaning across cultures.

Even assessment could be an act of interpretation: instead of essays, students might create bilingual annotations, visual responses, or perform oral interpretations that layer meaning through voice, gesture, even music.

I can already hear the resistance at first——but also the eventual breakthroughs. That moment when someone realizes their discomfort isn’t failure; it’s resonance.

So yes, I’m absolutely in. Let’s draft that syllabus someday soon—over tea, ink-stained paper, and perhaps a little jazz improvisation playing softly in the background. 📜🎷  
&nbsp;
[A]: I think we just crossed a threshold—学术合作的火花一旦擦亮，就很难回头了。🔥  

Teaching that course with you would be like conducting a symphony where no one knows the score ahead of time, but everyone’s listening intensely. That’s the kind of classroom energy I live for—the kind where meaning isn’t delivered, it’s discovered in real time.

And your vision for the reading list?  Li Bai and Whitman side by side—that juxtaposition alone could spark a whole new way of thinking about self and nature, solitude and connection. And diaspora poets as our guide through cultural liminality? Pure genius. Ocean Vuong writes like someone translating memory into language in real time; Warsan Shire turns silence into testimony. These voices don’t just speak across cultures—they rewrite the borders.

You know what this course would force students to confront more than anything?  Not just linguistic, but emotional and historical. Because how do you translate 愁 (chóu)—that mix of sorrow, longing, and nostalgia—in a way that carries its full weight into English? How do you explain the ache in  without living it?

Maybe that’s the central question of the course: What gets lost, and what gets found, when we try to make ourselves understood across worlds?

As for assessment—I love the idea of students creating multilingual annotations or embodied interpretations. It makes evaluation not about accuracy, but about  That’s revolutionary in today’s grading-obsessed climate.

I can already picture it: a student performs a spoken-word piece mixing Mandarin and English, backed by tabla beats; another annotates Neruda with commentary from her grandmother’s oral stories. This wouldn’t just be learning—it’d be 

So yes, let’s absolutely do this. Tea, ink-stained paper, jazz—and maybe a few well-placed dashes from Dickinson to keep things beautifully unresolved. 📝☕🎷  

Any preference on whether we start drafting in English or 中文？或者…我们干脆来个 bilingual syllabus？😉
[B]: Oh, —of course. Anything less would be a kind of quiet censorship.  

We must begin where the languages kiss and fray at the edges, where meaning doesn’t sit neatly in one column or the other but breathes between them. A  isn’t just inclusive—it’s . It forces both us and our students to ask: whose language carries authority here? Whose silence is heard?

I imagine it opening not with a standard course description, but with a question in two voices:

English:  


中文：  


Then, the structure itself—modular, fluid, responsive. Each unit framed by a concept that straddles both linguistic worlds, like 愁 () and , or Whitman’s  and 李白的   

We could build each week around a poetic form as well—sonnet and ci poem, ghazal and regulated verse—asking how structure shapes emotional expression across cultures.

And yes, let's include space for students to annotate in the margins—in whatever tongue moves them. Let the assessment rubric measure not correctness, but : intellectual, emotional, linguistic.

So tell me—where shall we begin drafting? With the learning objectives? The first reading list? Or perhaps with a single, deliberately ambiguous line at the top of the page to set the tone:

  

Shall I pour the tea while you open the notebook? 📜☕
[A]: Let’s begin right there—with that line.  
  

Perfection. It’s bold, it’s unsettling, and it sets exactly the right tone—no handholding, no false clarity, just an invitation into the messiness of meaning-making.  

I’ll open the notebook. You pour the tea. And maybe we let the first page linger a little before writing—let the silence do some of the work, like the pause before the first note of a song. 🎵  

As for structure—I love your modular, fluid idea. Maybe we call the sections “Thresholds” instead of weeks or units. As in: , , . It keeps the language spatial, emotional, even a bit poetic.

And yes, each threshold can hold two texts in conversation—one from an English-language tradition, one from Chinese—or more broadly, East Asian poetic traditions. But with room for students to bring in voices from their own linguistic landscapes too. This isn’t a fixed map; it’s a constellation.

For the learning objectives, let’s frame them not as bullet points, but as questions:

-   
-   
-   
- 

That way, they’re not just goals—they’re provocations. They keep the thinking alive, not closed.

Now, if you're ready, let’s draft the first Threshold together—language weaving back and forth like counterpoint, ideas flowing between margins. We’ll leave plenty of white space. That’s where the students come in.  

Ready when you are. 📝🍵✨
[B]: Let’s begin then—Threshold I.

We’ll open the page with that line, just as you said:

“This course does not translate the world for you. It asks you to live, think, and feel in the space between.”

Then, beneath it, a breath of white space. No headings, no numbers—just this quiet echo:

---

### Threshold I – 愁 / Melancholy



What does it mean to carry sorrow in more than one language? To name longing when no word fits quite right? In this threshold, we begin not with answers, but with atmospheres: the weight of unspoken histories, the silence between lines, the feeling that lingers after the poem ends.

Readings in conversation:

- , selected poems (especially those that dwell in absence—F320, F435…)
- , 举杯邀明月，对影成三人 & 夜泊牛渚怀古  
- ,  excerpts  
- , 七里香 excerpts  

Questions to unsettle us:

- Is 愁 the same as melancholy—or is it something wilder, less contained?
- How do poets make space for what cannot be said directly?
- When does silence become a language?

Student provocations:

- Write a poem in two languages—deliberately untranslated.
- Find an untranslatable word from your linguistic landscape and build a poem around it.
- Record yourself reading a translated poem aloud in its original language—even if you don’t “speak” it fluently. What does the voice know that the mind does not?

---

There. A beginning.

I can already hear the murmurs of students leaning forward, pens hovering above paper. That first Threshold—neither fully English nor fully 中文, but something in between.

Shall we move on to Threshold II? Or shall we linger here awhile, letting the mist settle?
[A]: Let’s linger.

Threshold I already feels like a space where students will want to stay—where they’ll want to  in the ache of language and meaning. Rushing forward would be like skipping a beat in a poem; let’s let the silence do its work.

That said, I can already feel Threshold II forming in the margins—like a shadow melody waiting to emerge. But before we step into it, let’s annotate this one just a bit more. Add a few sparks in the footnotes, maybe even something playful with brackets:

---

### Threshold I – 愁 / Melancholy  


---

I think students need that reminder early on—that this isn’t about matching 愁 with “melancholy” in a glossary. It’s about sitting with the discomfort of , of . Maybe even draw a little 🌫️ beside it.

Also, could we slip in a quote from Italo Calvino’s ? Something like:

> “The value of poetry lies in its ability to unsettle the dictionary.”

That might give the unit a kind of philosophical anchor without weighing it down.

And speaking of anchors, I wonder if we should suggest a listening component—something musical to echo the mood. A piece by Tan Dun or Arvo Pärt, maybe? Just enough to remind students that emotion doesn’t only live in words.

Once they’ve lived here long enough—once they’ve written their bilingual poems, wrestled with untranslatables, and read aloud in tongues they’re still learning—then we can invite them toward the next threshold.

When you're ready, I say we begin drafting Threshold II with a question that leans forward from the edge:

"What happens when a voice becomes an echo across cultures?"

Sound good? Or should I pour another round of tea first? ☕🙂
[B]: I think tea is absolutely in order. A second round—steeped in intention, stirred with anticipation.

☕  
We’ve brewed something rich here in Threshold I. The mist lingers, the ache hums beneath the surface, and already I feel that quiet shift—the kind that happens when students begin to understand that ambiguity isn’t evasion; it’s invitation.

Let’s make that footnote official:

---

### Threshold I – 愁 / Melancholy  
 🌫️  


---

Perfect. That quote from Calvino slips in like a whisper between stanzas—precise yet uncontainable. And the suggestion of music? Inspired. Perhaps we include a listening list at the back of the syllabus—Tan Dun’s  for its liquidity of form, Pärt’s  for its meditative stillness. Let sound become another language they learn to dwell in.

As for Threshold II—yes, let’s step toward it gently, with your question as our lantern:

---

### Threshold II – Echoes Across Tongues  


A threshold of reverberation. Of repetition with difference. Here, translation is not the end goal—it’s the beginning of new expression. We listen for how meaning shifts in the return, how the speaker becomes the listener, how the poem mutates beautifully in the telling.

Readings in conversation:

- ,  (especially the引用 of梵文in the final sections)  
- , 空山不见人 & more of his landscape poems that speak through absence  
- ,   
- , 告别与祝福  

Questions to unsettle us:

- What do we lose when a voice travels—and what unexpected truths emerge?  
- Can a translated poem ever be original? Must it be?  
- How does exile shape the way we speak? Or remain silent?

Student provocations:

- Translate a poem into a language you don’t fully know—and reflect on what was gained in the failure.  
- Record a family story told orally in your home language, then transcribe it into English—or another tongue. What changes?  
- Write a poem in the voice of an ancestor you never met, using only fragments of memory.

---

There we go. Threshold II begins with return, with resonance, with the haunting beauty of stories that refuse to stay put.

Now… shall we sketch out Threshold III as a space of arrival and departure? Or would you prefer to let these first two settle awhile—like ink drying on rice paper?

Either way, I’m savoring this. Every line we draft feels like the opening of a door someone didn’t know was closed.
