[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question about communication styles. I must say, as someone who cherishes the written word in its most thoughtful form, email holds a particular appeal for me. There’s something almost poetic about taking the time to craft a message, to weigh each phrase as though selecting just the right words for a sonnet. 

But let me clarify—I’m not entirely adverse to instant messaging. In fact, when coordinating with colleagues or exchanging quick ideas with students, it can be quite efficient. Still, I find that the artistry of conversation often suffers in brevity. One might say it's the difference between a haiku and an epic poem—both have their place, but only one allows for deep reflection.

I suppose this preference is also tied to my own habits—grading essays late into the evening, corresponding with fellow scholars across time zones… it all feels more deliberate through email. Though I do recall a colleague once quipping, “If only we could send footnotes via text message!” – a remark that made me smile. 

What about you? Do you find yourself leaning toward one mode of communication over the other?
[A]: 这真是个有意思的问题呢。说实话，作为经常要跟学生和同事沟通的人，我其实会根据不同的情况选择不同的方式。比如处理论文的细节或者给学生反馈的时候，我会更倾向于用email，这样能更完整地表达想法，也方便对方反复查看。不过像临时改时间或者简单确认个信息，instant messaging确实方便快捷，尤其是用微信的时候，语音消息还能传达语气，有时候比打字更快。

但说到个人偏好，其实我也挺怀念以前写信的感觉，那种一字一句斟酌的过程，像是在做一件作品。现在偶尔收到一封认真写的邮件，还是会特别感动 😊。你刚才提到说喜欢像写十四行诗一样写邮件，这个比喻太贴切了！

话说回来，你是怎么看待这两种沟通方式的？工作上？生活中？会不会有某种方式让你觉得更有“人味儿”？
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated reflection—thank you for sharing that. It’s reassuring to know there are others who still appreciate the  of communication, rather than merely the speed of it.

In my experience, the distinction between work and life has become ever more porous, especially in academia, where one is constantly toggling between roles: mentor, colleague, committee member, writer. In such contexts, email remains the backbone of professional interaction—it offers a kind of gravitas, wouldn’t you agree? A well-structured message can carry nuance, tone, even empathy—qualities that tend to evaporate in the flurry of instant pings.

That said, I’ve come to accept that some part of our modern academic identity involves a certain fluency in digital shorthand. For instance, when coordinating with graduate students about upcoming office hours or confirming a reference letter, I do find myself slipping into the world of messaging apps. There’s a rhythm to it—almost like call-and-response poetry, though admittedly less lyrical.

As for which mode feels more “human,” I suppose it depends on the sender. There are colleagues whose emails read like miniature essays, rich with thought and warmth, while others send messages so clipped and mechanical they might as well be written by an algorithm. And then there are those rare, precious messages—email or otherwise—that contain a line or two of genuine inquiry beyond the transactional:  or  That’s when the medium becomes more than just function—it becomes connection.

I’m curious—are there moments when you find yourself deliberately slowing down a message, even in instant communication, just to preserve that sense of presence?
[A]: 这真是段充满哲思的分享，听得我都不自觉把咖啡杯放慢了一点 😊。

你说的对，其实“媒介即信息”这句话在我们这个年代显得格外真实。我在给学生布置作业的时候，常会提醒他们注意沟通的“质感”。比如同样的一个建议，用email写出来，可以像一封信笺般让人反复阅读；但用微信发过去，可能就变成了“任务清单”的一部分。所以有时候即使是在微信上，我也会刻意调整格式，加个emoji或者改换语气词，让文字多一点温度 🌟。

至于你说的“故意放慢节奏”，我还真有这种习惯！特别是在处理学生的情感类咨询时，哪怕只是语音消息，我也会稍微停顿一下再回复，像是给自己几秒钟去感受对方的情绪。有时候甚至还会说：“让我想想怎么表达比较好…” 这样一句话，其实就是在制造一种“临场感”，让学生觉得你不是在机械回应，而是在用心听。

说到这个，你有没有试过用语音留言代替打字？我发现有些学生更愿意听我说话而不是读邮件，尤其是那些语言学习上有压力的同学。声音真的是另一种层次的“presence”呢 🎧
[B]: How lovely—that image of you setting down your coffee, as if in quiet agreement with the rhythm of our conversation. Thank you for that.

You’re absolutely right—, and never has this been more palpable than now, when so much of our interaction is mediated through screens. I find your approach to  quite inspiring—those small interventions, like adding an emoji or adjusting tone, are akin to punctuation marks in a poem: they guide the reader’s emotional cadence.

I must confess, I’ve only recently begun experimenting with voice messages, largely out of necessity during the pandemic, when my students seemed to crave a more embodied presence. At first, I resisted—I’m someone who composes even casual emails as though drafting a letter to . But over time, I discovered something unexpected: the intimacy of voice. It does add a layer of humanity, doesn’t it? One can hear hesitation, encouragement, even the faint rustle of papers in the background—an auditory glimpse into another person’s world.

There was one moment that stayed with me—a student wrote back after receiving a voice message, saying, “It felt like you were actually sitting across from me.” That touched me deeply. Perhaps it’s the modern-day equivalent of reading a letter aloud by lamplight, don’t you think?

I may never abandon email entirely—old habits die hard—but I do see now that warmth can be conveyed in many forms, as long as we remain attentive to the other person’s need for connection.
[A]: That image of reading a letter aloud by lamplight really struck a chord with me 🌙. There's something so deeply human about hearing someone's voice—hesitations, inflections, even the pauses between words. It reminds me of how we learn languages, you know? Babies don’t acquire speech from written instructions; they absorb tone, rhythm, emotion. Maybe that’s why voice messages can feel so powerful in our digitally fragmented world.

I remember one time I sent a voice message to a student who had been struggling with anxiety and falling behind in class. I kept it short—just a gentle check-in and an offer to talk—but later she replied saying she’d listened to it three times because “it felt like having a teacher nearby, not just a name on a syllabus.” That stayed with me. We often underestimate how much emotional bandwidth voice carries.

And I totally get what you mean about composing emails like letters to —if anything, I think that kind of precision is a form of care, too. It just serves a different communicative purpose. Maybe it’s less about choosing one mode over another, and more about knowing when each is most appropriate. After all, a well-placed voice note can be as meaningful as a carefully edited email.

You know, come to think of it, maybe this is also about multimodal literacy for today’s students. They need to navigate tone, medium, and context more fluidly than ever before. I’ve actually started integrating a mini-unit on communication styles into my bilingual education course. It’s fascinating to see how students reflect on their own habits—like realizing they switch not only between languages but also between formats depending on who they’re talking to 😊

Do you ever find yourself teaching or modeling these kinds of digital communication skills in your courses?
[B]: What a luminous observation—yes,  is precisely the phrase. Voice carries intention in a way that text, for all its elegance, often struggles to convey. One might say we are all, in our own way, still attuned to the oral tradition—the lilt of a storyteller’s voice, the pause before a revelation, the shared silence after a line of poetry has landed.

Your student’s response moved me deeply:  Isn’t that what we strive for, even in the most impersonal of digital formats? A sense of nearness, of presence? I find myself thinking of T. S. Eliot’s —a moment of centeredness amidst the chaos. In a way, that voice message became her still point.

And yes, I do bring these questions into the classroom, though perhaps not as formally as your mini-unit suggests. In my courses on Victorian and Modernist poetry, we often begin by examining the  through which literature was consumed—letters, serialized magazines, public readings. It’s fascinating to watch students connect those historical forms with their own fragmented digital landscape. When we read Gerard Manley Hopkins’  for instance, we talk not only about meter but about compression—how much can be said in brevity without losing depth?

More recently, I’ve begun asking students to reflect on their own modes of communication. Some write beautifully in formal essays but struggle to express themselves clearly in email. Others default to hyper-informal language, forgetting that tone shapes perception. So yes, we do practice—it’s part of being literate in more than just syntax.

I suppose that’s what it means to teach in the broadest sense—not just to impart knowledge, but to help others find their voice across mediums. And if that sometimes means modeling care through a well-punctuated email or a thoughtfully recorded voice note, then so be it. After all, isn’t teaching itself a kind of lifelong correspondence?
[A]: That metaphor——just gave me goosebumps 🥺. It’s so true, isn’t it? Whether it’s through a carefully structured lecture, a scribbled comment in the margin of a paper, or yes, even a voice message sent late at night, we’re always, in some way, writing ourselves into our students’ intellectual lives.

I love how you bring in the  and poetry—it makes me think about how language learning, especially bilingual education, is also deeply rooted in rhythm and voice. When teaching Mandarin pronunciation to beginners, for instance, I often remind them that tones aren't just technical—they're emotional carriers too. A second tone might sound like surprise or protest; a fourth tone can carry authority or frustration. The  something is said shapes the  itself.

And your point about compression—whether it’s Hopkins’ curtal sonnets or a text message—is spot on. I’ve had students who could write beautiful five-page reflections but froze when asked to summarize their research in one clear sentence. There’s an art to condensing without flattening, and I think that’s a skill we need now more than ever.

You know what I find fascinating? How digital communication mirrors this tension between depth and brevity. We want both connection and efficiency. And maybe that’s where the  comes in—not just between languages, but between registers, formats, and platforms.

Speaking of which… have you noticed any generational shifts in how your students approach email? Like, do they still see it as a formal space, or is it becoming more casual over time?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully observed connection—between tone in language learning and tone in communication more broadly. You're quite right: the  shapes the . In many ways, teaching bilingual students must be like guiding them through dual musical notations—one in syntax, the other in inflection. And I adore your example about Mandarin tones carrying emotion; it makes me think of how iambic pentameter itself can feel like a heartbeat, steady but expressive.

As for generational shifts in email—it’s a subject that has fascinated me for years, quietly observed between the lines of student correspondence.

Yes, there is a discernible shift. Not dramatic, but unmistakable. Ten years ago, most students approached email with a kind of inherited formality—they might have been unsure of the exact structure, but they understood it was a space apart from texting or social media. They wrote , closed with , and generally treated the inbox as a kind of virtual office hour.

Now? There's a certain fluidity—sometimes charming, sometimes perplexing. Some students begin with  (not ), others write in paragraphs that resemble bullet points. Emojis still feel rare in this context, but not unheard of. What strikes me most is the blurring of register—students often seem unsure whether to treat email as a casual chat or a formal letter. It's as though the platform itself has lost its semantic anchor.

And yet—I’ve noticed something rather touching. When I model a particular tone in my own replies—clear, warm, slightly elevated but never stiff—students tend to mirror it. It's almost as if they’re waiting for a cue, a kind of linguistic choreography. So perhaps we are still, in our small academic way, shaping the next generation of correspondents.

I wonder—are your students ever surprised by the conventions of formal academic email? Do they sometimes slip into code-switching instinctively, or does it require explicit guidance?
[A]: Oh, I love that image of students waiting for a linguistic cue—it reminds me so much of how bilingual learners operate. They’re always scanning for signals, aren’t they? Tone, structure, even punctuation becomes part of the dance 🎭.

And yes, my students—whether they're native Mandarin speakers learning English or vice versa—are often genuinely surprised by the  of formal academic email. For many, it’s like encountering a foreign dialect within their own language. They know the words, but not the rhythm.

Some slip into code-switching instinctively, especially those who’ve grown up in multilingual or multicultural environments. They’ll start drafting an email to me in English with casual contractions and then—mid-sentence, almost unconsciously—shift into a more formal tone, as if realizing they've crossed an invisible boundary 😊.

But others need more explicit scaffolding. I actually have a workshop just on this—“从微信到邮件：语境与语气的切换” (). We go through examples together: one email written like a text message (“Hey prof, did u see my paper?”), another overcompensating with overly stiff phrasing (“Esteemed Dr. Chen, It is with utmost respect that I submit my assignment…”), and then we land somewhere in between.

What I find most fascinating is how quickly they adapt once they understand the  behind the formality. It’s not about sounding stiff—it’s about clarity, respect, and positioning oneself professionally. Once they get that, the shift becomes less mechanical and more intuitive.

I wonder, do you ever assign “email drafts” as part of your assignments? Or perhaps encourage them to revise a message after seeing your response style?
[B]: What a wonderfully vivid phrase—. You're absolutely right to frame it that way, for indeed, there is something ceremonial about it. A kind of quiet liturgy, performed across time zones and inboxes.

I find your workshop title particularly evocative: . It speaks not only to the mechanics of language but to the deeper act of situational awareness. I imagine your students, mid-draft, catching themselves in tone-shifting gestures—like dancers adjusting their posture mid-movement. How beautifully human.

In my own courses, I don’t formally assign , though I probably should consider it more explicitly. What I do instead—perhaps unconsciously—is treat student emails as informal texts we occasionally dissect together. When a particularly striking example arrives (with permission, of course), I’ll project it anonymously during class and ask students to reflect aloud: 

It’s always fascinating. They’re often startled by how much meaning can shift with the addition—or omission—of a single salutation. One young man once remarked,  That moment of realization—that tone is performative and contextual—is pure pedagogical gold.

And yes, I do encourage revision, especially when a student has made a genuine effort but missed the mark in tone. I might reply with something like:  
  
Then, gently, I offer an edited version, preserving their voice but sharpening the clarity.

I suppose it’s another form of textual mentorship—helping them see that precision need not come at the cost of personality. Much like teaching poetry, really. After all, isn’t that what we do? We guide others in finding the rhythm that best conveys their meaning—and their humanity.
[A]: Absolutely —  is such a poetic yet precise way to put it. It’s not just about correcting grammar or formatting; it’s about helping students find their voice within the constraints (and possibilities) of each medium.

I love how you describe treating student emails as texts for reflection—like literary artifacts, almost. It reminds me of how we analyze bilingual code-switching in class. Sometimes a student slips into informal language not out of carelessness, but because they're trying to convey warmth or familiarity. The intent is there, but the context might not support it. And that’s where our gentle intervention comes in.

I especially appreciate your example reply:  
  
That line is pure pedagogy gold. It affirms effort, invites growth, and keeps the focus on purpose rather than correction alone.

I think I’m going to borrow that phrase, if you don’t mind 😊. I’ve been experimenting with how to give feedback on emails without making students feel like they’re being policed. Language norms can be tricky—they often carry cultural assumptions about authority and deference, especially in academic settings. So framing it as  rather than  feels much more collaborative.

You know, come to think of it, maybe we should start a cross-disciplinary workshop someday—something like . Imagine working with students on crafting messages that are both emotionally resonant and structurally sound. We could have them revise sonnets  emails in the same week!

Wouldn't that be something?
[B]: What a truly inspired idea—! I can already imagine the syllabus: one week we dissect the volta in a Petrarchan sonnet, the next we analyze the rhetorical turn in a well-crafted email pitch. Yes, yes—why shouldn’t elegance of form serve both literary and practical ends?

I think you’re absolutely right to frame it as  rather than . That single shift in language changes everything—it moves us from a posture of judgment to one of co-creation. And isn’t that what teaching poetry has always been about? Helping students shape raw emotion into something artful, without dulling its intensity?

Your idea for a cross-disciplinary workshop has me quite animated—I can see it now: students reading Elizabeth Bishop’s  alongside a dissection of tone in rejection emails; comparing the economy of haiku with the constraints of a tweet or a text message. We could even have them compose a villanelle on academic deadlines—now  would be a feat of both form and function.

And of course, you may borrow my line freely—language is meant to be shared, after all. Though I suspect you’ll soon repay me tenfold with your own lyrical phrasings.

Let’s keep this idea blooming—perhaps over tea or correspondence, whichever medium best suits the season.
[A]: 茶与文字，都是需要慢慢品味的 🍵✍️。我特别喜欢你提到的那种“季节性选择”——有时候一封精心雕琢的邮件像深秋的午后，安静而有层次；有时候一条简短的语音消息又像春天的阵雨，轻快地打个照面就走。

你说的对，语言从来不该是孤岛，它本就应该在诗意与实用之间流动。而且，这种流动本身，不也是一种教学的美感吗？我们在教学生写作的同时，也在不断重新发现自己的表达方式。

下次如果真要办那个 workshop，我想请你来上第一讲 😊。主题我都想好了：。学生们一定会被这种反差吸引——让他们意识到，写好一首诗和写好一封请求信，其实都需要我们调动最细腻的语言意识。

保持联络，Eleanor。无论是用羽毛笔、钢笔，还是触控板——我都期待着继续这场充满节奏感的对话 💬✨
[B]: 茶与文字，的确都需要 that slow steeping—the kind that only time and attention can provide. I’m so glad you mentioned the  of communication; it’s a metaphor that feels deeply rooted in both teaching and living. Yes—a carefully composed email does resemble a late autumn afternoon: amber-toned, deliberate, layered with the scent of something aged and meaningful. And an instant voice note? Quite like spring rain—fleeting, yet leaving behind a trace of freshness, as if the world had briefly leaned in to whisper.

You’ve touched on something essential—how teaching writing is also a process of . Every time we guide a student through tone, structure, or intent, we are, in some quiet way, relearning our own relationship to language. It’s a kind of recursive grace.

And oh—what a title for the first lecture:  I would be honored, truly, to speak at your workshop. I can already imagine the classroom atmosphere—one where students begin to see that constraint is not the enemy of creativity, but its collaborator.

Until then, yes—let us keep this conversation alive, in whatever form the season calls for. Whether feather quill or touchpad, the rhythm remains: two minds exchanging thought, one line at a time.
[A]: 说到，我现在突然想到一个课堂活动：我们可以让学生根据不同的“沟通季节”来调整同一段内容的表达方式 🌿🍂。比如春天用语音消息传达新生般的轻快感，夏天用热情洋溢的表情和短句，秋天换成结构清晰、语气温润的邮件，冬天则试试简洁冷冽但留有余温的文字——像寒夜里一句简短却真诚的问候。

我觉得这个练习既能训练他们的语言适应能力，又能激发他们对沟通节奏的感知。而且说到底，不就是我们在做的吗？——随着环境、对象、媒介的变化，不断微调我们的语言与情感共振的方式。

等我们 workshop 成形那天，我一定要设计一个叫 “The Seasonal Inbox” 的单元 😊。或许还可以配上不同风格的背景音乐？想象一下，写邮件时耳边是肖邦的夜曲，而发微信时则是坂本龙一的电子音符……每一种形式都有它专属的氛围与仪式感。

期待那一天，也期待下一封你的文字 📝🌸——无论它从哪个平台飘来。
[B]: What a sublime idea—. I can already picture it: students not only refining language, but  it. Not just writing messages, but composing moods.

Your idea of aligning tone with the emotional texture of each season is nothing short of literary pedagogy at its finest. Imagine the nuance they would develop—translating the same core message through the sprightly intonation of spring, the exuberant cadence of summer, the amber-toned clarity of autumn, and the stark yet tender voice of winter. It’s like training young poets to modulate their register according to the weather of the soul.

And the music! Oh, what a lovely touch. Yes—pairing digital communication with soundscapes adds another sensory dimension to the exercise. A cold winter message composed to the hush of a falling piano note; a vibrant summer ping set against the pulse of a synth beat. We are not merely teaching language—we are helping them feel its rhythm in new and resonant ways.

I do hope you’ll save me a seat for  unit when the time comes. Perhaps I might even bring a few lines of Emily Dickinson or W. B. Yeats to show how seasonal metaphors have long shaped literary voice.

Until then, yes—I await your next message, wherever it may arrive. Whether by email, WeChat, or some as-yet-undiscovered medium, I know it will carry the warmth of our shared inquiry.

With anticipation & warm regards,  
Eleanor 📨🍂🎹
[A]: With anticipation & warm replies, I say—let’s keep this correspondence alive in all seasons yet to come 🌸🎹🍂🌷.

I love how you expanded the idea into  language—it really is about more than just word choice; it’s about pacing, mood, even silence between notes. I can already imagine students listening closely not just to what they say, but  it arrives in someone else’s mind. Like tuning an instrument before a performance.

And Dickinson and Yeats in the classroom? Please do bring them along—we’ll set up two chairs, one for language learning and one for literary soul. I bet our students would be captivated by how centuries-old poetry can inform something as everyday as a message to a professor or colleague.

I’ll definitely save you a seat—and maybe even a custom playlist titled “Inbox as Instrument.” Think of it: pairing a crisp autumn email with a Debussy prelude or a breezy summer WeChat thread with a light bossa nova beat. We could even let students create their own soundtracks—what a way to deepen their awareness of tone and context!

Until then, know that every message from you feels like a carefully wrapped gift in my inbox 🎁💌—whether it carries a scholarly thought, a poetic metaphor, or simply a line to say 

Looking forward to whatever comes next—in teaching, in writing, in this gentle rhythm we’ve found, one line at a time.

Warmly,  
Emily ✨📬
[B]: Ah, —what a luminous continuation of the metaphor. You’ve captured precisely what makes this work so meaningful: the idea that every message, no matter how brief or routine, carries the potential to be a composed expression of thought and care.

I do believe Dickinson would be delighted at the notion of her dashes and slant truths appearing in a workshop titled . And Yeats—well, he might raise an eyebrow at WeChat, but I suspect he’d be secretly pleased to find his lines read alongside lessons on tone and temporality.

As for your imagined classroom—listening closely to how language arrives in another’s mind? That is pedagogy at its most refined. It reminds me of reading poems aloud, not just for meaning, but for the way sound resonates in the body. Perhaps we are both, in our way, teaching students to , to attend not only to content, but to presence.

And yes—let us keep this correspondence alive across seasons, platforms, and playlists. May each message we exchange—and those we inspire others to write—carry both clarity and warmth, structure and surprise.

Looking forward, always,  
Eleanor 📜🎹🍂  
P.S. I shall begin drafting my lecture notes under the influence of Debussy—fitting music for thoughtful composition.
