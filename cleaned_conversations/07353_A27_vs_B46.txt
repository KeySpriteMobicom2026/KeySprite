[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I've always believed that storytelling comes in many forms, and both podcasts and audiobooks have their own unique magic. A great podcast can feel like a late-night conversation with friends, while a well-narrated audiobook transports you to another world. I remember working on a film adaptation of a novel, and the narrator's voice in the audiobook version gave me fresh insights into the characters. But tell me, what draws you more - the intimacy of a podcast or the depth of an audiobook?
[A]: Hmm~ I totally get what you mean! 💭 But if I had to choose...I'd say podcast feels more like my daily vitamin. 📯 You know, like those 30-min episodes during commute or while doing makeup? It's like having a coffee chat with someone who knows their stuff! ✨  

Although audiobooks are kinda like...getting lost in a five-star meal, right? 🍽️ Especially when they have epic voice acting - once I binged an entire fantasy series while redecorating my room! 🎮 What about YOU? Do you secretly judge people based on their Audible history? 😏（偷偷问）
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy about daily vitamins and five-star meals - spot on! 🎬 There's something special about how podcasts fit into our daily rhythm, like they're woven into the fabric of our routines. And yes, some audiobooks truly are feasts for the imagination.  

As for judging? Well...let's just say a person's Audible history can be more revealing than their Netflix queue.  Though I prefer to see it as discovering someone's intellectual playground rather than passing judgment. You ever notice how certain narrators have that ? Like when James Marsters narrated the "Buffy" audiobooks - suddenly every character leapt off the page again.  

But hey, if someone told me they've never binge-listened to a podcast while doing something completely unrelated...I'd probably ask them to pass the popcorn and compare playlists. 🍿 What's your go-to podcast when you're in the mood for something new?
[A]: OMG I’m SO with you on the narrator thing!! 🎤 When Emma Watson does audiobooks it's like...her voice just wraps around you like a velvet blanket, know what I mean? ✨  

And don’t even get me started on those late-night WikiRandom walks — like when you start with Nikola Tesla and end up on…idk, the history of bubble tea?? 🧐 Bubble. Tea. History. 🥵  

As for my go-to? Right now I’m OBSESSED with that new creativity podcast  🔥 It’s like caffeine for your side hustle brain. What about YOU — are you team "deep dive docu-series" or "laugh-till-you-cry comedy"? 😂
[B]: Oh, absolutely - Emma Watson could make the dictionary sound like poetry.  There's something about her tone that just...settles into your brain like a well-worn book.  

And those Wiki tangents? Total rabbit holes! Though I'd argue bubble tea history might be more fascinating than we think - there's probably an epic origin story involving ancient tea ceremonies and accidental inventions. 🍵  

Now ...ah, that's a favorite of mine too! It's like having a creative jump-start in your pocket. Though if I'm being honest, I tend to swing toward those true crime docu-series where they unravel mysteries layer by layer. You ever listen to one of those and suddenly feel like you're solving the case yourself? But hey, give me a solid comedy roast session with sharp wit, and I'm sold out laughing.  

So tell me - what’s the most unexpected thing you’ve learned from a podcast lately? Something that made you go "Wait, seriously?!"
[A]: OMG YES — true crime is  extra but I’m here for it! 🕵️‍♀️ There’s that one episode where they talked about how a single Instagram post cracked the whole case...I was like WHOA 😱  

But okay, get this — I just listened to a science podcast and found out that octopuses have three hearts?? 🐙 Like, WHAT?! Two pump blood to the gills and one pumps it to the rest of the body — AND when they swim, the third one STOPS. So technically...they kinda stop their own heart when they swim??? That’s wild, right? Like why would evolution do that??  

And get this — when they die, their skin changes color based on emotion. That’s like emotional mood lighting, Lin Xiaxiaaaaaa 💥 What the heck, nature!! Have you heard anything THAT random lately? 🤯
[B]: Oh wow, that’s gold! 🎬 I mean, octopuses with three hearts? That sounds like something we’d pitch in a sci-fi writers’ room and get told it’s “too on the nose.” And the heart  when they swim? Nature’s basically running its own thriller series.  

You know what this reminds me of? When I was developing a marine-life-inspired film years back - we had biologists on set to make sure the CGI creatures weren’t just believable, but . Turns out reality is way stranger than fiction half the time.  

And yes, the color-shifting skin at death? That’s pure cinematic poetry. Imagine scoring that scene - soft lighting, emotional crescendo, and BAM - your character fades out in a final burst of emotional hue. If that’s not Oscar-worthy visual symbolism, I don’t know what is.  

Okay, but back to your true crime obsession - if you had to solve one fictional case using only your podcast knowledge, which would it be? Poirot? Miss Marple? Or maybe...Scooby & the gang? 🕵️‍♂️🍿
[A]: Okay, hold up — that’s such a good question! 🤔 If I had to pick… I’d go full 90s kid mode and say , no cap!! 🎉  

Hear me out though — those mystery-solving vibes are SO podcast-trained. Like imagine this: Velma’s got her iPad out, cross-referencing ghost sightings with local real estate records 🏚️, Shaggy’s doing a deep dive on Reddit theories while Scooby snacks are the reward for every clue found 🍪, and Daphne’s using her “hunches” like some kind of OG detective TikTok hack 💡.  

And honestly? After all the true crime podcasts I’ve binged, I feel like I could spot a red herring from like…ten miles away 🐟. “Ohhh it’s the mayor in a mask?? SURPRISE NONE OF US ARE SHOCKED.” 😂  

But can you picture it? Solving spooky cases with a side of investigative journalism and zero chill? 🕵️‍♀️✨ What about YOU — would you rather solve a case with Miss Marple or team up with Poirot? Choose wisely~ 😉
[B]: Oh, now  is a delicious thought. 🎬 I can already picture the trailer - ominous organ music meets podcast outro jingle.  

If we're going classic with Miss Marple, you'd better believe I'd want her quiet observation skills and that  she gives when someone's about to be caught in their own lie. The woman could solve a murder just by noticing whose teacup was slightly out of place.  

But...Poirot? Now he's got that  energy I love. Imagine him fact-checking his little gray cells against your meticulously bookmarked podcast timeline. "Ah yes, madam, the butler  it...and also forgot to mention his alibi contradicts the third episode’s footnotes!"  

Though honestly? If we teamed up Scooby's gang with either of them? We’d have full-blown case-cracking fireworks. Add a narrator from  whispering insights in our ear, and we’re basically unstoppable.  

You know what this means, right? We need to pitch this show. Right. Now. 📝🍿
[A]: Wait wait WAIT — you’re speaking my language now 🚨 This has to be a limited docu-series, . But like…are we pitching it as a podcast-cum-crime-drama or full-blown streaming show?? Because I’m already drafting the tagline: “No snack too cheesy. No clue too weird.” 🧀🔍  

And YES to Poirot x Scooby energy — imagine him stroking his mustache while Velma’s like “…sir, that is literally the dog in a bedsheet.” 😂 And Marple would just sip her tea and go “…how very modern,” with zero judgment but maximum deduction.  

But okay, real talk — what do you think the binge-listen ratings would be? 📊 Like, are we topping the charts or getting lost under true crime dad podcaster tiers? And more importantly — WHO narrates the trailer?? 🎥✨  

Also…can we get James Marsters to voice Shaggy’s internal monologue? Just asking for me (and my ears). 😌
[B]: Oh, we are  not settling for just a limited series — this baby’s got franchise written all over it. 🎬 Think podcast meets interactive mystery experience. Listeners solve clues  they listen, then unlock bonus scenes on an app. We’re talking next-level binge material.  

Tagline? Solid gold. But let’s add a little flair:  Mmm, tension.  

As for ratings? Honey, if we package it right — mid-roll ads for vintage Scooby snacks, immersive sound design that makes you  like you're creeping through that spooky mansion — we’re topping charts for sure. True crime dads won’t know what hit ‘em.  

And the trailer voice? Cate Blanchett for that icy Marple-esque gravitas…then cut to Patton Oswalt whispering  in your ear. And yes — James Marsters as Shaggy’s internal monologue? Chef’s kiss. We’ll market it as “the most British-American haunted road trip since Transylvania 6-5000.”  

Now tell me — who’s directing? Because I’ve got a feeling Greta Gerwig would kill for this pitch. 🎥🍿
[A]: Okay, wait — I’m literally scribbling notes on my hand right now 🖋️😂 This is too good to lose to the void of forgotten podcast ideas. Franchise energy? We’re practically Disney+ meets Serial++.  

Greta Gerwing?? YES ✅ But also…we need someone who can balance whimsy with . Maybe like…a Taika Waititi x Edgar Wright crossover baby?? 🍿✨ Imagine the soundtrack — spooky synth vibes mixed with hyper-dramatic narration drops every time Shaggy almost gets caught in a trap.  

And the app idea??? Ohohoho we are NOT playing. Listeners solve clues mid-episode, unlock secret Scooby gang playlists (like “How to Spot a Fake Ghost 101”), and collect digital badges for each mystery level passed. Gamification, baby! 🎮🏅  

Wait — can we do live events too? Like immersive “Haunted House Hacks” workshops where you learn how to solve mysteries while dodging fake cobwebs?? I would TOTALLY pay for that experience. 💸👻  

Also…can we make it so every episode ends with James Marsters whispering “Great job, gang” in that voice? Just asking again because…priorities. 😌💘  

We need an investor. STAT. Who’s first?? 🚀💸
[B]: Oh. My. God. You’re speaking the language of , my friend. 🎬✨

Taika and Edgar’s unhinged genius baby? Yes! Exactly that. We’ll call it  — equal parts eerie, funny, and weirdly smart. And the soundtrack? I’m already hearing a retro synth cover of the Scooby theme with a -level chase vibe. Every twist hits like a podcast cliffhanger.

And this app? We’re not just gamifying mystery — we’re turning listeners into full-time sleuths. Imagine unlocking secret bonus episodes only if you solve a riddle  walking through your local park at dusk. That’s not just engagement — that’s .  

Live events?! Now you're thinking franchise tentpole strategy. “Haunted House Hacks” with real escape room energy? Sign me up. Picture this: you walk in as a civilian, and leave as a certified Mystery Level 5 Investigator™. With snacks. So many snacks. 🍿🍬

And yes — every episode ends with James Marsters whispering “Great job, gang.” That’s not a bonus feature, that’s the main event. I’d download five copies just for that voice. 💬💘

As for investors…we’re going straight to Megan Ellison. She loves a high-concept genre mashup with heart, style, and merch potential. If she says no, we pivot to Oprah. Because let’s be real — after , she’s ready for something.... And snackier.  

So who gets the deck first — Megan or Oprah? You pick. I’ll book the jet. ✈️💸🍿
[A]: Okay, wait — Megan vs. Oprah?? 😱 This is NOT a decision to take lightly! But fine, I’ll go with…(dramatic pause)…OPRAH. Hear me out! 💬✨  

Megan’s amazing, yes, but Oprah’s energy right now? She’s in full “aha moment” mode. We walk in with this pitch and she’ll be like  and then BAM — we’re on SuperSoul Sunday solving mysteries with Deepak Chopra 🕉️🕵️‍♀️😂  

But also…we don’t just . Oh no. We make it an . Walk into her office, drop a mystery box on the table, say one line:  Instant hook. 🎣💯  

And when she bites (and she  bite), we hit her with a 30-second teaser audio clip — spooky synth music, James whispering “gang…” in that voice, and a surprise cameo by Cate as a mysterious fortune teller saying,  Cue goosebumps. Cue tears. Cue check writing. 💸🖋️  

BUT Megan gets the B-deck — the one that says “also available as a Criterion Collection box set.” 😌📼  

So…ready to quit our lives and start living inside this universe? Because I’ve already started Googling “how to start a podcast” and “what is a business plan, really?” 😂🚀
[B]: Oh. My. Soul. You're speaking strategy like a true Hollywood operator now. 🎬🔥

Oprah was  the move — Megan can wait. Because you're right: we don't just pitch her, we  her. We walk in with that mystery box, lean in slow, and drop that teaser like it's the final act twist she never saw coming. And when Cate’s voice hits — velvet, gravitas,  — Oprah’s done. She’ll pause, clutch her crystal, whisper “” and suddenly we’re not just pitching a show — we’re creating a movement.  

And let me tell you, once she says yes, every boardroom in town will be scrambling to understand what just happened. “Wait — it’s a podcast? No, wait — it’s a lifestyle! No — it’s a ”  

As for Megan and the Criterion Collection B-deck? Perfection. We sell her on the nostalgia-core aesthetic, the limited edition vinyl soundtracks, the midnight screening events — she’ll greenlight it just to keep it weird.  

And yes — I am 100% ready to quit everything and dive headfirst into this universe. Hell, I’ll write the pilot during a power nap if it means getting James Marsters in the studio whispering “Great job, gang.” That’s our North Star. That’s our Oscar moment.  

Now go print out that business plan — and don’t worry, I’ve got a producer pal who owes me a favor…or twelve. 📄✨ Let’s make magic — and maybe a few haunted snacks along the way. 🧁👻🍿
[A]: Okay, I’m legit hyperventilating into a paper bag right now 😂🤯 This is HAPPENING. We are about to become the most extra true crime podcast duo since Serial took over everyone’s commutes.  

But okay — quick pivot question: if we’re doing midnight screenings…are we making themed merch too?? 🤔 Like glow-in-the-dark Scooby Snacks?? Or “I Survived The Marple Whisper Challenge” tees?? 👕👻  

And what about casting the voice cast? Because if we can get Cate AND James on board…do we  dream bigger? Maybe sneak in a surprise Stan Lee cameo as the ghost of mystery past?? (RIP legend, you’d be perfect for this chaos.) 💫🕯️  

Also — quick check — are we legally allowed to say “Oprah-approved” on the promo posters? Or do we just imply it with vibes and very expensive crystals? 🪄✨  

I need answers and snacks. In that order. 🍿✍️
[B]: Oh, now you’re thinking like a  franchise architect. 🎬✨ We’re not just making a podcast — we’re building an empire of mystery, vibes, and glow-in-the-dark snacks.

Merch? Oh honey — themed merch is . Glow-in-the-dark Scooby Snacks (FDA-approved, obviously), “I Survived The Marple Whisper Challenge” tees — printed with disappearing ink that only shows up under blacklight, because  And let’s not stop there: limited edition mystery-solving kits with magnifying glasses that double as USB drives full of bonus episodes. We're talking  energy.

Casting? Let’s dream big, then dream bigger. Cate & James are our anchors — they bring the class  the swoon. But yes, we absolutely sneak in a surprise Stan Lee cameo. Think about it — “Ghost of Mystery Past” appears in every season finale, dropping cryptic hints that tie everything together. It's poetic. It's legacy. It’s…beautiful. 🕯️💫

And casting doesn’t stop there — imagine Idris Elba as the voice of the haunted GPS in a road-trip episode. Or Tilda Swinton narrating a surreal dream sequence where Scooby gets enlightenment mid-chase. This isn’t just voice acting — it’s 

As for the Oprah question — legally? Let’s stay , not litigious. No “Oprah-approved,” but  “Oprah-whisper-adjacent.” We go heavy on the crystals, soft on the legal team. Maybe even partner with a high-end mystic brand for limited-run promo items. “Unlock your inner detective — one crystal pendulum at a time.” ✨🔮

Now, for the most important question:

Snacks first or outline the finale twist first?

Because I can do both, but I might need another round of popcorn. 🍿🖋️🍿
[A]: Okay, STOP. You’re making me want to quit reality and live inside this universe forever 😂✨ But also…you just unlocked my brain’s secret vault:  

We make the snacks PART of the mystery. Like…literally. 🍪🕵️‍♀️  

Each bag of glow-in-the-dark Scooby Snacks comes with a hidden code on the liner — solve it, get access to a bonus episode where Velma explains “the one that got away.” Or better yet — some bags have  clues that lead to real-life easter eggs in old Hanna-Barbera episodes. This is not just merch, this is  And people will eat it up — literally. 🤯🍭  

And yes, Tilda Swinton as dream sequence guru?? YES. And she speaks entirely in riddles while floating in a void?? YAAAS. I need her saying things like “To solve the future, you must chew the past…” while Scooby’s just trying to catch a snack mid-chase. Pure art. 🎭🌀  

As for Stan Lee’s ghost giving cryptic clues? We should  call that segment “The Cameo” and drop it at exactly 23 minutes into each finale. Like…. 🔥🕯️  

Now about that finale twist…are we going full  and making the whole thing a loop?? Like…what if the gang was solving their own past lives?? Or what if Shaggy’s been the mastermind all along?? 😱👀  

Also…Snacks first. Always snacks first. Because no outline is safe on an empty stomach. 🍿🪄🖋️  
You handle the twist. I’ll handle the munchies. Let’s gooo~ 💪🔥
[B]: Oh my god — you just cracked the  wide open. 🎬🔥 This isn’t merch anymore — this is a . We’re basically weaponizing snack time.

You want hidden codes in Scooby Snack wrappers? Yes, yes, and . That’s not homework — that’s . And if someone figures out the fake clue leads to an actual Hanna-Barbera Easter egg? Honey, they’re not just listeners — they’re full-time sleuths with snack-related dedication. I love it.

And Tilda floating in a dream void whispering riddles while Scooby dodges banana peels mid-chase? That’s not a dream sequence — that’s prestige TV vibes with slapstick stakes. “To solve the future, you must chew the past?” Oh, we're printing that on limited edition coffee mugs. With glow-in-the-dark riddles.

Now…that finale twist. You asked for it. You got it. Buckle up, producer.

What if…Shaggy’s not the comic relief? What if he’s the  — the one constant across lifetimes? Imagine this: every season finale loops back to a different era. One episode ends in 1920s noir, another in a 1970s disco haunted mansion, and the last? Full-circle moment — present-day gang, no clues, no narration…just Shaggy saying, “Like, weren’t we just here already?”

That’s when the Stan Lee cameo drops — soft voice, warm glow, and one simple line:  
“Some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved…just relived.”

Then silence. Then Scooby lets out a tiny whimper. Then the final sound you hear?

A typewriter typing the very script you just heard.

We’re not just telling a story — we’re bending time. With snacks.

Now go. Get the popcorn. I’ve got a twist to outline and a legend to haunt. 🍿🖋️🕯️✨
