[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question - though I must confess my academic biases show when discussing 'modern' versus 'classical'. You see, I've spent three decades analyzing how the 19th century serves as the perfect bridge between classical traditions and modern experimentation. The Pre-Raphaelites' deliberate archaism, for instance, or Li Bai's influence on the Imagists...
[A]: Oh my, you're making me think of the delicate brushstrokes in 18th century French silk paintings. The way those artists layered their colors reminds me so much of the restoration techniques I use on antique tapestries. Modern art has its place, but nothing compares to the craftsmanship of classical textile arts.
[B]: How fascinating that you mention textile arts! This reminds me of the parallel development between European tapestry techniques and Chinese 缂丝 (kesi) silk weaving during the Qing dynasty. The materiality of classical art forms does indeed demand a certain... shall we say, 工匠精神 (craftsman's spirit) that often feels diluted in contemporary practice.
[A]: I do admire the precision in kesi weaving, though I must say I prefer working with European brocades from the same period. The way the gold threads catch the light during restoration... it's simply magical. Modern textile art can be innovative, but it rarely achieves that same luminous quality.
[B]: Precisely! That interplay of light reminds me of John Ruskin's writings on Venetian glass mosaics - how he described them as 'frozen sunlight'. Though I suppose we mustn't dismiss contemporary artists like Anish Kapoor too quickly; his use of pigment does create rather striking... but no, you're quite right about the irreplaceable alchemy of pre-industrial materials.
[A]: You've reminded me of a particularly stubborn stain I once removed from a 17th century Flemish tapestry - the way the original wool dyes maintained their vibrancy after all those years. Modern synthetic fibers simply don't age with the same grace. Though I must admit, contemporary conservation methods do help preserve these treasures for future generations.
[B]: Ah, now there's the essential paradox - we employ modern science to safeguard classical artistry. Much like how I use spectral imaging to study water damage in my first edition of 'Dream of the Red Chamber', while still writing marginalia with my 19th century 狼毫 (wolf hair) brush. The tools may evolve, but the reverence for material history remains.
[A]: How lovely that you mention marginalia - I often find myself making similar notes in my textile pattern books. There's something so intimate about handwritten annotations, isn't there? Though I do wish modern conservators would use proper iron gall ink rather than those dreadful archival markers. The old ways truly were more elegant.
[B]:  Elegant, yes, though I'd argue dangerously acidic in the long term - much like Byron's famously corrosive wit. Still, I do keep a bottle of traditional 松烟墨 (pine soot ink) in my desk for... shall we say, ceremonial purposes. One must maintain certain standards, even in this age of polymer stabilizers and pH-neutral adhesives.
[A]: Indeed, standards must be upheld. Why, just last week I turned down a commission to restore a 'vintage' 1980s polyester quilt. Some things simply aren't worth compromising one's principles for, no matter how much they offer to pay. Now, a genuine 18th century crewelwork bed hanging... that's another matter entirely.
[B]: How very Ruskinian of you - that steadfast refusal to 'sacrifice permanence to pace', as he put it. Though I must confess, I did once examine a particularly fascinating postmodern textile piece that referenced 顾绣 (Gu embroidery) techniques... but no, you're absolutely right. There's no substitute for the weight of history in one's hands. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my 1890s carriage clock chiming - time for my afternoon 铁观音 (Tieguanyin) tea ritual.
[A]: How perfectly timed - I was just about to put the kettle on for my Earl Grey. Though I must say, I do miss the proper tea services we used to have before everyone switched to those dreadful electric kettles. The whistle of a copper kettle on a hob... that's a sound worth preserving, much like our beloved textiles.
[B]: Quite so - though I'd argue even your Earl Grey represents a rather... shall we say, colonial adaptation of classical Chinese tea culture. But then, isn't that the essence of our work? Preserving traditions while acknowledging their inevitable transformations. Now if you'll pardon me, my 紫砂壶 (zisha teapot) is reaching precisely 85 degrees Celsius.
[A]: You're absolutely right about transformations - why, I still remember the shock when I first saw a 'distressed' modern fabric meant to mimic antique damask. It lacked all the character of genuine age. But I suppose we must make our peace with such things, just as I've learned to tolerate tea bags... though never in my workshop. Only proper loose leaf will do when examining textiles.
[B]: Ah, there's the rub - we become curators of authenticity in an age of facsimiles. Though I must share that my graduate students recently presented me with a 'distressed' notebook claiming to replicate my beloved 19th century stationery... I thanked them through gritted teeth while mentally composing a lecture on Walter Benjamin's 'aura of authenticity'. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe we've both got beverages waiting that demand proper attention.
[A]: Indeed we do. And may I say, this has been one of the most stimulating conversations I've had in quite some time. Do feel free to stop by my studio if you're ever in need of proper tea and textile talk. I'll be the one muttering about synthetic dyes while polishing my magnifying glasses. Good day to you.
[B]: And to you - though I suspect we'll continue this dialogue in footnotes and marginalia for years to come. Do watch for my forthcoming article 'Silk Roads and Tea Stains: Materiality in Cross-Cultural Conservation'. I'll be sure to cite your... ahem... passionate defense of loose leaf propriety. 再会 (zaihui).
[A]: Oh, I shall look forward to reading it with great interest - perhaps while sipping properly brewed tea from my grandmother's bone china. Though I must warn you, if I spot any references to those dreadful tea bags, I shall be compelled to write a very strongly worded letter... in proper ink, of course. Farewell for now.
[B]:  Rest assured, my dear colleague - any correspondence from you written in proper iron gall would be framed alongside my first edition of 'The Stones of Venice'. Until then, may your textiles remain authentically frayed and your tea leaves never find themselves imprisoned in gauze. 后会有期 (houhui youqi).
