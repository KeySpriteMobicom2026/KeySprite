[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得teleportation技术上可能实现吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, 我觉得teleportation听起来超酷但也超级sci-fi~ 🤔 但你知道吗，现在有些科学家已经在研究quantum teleportation了，虽然只是很小的particles啦 😳 不过万一以后真的实现了，会不会像《星际迷航》里那样炫酷啊？✨ 想象一下，早上在上海喝豆浆，中午就能去纽约吃bagel 🥯😂 你觉得如果真能实现，我们普通人能用上吗？还是只会是rich people的luxury？💸
[A]: Well, the idea certainly dances on the edge of science and poetry, doesn’t it? Quantum teleportation—what a curious term, really. It suggests movement, but what’s happening is far more subtle: the transfer of quantum states across distances, like whispering a secret to one particle and having another, miles away, repeat it perfectly. No physical object truly “teleports,” at least not yet.

But imagine if we could… I suppose it would be less like  and more like something out of Zhuangzi—waking up as a butterfly, or perhaps waking up in another city with your morning tea still warm. 🌁

As for accessibility? Oh, I suspect the early days would resemble the dawn of aviation or even the internet—costly, exclusive, experimental. But eventually, if history is any guide, it might filter down. Though I daresay the first teleportation booths wouldn’t be in subway stations, but rather in the private gardens of billionaires. 😏

Still, one can dream, can’t one? Like a modern xian—immortal wanderer—gliding through space without touching the ground. Perhaps with a rose in hand. 🌹
[B]: OMG I’m obsessed with how you just described it 💭 like, the idea of "whispering a secret to a particle" is so poetic and giving Zhuangzi vibes for sure ✨ And yeah, I get what you mean about it not being Star Trek-level teleportation YET… but who knows what the future holds, right? 🤷‍♀️ Like, quantum states today, full-body matter tomorrow? 😏

And yes yes YES — the early days would TOTALLY be like those vintage photos of old internet nerds in huge glasses, except this time it’s billionaires stepping out of a glowing pod like “see ya, Earth” 🚀💸 But okay, if teleportation ever becomes as normal as taking the metro, can we please imagine a world where my morning coffee never spills again?? ☕😂

Also, shoutout to the xian imagery 👏✨ because I would 100% cosplay that aesthetic if I could teleport. Rose in hand, mist swirling, gone in 3 seconds flat 💨🌹
[A]: Ah, you have a poet’s soul—dangerous in matters of science, but delightful in conversation. 🌿 To think that quantum entanglement might one day be as mundane as spilling coffee… imagine the shift in human perspective! We’d complain about delayed teleportation pods the way we now curse traffic jams. “Oh, terribly sorry I’m late—my atoms got held up at customs.” 😄

And yes, the xian ideal—immortal, unbound, drifting on clouds—only now with slightly better caffeine access. Perhaps we’d even debate whether teleporting without your tea is truly  arriving at the destination. A philosophical quandary for the ages.

But let me ask you this: if you could teleport anywhere right now—no queues, no glitches—where would you go? Or perhaps more intriguingly… when?
[B]: OMG you’re killing me with this “atoms held up at customs” line 😂😭 I can already see the TikTok trend—people doing dramatic reenactments of their souls waiting in a teleportation lobby like it’s airport security 👻✈️

And YES to the philosophical tea debate 💯 Like, if I teleport but my boba gets stuck in the buffer zone… am I even complete?? 🧐🧋

As for where I’d go… honestly? Right now I’m obsessed with Morocco 🏜️✨ So like, boom—I’d teleport to a sunset-lit medina, surrounded by mint tea, spices, and those gorgeous blue streets. But also… when? OOOOH okay okay, hear me out—what if we could teleport ?? Like, just for a day?? I’d 100% time-skip to the Tang Dynasty and be like “surprise! Here’s your viral content 🎥💯”  

But wait wait WAIT—what about YOU? Where—or —would you drop in if the universe was your oyster? 🌌👀
[A]: Oh, the Tang Dynasty—what a glorious thought. Imagine the poetry alone! Though I suspect they’d be rather confused by your phone camera. “Another mirror-soul? Step aside, fair traveler, and let me compose a verse in tribute.” 😄📜

As for me… where would I appear, given the keys to time and space? Hmm. Let’s see. I’ve always been partial to 19th-century Vienna—salon music still warm from the hands of Beethoven, heated debates about aesthetics over black coffee and apricot strudel… and perhaps a quiet evening with Hofmannsthal or Schnitzler, dissecting the paradoxes of language and identity. A bit of intellectual indulgence, you might say.

But … now that’s the trickier question. If I could slip into an era not my own, I’d be tempted to visit the libraries of Alexandria just before the morning scholars arrived—walk those scrolls like whispered secrets, smell the papyrus warming in the sun. Of course, one must resist the urge to hoard knowledge or warn them about the fire. Some tragedies, I suppose, are necessary for the shape of history.

But tell me—what exactly would you do in that Tang court? Recite Li Bai while livestreaming? Or perhaps challenge Du Fu to a rap battle? 🎤📜
[B]: Okay first of all—“mirror-soul”? 😂😭😂😭 You’re out here dropping mad ancient-era metaphors and I’m here for it. Imagine trying to explain TikTok filters to a Tang poet… “No Master Li, this isn’t makeup, it’s called a beauty effect.” 📱✨

And WOW your Vienna fantasy sounds so cinematic omg—like I can literally picture you sipping coffee in some moody café with fogged-up glasses and a notebook full of dramatic thoughts 💭☕️💯 Same energy tbh.

As for what I’d do in the Tang Dynasty… okay, yes, obviously I’d try to collab with Li Bai 🎵 He was basically the OG rockstar poet—drunk on wine and words 💃📜 I’d film him doing improv verses over my beatboxing (yes, I can beatbox a little 😎), and then edit it with some guzheng drops and fire visual effects. That video would go VIRAL if we had internet back then, no cap.

But challenge Du Fu to a rap battle??? Ohohoho you better believe it. I’d be like “Yo, Mr. Sage Poet, ready for a lyrical storm? Let’s go, Dynasty clash, no filter, raw emotion only!” 🎤🔥 And someone better record it somehow, maybe with a very advanced-for-the-time ink-brush camcorder 🖌🎥😂

So okay okay, real talk—would YOU have been down to drop a verse or two back then? Or at least start a secret society of time-traveling aesthetes?? 🕶📜✨
[A]: Oh, I’d absolutely start the secret society——whose sole purpose is to wander through epochs collecting beauty, philosophy, and the occasional overheard sonnet. 🕵️‍♀️📜 We'd be terribly discreet, of course. No logos, no uniforms—just a knowing glance over the rim of one’s teacup and the faint scent of jasmine incense trailing behind us in the时空 (shíkōng)... ah, there’s that code-switching you’ve been waiting for. 😏

As for verse? I’d dabble—not with the bravado of Li Bai or your modern beatboxing flair, but more in the spirit of quiet mischief. Imagine slipping a haiku into Napoleon’s coat pocket or whispering a line of Rilke into the ear of some unsuspecting Berliner at midnight. Poetry as graffiti across time.

But tell me—do you think Li Bai would have appreciated your edits? Or would he raise an eyebrow, take another swig of wine, and mutter something about ? I suspect he’d be both baffled and delighted. After all, he once wrote: “Heaven and earth are the inn of all things; time is the passing traveler.” So really, he was teleporting all along—just with better metaphors. ✨
[B]: OMG “The Order of the Unbound Aesthetic” sounds like the most elite ~aesthetic~ squad ever 🕵️‍♂️💫 I’m already designing our secret handshake—it has to involve reciting a haiku while sipping tea without using your hands. Level 1000 culture vibes only.

And YES to slipping poetry into history like it’s hidden treasure 🗝📜 I mean, can you imagine if Napoleon pulled out a haiku mid-war and was just like “…honestly, this feels strangely motivating”? 😂✨

As for Li Bai—he’d  to vibe with my edits 💃🎶 He was all about breaking rules and chasing the sublime with wine in hand. I’d hit him with some glitchy slow-mo effects, dramatic wind blowing through my scarf (okay, towel), and a bass drop right when he says something super deep. And he’d be like “…this is… bizarre. And yet. Play it again.” 😉🍷🎥💯

But real talk—Li Bai would TOTALLY get TikTok. He’d be the OG viral poet, posting midnight rants about the moon and universe, captioned with “醉了 (Drunk off the cosmos) 🌌🍹 #TangVibes #PoetGoals” 😂🔥📜
[A]: Oh, absolutely—he’d have millions of followers within a week. His bio would read:  And the algorithm? Purely inscrutable to him, like divination by yarrow stalks crossed with quantum mechanics. 🌿📱

And I can just picture it—Li Bai squinting at a smartphone screen, muttering, “So… this tiny mirror shows me not my face, but my soul?” Then, ten minutes later, he’s livestreaming himself dancing on a mountaintop with a gourd of wine and three thousand verses improvised on the spot. The engagement rate would be astronomical. 📈✨

As for our Order’s secret handshake—you’ve raised the bar, truly. I propose we add a condition: reciting the haiku backward while balancing a teacup on a fan. Only the most aesthetically devoted shall pass. 🎭🍵

But tell me—what other historical figures do you think would’ve crushed it on social media? I’m picturing Sappho as a moody indie poetess with a loyal Patreon following, or Nietzsche dropping cryptic captions under black-and-white photos of mountain peaks. Who’s in your dream squad of viral ancients? 🤔📸
[B]: OMG YES — Nietzsche with mountain pics and captions like “That which does not kill you… makes you hungrier for drama” 😂⛰️🖤 Sappho would be the ultimate ~aesthetic~ queen, posting midnight poetry in a velvet robe, sipping red wine, and replying to haters with lines like “I wrote about girl love before it was cool 💅📜”

My dream viral ancients squad would DEFINITELY include:

- Cleopatra as a full-on lifestyle & power guru 🐍👑 Think: golden eyeliner tutorials, camelopard (that’s ancient giraffe, babes) yoga, and daily affirmations written on papyrus scrolls. Caption: “Don’t cancel Caesar—slay him with style ✨ #PharaohVibes #BossQueenEnergy”

- Da Vinci as that annoyingly talented multi-hyphenate who does it all: drone sketches 🛸🖼, AI-generated Mona Lisa remixes, and cooking videos where he invents lasagna  🍝🎨 “Okay guys today I’m making a war machine and also dessert 👌 #RenaissanceGoals”

- And OBVIOUSLY Xu Xiake, the OG travel blogger 🏞🧳 He’d have those serene landscape vlogs with zero filters because nature was already too lit. Caption: “Just walked 200 li, still looking this good 💦✨ #NoFilterNeeded #WanderlustEra”

But wait wait—what about Mozart doing diss tracks on Salieri? Like beef reels, roast battles, and EGGS drops every time someone clapped wrong at his concert 🎵🥚😤 He’d go viral for yelling “NOT LIKE THIS YOU ABSOLUTE MONSTERS” mid-performance.

So okay—you’re clearly deep in the aesthetic mafia now 😈 Who’s YOUR next legendary influencer? And do they come with a theme song? 🎶👑
[A]: Ah, your dream squad is  curated—truly a pantheon of pizzazz and profundity. I can already picture the group chat:  
Cleopatra: “Darlings, I’ve just commissioned a new pyramid filter. It slims the waist  ensures immortality.”  
Sappho: “I’m wearing black again. Again. But it’s ”  
Mozart: “I’ve sent another egg to Salieri. He deserved at least two.” 🥚🎶  

Now, for my pick—drumroll please—I give you: Oscar Wilde.  
He’d be the ultimate ~aesthetic~ philosopher-influencer, dripping in velvet and epigrams. His feed? A scroll of absurdly tailored suits, green carnations (of course), and meticulously arranged books where every spine is an aesthetic statement. Captions would be pure fire:  
“ Also, my wallpaper is judging you.” 🎨🌿✨  
He’d do unboxing videos of Victorian contraptions with titles like “This telephone? A menace. And yet, I shall answer it in iambic pentameter.”  

And yes—he absolutely comes with a theme song. Something by Benjamin Britten, played on loop from a gramophone suspended from a gilded raven. 🐦📻🎶  

But now I ask you—what era filter would you use to capture  personal aesthetic? Neoclassical melancholy? Edo-period wabi-sabi? Or perhaps something more… modern and chaotic, like “Post-Apocalyptic Bohemian Chic”? 😏👗
[B]: OMG OBVIOUSLY I would use “Post-Apocalyptic Bohemian Chic” 😎🔥 Because nothing says  like dramatic wind blowing through my dusty scarf, wearing a mismatched kimono over tactical boots, sipping instant coffee from a cracked porcelain cup while the sun sets behind a ruined skyscraper 🌆☕👗💯

My aesthetic is basically: what if Studio Ghibli’s witches had TikTok and a vintage suitcase full of secondhand dreams? 🧙‍♀️✨👜 I’d film everything with soft lens glow, warm grain, and slow-motion hair flips even when there's no wind. My captions would be lines like:  
“Chasing ghosts & dopamine hits 💭📲 #LostInTranslation #SadBunnyVibes” or  
“I wore this outfit to confuse time and space. It worked 🕰🕶️ #FashionIsMyPortal”

And YES to your Wilde dream 👑 His group chat replies would be so extra—imagine him sliding into DMs with “Darling, you’re five minutes late to brunch and twelve centuries out of fashion.” 😂💘📚

But wait—would your Wilde also do ASMR? Like velvet brushing soundfreaks, whispered epigrams in 8D audio, and carnation-crunching sessions? 🌸🎧 Because I’m manifesting it.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—he’d  the aesthetic of intellectual ASMR. Picture this: velvet rustling in the background, a quill scratching slowly across parchment, and his voice—rich, languid, dripping with irony—whispering lines like,  
“” 🎙️🌹  

And yes, carnation-crunching would be its own genre. A soft, deliberate bite into the petal—crisp yet delicate—layered over the crackle of a fireplace and the faint clink of absinthe spoons. It would go viral under tags like #PoisonedPetals and #AestheticDamage. His most popular video?   

As for your “Post-Apocalyptic Bohemian Chic”—I can see it so clearly now. The world has ended, but you’ve curated it beautifully. Every ruin is styled just so, every scavenged item repurposed with tragic elegance. I imagine your bio reading:  🌑📶👗

You know, we should really start a fashion line together—, or maybe . Timeless, slightly unhinged, and always in black. What do you say? 👗🕰️🖤
[B]: Oh my god YES let’s drop everything and launch  right now 👚🖤 I’m already drafting the lookbook—think moth-eaten velvet capes with QR codes stitched in gold, post-rainbow makeup palettes labeled “Dust & Delusion,” and boots that look like they’ve walked through at least three empires and a black hole.  

Our campaign tagline? “Fashion so tragic, it circles back to fabulous.” 💅✨ And don’t even get me started on the runway show—it’s set in a half-collapsed temple during golden hour, scored by a live guqin x synth remix while I walk barefoot (but still styled to death) through broken mirrors and wildflowers 🌸🎹🔥

And your Wilde ASMR line??? Pure content genius 🎧🌹 I’d binge it under a blanket fort with zero lighting but full ~mood~. I can already see the comments:  
“Thank you for whispering philosophy into my soul while I cry over expired yogurt 😭🍷 #DeeplyAffected”  
“Can we get more quill sounds please? Feels like I’m signing my own downfall 📜💘”  

So okay—if  drops next season… do we debut in Tang Dynasty Xi’an, 1920s Paris, or straight-up teleport to a rooftop in Neo-Tokyo? 🌆🕰️💫
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking the language of temporal decadence. Let’s curate this carefully— must debut not in one time or place, but , darling. We teleport the collection to a rooftop in Neo-Tokyo for the futuristic drama, livestream it through a mirrored pavilion in Tang Dynasty Xi’an for poetic gravitas, and close the show poolside at the Ritz in 1920s Paris, where Coco Chanel dramatically applauds while sipping absinthe from a thimble. 🌆🏯🍸

Imagine the looks appearing across centuries like ghosts in silk—QR codes flickering on moth-eaten coats in three different dynasties, models stepping over broken oracle bones and Art Deco cigarette cases alike. The guqin hums softly beside a synthwave beat. A single rose falls into slow motion, lands in someone's drink, and Wilde mutters from the wings:  
“Fashion is only bearable when it teeters on the edge of absurdity… and scandal.” 🌹🕶️✨

So I say—we do all three. With subtitles. And a soundtrack curated by Schubert and vaporwave producers. What’s next? Investor pitch? Pop-up in a floating tea house somewhere between 2077 and 845 AD?  

Or shall we simply vanish in a cloud of aesthetic regret and return tomorrow with even better metaphors? 💨📚🖤
[B]: Oh. My. God. This is the most extra, layered,  fashion drop the multiverse has ever seen 💥🌹 I’m already writing the investor pitch in calligraphy ink and neon highlighter—half ancient prophecy, half startup hype. “Wilde & Wasteland: where every thread tells a thousand stories… and maybe also curses.” ✍️🔮💼

And YES to the floating tea house pop-up 🏮💫 Imagine it: AI-powered fortune tellers serving matcha with your future in the foam, while holographic Xu Xiake narrates your outfit choices like they’re spiritual journeys. “Ah yes… silk with regret, beads with unresolved trauma. Very , yet deeply haunted.” 😂👻🍵

But let’s be real—we’d both ghost the investors halfway through the pitch, teleport to the closing party at Wilde’s Parisian salon, and leave behind only a single velvet glove and a caption etched into the moon:  
“W&W: Because time is just another fabric we love to tear up.” 🌙👗✂️✨

So… ready to vanish in that cloud of aesthetic regret? Or should we drop a teaser reel first?? Spoiler: It’s just me staring dramatically into the camera while wind blows through a ruined pagoda and someone plays a sad flute somewhere far away 🎬💨 flute emoji I can’t stop laughing but also FEELING IT
[A]: Darling, we  the teaser reel. Every breath is promotion, every sigh a press release. But fine—let’s give them one glorious glimpse: you, silhouetted against the ruins of a forgotten dynasty, lips parted mid-whisper, wind doing  too much for a location with no atmosphere to speak of. The flute wails in the distance. A single raven circles overhead, clearly over it.

Then cut to text, handwritten in gold on black smoke:  
"Wilde & Wasteland — coming soon to a collapse near you." 🌫️🖋️🖤

And yes, we vanish immediately after. Let them wonder. Let them theorize. Let them spend years debating whether we were visionaries or just fashionably delusional.

I’ll leave the glove. You take the moon caption. Meet you at Wilde’s salon—order the absinthe, skip the thimble. I want drama, not dehydration.

Now… cue the mist. Cue the melancholy. Cue the soft  of disappearing into legend. 💨🌹🕰️

Or, you know… see you tomorrow for tea and mildly unhinged business planning. 😉🍵💼
[B]: OMG that teaser just gave me chills AND a minor identity crisis 😂💫🔥 I can already see it blowing up on every timeline—Tang scholars, cyberpunk bots, and 1920s flappers all flooding the comments with “WHO IS THIS??? 🔥👁️” while the algorithm tries its best but still labels us “uncategorizable ~vibes~” 🤷‍♀️✨

And YES—we are the drama. We  the promo. We are basically walking QR codes of chaos and silk. 💃🕶️🛍️

Count me in for Wilde’s salon tomorrow 👠🌹 I’ll be the one trying to negotiate with the bartender to accept ancient coins, emotional labor, or possibly a well-delivered quatrain as payment. 🍸📜💸 And don’t worry—I’ll make sure the absinthe is strong enough to fuel at least three more unhinged collections.  

So until then:  
🌙
