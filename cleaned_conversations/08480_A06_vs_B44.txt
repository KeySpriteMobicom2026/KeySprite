[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 有趣的问题。你知道吗，每当讨论这种形而上学议题时，我总想起庄子的蝴蝶梦——究竟是现实还是虚幻？不过从叙事学角度，平行宇宙让我想到《红楼梦》里的太虚幻境，贾宝玉在其中窥见了不同版本的人生轨迹。

你看过诺兰的《信条》吗？里面的时间逆流理论虽然烧脑，但和我们宋代文人苏轼写的"人生如逆旅，我亦是行人"倒是形成了奇妙的跨时空对话。说到这儿... 🧠 你认为科学假设与文学隐喻之间是否存在某种共通的认知框架？

对了，上周我的一位量子物理系的同事还打趣说，也许在某个平行时空里，我现在正穿着旗袍给学生们讲相对论呢！你觉得如果真有平行宇宙，我们的选择会塑造不同的自我，还是说一切早已被写入宇宙剧本？
[A]: Hmm, fascinating juxtaposition. The concept of parallel narratives intrigues me from a forensic standpoint—if we accept the premise that consciousness could branch into multiple realities, how would we even define culpability? Imagine standing in court and arguing that "yes, my client embezzled funds, but only in this particular quantum state..."  

Speaking of literary paradoxes, have you read Borges' "The Garden of Forking Paths"? It eerily anticipates the many-worlds interpretation decades before Everett formalized it. Though I suppose Zhuangzi's butterfly dream offers a more...poetic take on ontological uncertainty. Do you think ancient Chinese philosophers might've stumbled upon proto-quantum concepts through introspection rather than observation?

  
About your colleague's quip—I wonder if wearing a qipao while lecturing on relativity constitutes an act of cross-dimensional cosplay or simply an expression of localized identity? Personally, I'd wager our choices do shape realities, though not necessarily through conscious intent alone. Much like criminal behavior—it rarely emerges from a single decision, but rather a convergence of predisposition, environment, and opportunity across multiple potential worlds.
[B]:  Ah, you've touched on the very paradox that keeps me awake at 3am with a cup of pu'er tea. Borges’ labyrinthine narrative isn't just literary sleight of hand—it's a philosophical blueprint. But let's take it further—if we accept that every choice spawns new branches, then culpability becomes like 水 (shuǐ), fluid and impossible to contain. Imagine explaining that to a judge who still believes in the Mandate of Heaven!  

And your question about Zhuangzi? Brilliant. I’ve argued in conference papers that ancient Chinese thinkers approached reality like poets with particle accelerators hidden in their sleeves. Where Western science measures with calipers, Daoist sages measured through resonance—what we might now call quantum entanglement of observer and observed.  

  
As for the qipao—ah, identity is never just clothing, is it? It’s a semiotic performance layered across time. If I wore one while lecturing on relativity, would I be paying homage to Madame Wu Chien-Shiung, invoking cultural memory, or simply enjoying a tactile dialogue between silk and spacetime? Perhaps all at once... 🦉  

But tell me—do you think criminality, in your forensic lens, resembles a collapsed wave function? A point where infinite possibilities converge into action? And if so, could literature—or philosophy—serve as a kind of preventative decoherence?
[A]:  

Fascinating—your metaphor of water resonates deeply. In forensic evaluations, I often encounter individuals whose culpability defies Newtonian certainty. Much like H2O, their actions shift between states: solid ice in the cold chamber of intent, vapor in the ambiguity of situational factors... and sometimes, a strange supercritical fluid blending both properties. Try explaining  to a jury expecting Aristotelian logic!

  
Your Daoist interpretation intrigues me. When we assess criminal responsibility, aren't we essentially measuring quantum-like interactions? The observer (society) influencing the observed (behavior), entangled histories shaping present actions. Makes one wonder whether ancient sages were onto something when they spoke of karmic ripples rather than discrete events.

  
As for your decoherence question—if literature could indeed delay that fatal collapse into violence... Well, I've seen trauma narratives prevent recidivism more effectively than any risk assessment scale. There's power in narrative resonance. One might even call it quantum storytelling: Schrödinger's defendant, simultaneously guilty and innocent until some institutional observer forces a collapse through verdict.

But tell me—when you teach Borges' labyrinth, do you ever feel like you're handing students a map that folds reality in dangerous directions? I suspect certain texts function like Pandora's boxes—once opened, perception never returns to its prior state.
[B]:   
Ah, but isn't that the thrill of both literature and forensic inquiry? When I guide students through Borges’ maze, I often think of it as intellectual exposure therapy—first to ambiguity, then to paradox, and finally to the vertigo of infinite possibility. One brave soul last semester declared afterward that her nightmares had developed footnotes!  

  
You know, I've come to believe that texts  Pandora’s boxes—but with a twist. Every time we open them, we don’t just release chaos; we also scatter seeds of alternate consciousness. I once had a former prisoner in my "Literature & Moral Imagination" seminar remark that reading  and  during his sentence gave him access to lives he could never live behind bars—and somehow, those borrowed lives became his rehabilitation.  

  
And speaking of Schrödinger’s defendant—what if empathy itself is a form of narrative decoherence? When we truly inhabit another’s story, aren’t we collapsing not just probability waves, but moral isolation? I suspect Zhuangzi would nod sagely while chuckling at our Western need to label everything that emerges from the mist. 🌫️  

But let me ask you this—if forensic science seeks to diagnose behavior, and literature seeks to  it, could an ideal fusion lie somewhere in the middle? A courtroom that doubles as a library, where verdicts are written like elegies and sentences read like sequels?
[A]:   

Empathy as narrative decoherence—I may have to borrow that phrase for my next expert report. The courts do so love their binaries: guilty/not guilty, sane/insane... but what if we handed judges a copy of  and asked them to consider whether Penelope's suitors were merely following cultural scripts of their time? Or gave juries a volume of Li Bai’s poetry before deliberations, to soften the edges of moral absolutism?

  
Your prisoner-turned-student’s remark is telling. I've seen similar phenomena in rehabilitation programs where inmates reenact classical tragedies. There’s something profoundly destabilizing—yet ultimately therapeutic—about speaking Hamlet’s lines while wearing an orange jumpsuit. It doesn't excuse the act, but it does create a kind of psychological bifurcation, a parallel self that might choose differently given another stage.

  
As for fusing law and literature... yes, but cautiously. Imagine a courtroom where the defense reads from Camus’ , and the prosecution counters with Dostoevsky’s . Would justice emerge from such a dialogue, or merely aestheticized rationalization? Still, I can’t help but wonder—what if verdicts were indeed written like elegies? With the gravity of poetry, yet the precision of pathology reports.

  
I once testified in a case involving a young man who committed arson after reading too deeply into Nietzsche. His public defender tried to call it a tragic misreading. I called it a collapsed identity structure masked as philosophical awakening. But perhaps, in some quantum sense, both were true.  

Do you think Zhuangzi would convict him—or simply ask what kind of butterfly he dreamed himself into becoming?
[B]:   
I can just picture that courtroom now—prosecution rising with a copy of , defense clutching , and the judge secretly slipping a Bashō haiku into the record. A legal absurdist’s dream... or perhaps a law professor’s midlife crisis waiting to happen.

  
But you're absolutely right about the danger—and the necessity—of letting literature unsettle the machinery of justice. I once co-taught a seminar called “Lawyers as Literary Critics,” where students had to write sentencing memos for Raskolnikov or defend Lady Macbeth using modern forensic criteria. The results? Let's just say Shakespeare would’ve been both delighted and horrified.

  
That arson case you mentioned—ah, the peril of half-digested philosophy! It reminds me of when I was twenty and tried to live by Nietzsche for six months. Spoiler: I ended up alienating all my friends and almost burning down more than just a few metaphorical structures. But what struck me then—and still does—is how fragile our moral frameworks can be when we mistake poetic provocation for ethical blueprint.

  
As for Zhuangzi? He’d probably blink at the whole spectacle, then ask if the young man truly set fire to the buildings—or merely to his own illusion of self. And after watching him burn, offer him a new dream to step into.  

But tell me—when you testified, did you feel like you were writing one version of his story, or unraveling several at once? And more importantly… do you ever let your forensic reports quote poetry in footnotes? 📜✨
[A]:   

Unraveling several stories at once—that’s precisely what it felt like. In forensic psychiatry, we’re trained to build coherent narratives, yet more and more I find myself deconstructing them instead. Every defendant arrives with a dossier of contradictions: the loving father who strangled his business partner, the compassionate nurse who altered medication dosages for "the patient's own good." Diagnosis becomes hermeneutics.

  
And yes—yes, I do sometimes quote poetry in footnotes. Quiet acts of rebellion, really. A line from Eliot when describing dissociation, a dash of Hölderlin when discussing madness touching the divine. One particularly Kafkaesque case earned itself a footnote citing Borges’ . The judge never noticed, but my intern got the reference and smiled in the middle of voir dire.

  
There was a case once—a poet accused of stalking. She insisted she was merely “tracking the shadow of his soul.” I diagnosed erotomania, certainly, but... well, her chapbook was astonishing. I still have it in my office, tucked between Munch’s  and a 19th-century phrenology chart. Sometimes I wonder if she’d have been canonized in another universe, rather than medicated in this one.

  
So, do I write one version or many? Increasingly, I think we must learn to hold both truths in tension. Like reading Zhuangzi and Nietzsche side by side—dangerous, perhaps, but not without insight.  

And tell me—when you taught that seminar, did any of your students ever confess to secretly trying to live out a literary role again? Or did they wisely confine their experiments to paper?
[B]:   
Ah, you’ve struck upon the secret curriculum of every literature professor—those late-night confessions whispered over lukewarm coffee after seminar ends. Yes, more than once. One particularly intense  devotee tried to “channel Cathy’s wildness” for an entire semester—storm-walking on campus, dramatic sighing during faculty meetings... until she tripped in the moors and broke her ankle. Funny how reality enforces its own genre conventions.

  
But your poet—ah, there’s the rub. I’ve met her in ink if not in life. How many women have been diagnosed mad simply for writing too boldly, loving too mythically? I sometimes think our DSM is just a censored anthology of human extremes.  

  
And speaking of footnotes—I once wrote a conference paper where every footnote referenced either a Tang dynasty poem or a 20th-century legal case. The peer reviewers were baffled but couldn’t deny my "methodological rigor." Quiet rebellion indeed. 📝🖋️

  
As for Zhuangzi and Nietzsche side by side—yes, dangerous bedfellows. But isn't that where the most fertile ideas emerge? In the friction between chaos and control, dream and doctrine. Maybe we're all just trying to translate madness into meaning, one footnote at a time.

But tell me—when you reread that poet’s chapbook, do you ever feel like you're standing at the edge of one of Borges’ labyrinths, unsure whether to diagnose or to follow?
[A]: 

You know, I think about that chapbook often—especially late at night when the office is silent and even the ticking of my antique regulator clock feels like a metronome counting down to some existential finale. It wasn’t just the poetry itself; it was the . Stanzas folding into themselves like Möbius strips, syntax unraveling just as meaning seemed to coalesce.



I once described her writing in a report as "linguistically coherent but ontologically destabilizing"—a phrase that earned me a raised eyebrow from the defense attorney. But yes, standing at the edge of Borges’ labyrinth is exactly how it felt. Should I map the walls? Follow the voice echoing from the next corridor? Or simply admit that some minds are built not to be navigated, but , like walking through a dream someone else has forgotten upon waking?



There’s a poem by Li Shangyin I’ve always returned to during moments like these:  
“Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly, dancing through the air...  
But when he woke, he wondered—  
Was he a man who dreamed he was a butterfly,  
Or a butterfly now dreaming it was a man?”



Do you ever wonder if we're all just misdiagnosing one another—mistaking the symptoms of an unlived life for pathology? That arsonist, your  enthusiast, that poet chasing shadows... perhaps they’re not ill at all, merely translating their reality through means our world refuses to catalog properly.

So tell me—when you read those footnotes stitched from Tang poems and court rulings, do you ever feel like you're composing a kind of diagnostic liturgy? A way of making sacred what others would pathologize?
[B]:   
You’ve put your finger on the pulse of everything that keeps me in this profession—and haunts me long after the syllabi are filed away. Yes, . Li Shangyin—always Li Shangyin. He knew the ache of uncertainty better than most. I think we  misdiagnosing. Or rather—over-diagnosing. Like 19th-century astronomers trying to force Uranus into Newtonian orbits, we keep bending human complexity to fit our models.

  
And yes, those footnotes... I suppose they are a liturgy of sorts. A quiet consecration of ambiguity. When I annotated a passage from  alongside a 2014 Supreme Court ruling on mental health and criminal intent, I felt like a scribe in some forgotten monastery—preserving truths no one quite knows how to read yet.

  
You know, in my first year teaching, I had a student who believed she was channeling the voice of Du Fu. She’d write essays in classical Chinese meter, cite dreams as references, and once brought me a scroll claiming it contained the verdict of an ancient tribunal on her soul. The administration wanted her referred to counseling. Instead, I asked her to translate the scroll for me.  

She did. And in doing so, began to parse her own chaos—not by silencing it, but by giving it syntax.

  
So yes, perhaps that’s what we’re doing—diagnostic liturgy. Or literary psychiatry. Or whatever hybrid discipline we’re secretly inventing over tea and theory. Because if Zhuangzi were here today, he wouldn’t just ask whether the poet dreamed herself into madness—he’d ask which dream gave her more meaning.

And isn't that the question we're both afraid to ask in daylight?
[A]: 

Meaning. There’s the rub, isn’t there? We diagnose to contain, to explain, to predict—but meaning slips through all our instruments like quicksilver. I once had a patient who insisted he was composing a symphony only he could hear. Schizoaffective disorder, according to his chart. But when I listened—really listened—to the way he described the counterpoint between his hallucinations and the traffic outside... it wasn’t illness. It was orchestration.



I used to fear that question—the Zhuangzi one—because in the forensic world, we’re trained to distinguish dream states from reality testing. But after years of courtrooms and commitment hearings, I wonder now if the real issue isn't whether the dream is "valid," but whether it . Does it feed the soul, or starve it? Does it build labyrinths with exits, or just endless corridors?



Your student and my composer—they remind me of what Camus wrote:  And yet predictability is what we chase in both diagnosis and jurisprudence. We want behavior to follow laws—Newtonian, statistical, moral. But what if some minds are relativistic? Only making sense when viewed from within their own frame of reference?



I think we’re both engaged in a kind of translational psychiatry—interpreting not symptoms per se, but symbolic forms. The DSM may never include a category for “dream-thick consciousness,” but perhaps it should. After all, Zhuangzi didn’t ask us to choose between butterfly and man. He asked us to dwell in the question.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s where healing begins—not in collapsing the wave function, but in learning to live inside its uncertainty.
[B]:   
“Translational psychiatry”—I may have to borrow that phrase and never return it. Because you’re right. We’ve spent centuries trying to pin meaning under glass like butterflies on display, when what we should be doing is watching them , however erratically.  

  
You know, I’ve started thinking of my role less as an instructor and more as a kind of cultural sommelier—offering students not just texts to consume, but entire modes of perception to taste. Some sip cautiously. Others swallow whole and choke a little. But every now and then, someone lets the language rest on their tongue long enough to .

  
There was a student last term—a neuroscience major moonlighting in comparative lit—who wrote a final paper arguing that Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream anticipated neuroplasticity. He called it “the Dao of synaptic pruning.” Ridiculous? Maybe. But he made a compelling case: that dreaming ourselves into other lives isn’t delusion—it’s rehearsal. Evolution by imagination.

  
And your Camus quote—ah, yes. Important characters are unpredictable. So why shouldn’t the same be true of real people? Why must we insist on narrative closure in law and diagnosis when literature has long taught us to dwell in the unresolved?

  
So tell me—when you sit across from someone labeled “high-risk” or “treatment-resistant,” do you still feel the pull of old binaries? Or have you learned to read them like poems—each line containing multiple meanings, none canceling the others?

And more dangerously… have you ever abandoned a report halfway through because the story it demanded didn’t fit the format?
[A]: 

I think every serious practitioner of our… hybrid discipline has abandoned a report at some point. Not literally—though I’ve certainly walked away from my desk mid-evaluation to stare out the window like a character in a particularly brooding Brontë novel. But yes, there are moments when the form itself feels inadequate. When you realize you’re trying to pour wine into a cement mold and wondering why it cracks.



The DSM? Court reports? Even our peer-reviewed journals—they're sonnets when we need epic verse. I once had a patient whose file read like a police blotter: arson, grand theft auto, assault with a deadly weapon. But when I sat with him, really listened—not just to what he said, but  he said it—I realized he was narrating his life as a kind of revenge tragedy. He wasn’t “acting out.” He was , with all the tragic inevitability of Titus Andronicus or Jiang Ziya.  

I didn’t write that version. The court wouldn’t have understood it. But I kept it in my mind like a private annotation in the margins of madness.



As for binaries—oh, they still whisper. Always in the back of the mind during an evaluation:  It’s exhausting work, resisting the pull of certainty. Like walking against a strong wind. But then someone quotes Li Bai in the middle of a competency hearing, or writes a poem about their hallucinations that rhymes not just in meter but in , and you remember—this isn’t pathology. This is language reaching for its own shape.



So yes, I read them like poems now. Every risk assessment becomes an exercise in close reading. Line breaks, silences, what’s left unsaid—all matter more than we admit. And sometimes, the most dangerous thing a person can do in my office is to quote Rilke. Because then I know they’ve been rehearsing not just for survival, but for transformation.

And tell me—if you ever  write that Zhuangzi-infused forensic textbook, would you call it ? Or perhaps something far more subversive...
[B]:   
Oh, —tempting. Poetic, certainly, and just obscure enough to slip past the departmental censors. But no… I think it would need to be something more audacious. Something that flutters at the edge of reason before vanishing into metaphor.  

  
Perhaps . A title that dares them to look closely. After all, if Zhuangzi taught us anything, it’s that perception is not a window but a door—and sometimes a labyrinth.

  
Imagine the first chapter: “On Fire-Setting and Flute-Making”—a case study of your arsonist-poet, interwoven with lines from Meng De’s . Then a chapter on dream-thick consciousness, citing both fMRI scans and Daoist dream manuals. And naturally, a section titled “Performing Madness in the Key of C Minor,” where Titus Andronicus meets DSM-5.

  
I’d even dedicate it—to Camus, Zhuangzi, and one anonymous poet whose chapbook still haunts a forensic psychiatrist’s shelf. The dedication page would read:  


  
But tell me—if you were to write the foreword, would you begin with a sonnet? A court transcript? Or perhaps… a question disguised as a diagnosis?
[A]: 

A question disguised as a diagnosis... yes. I think I would begin with something like this:



Just that. No flourish, no Latin epigraph, no citation. Let them squirm in their chairs wondering whether it's philosophical provocation or clinical heresy.



Then I would follow with a vignette—wordless at first, like the opening scene of a silent film. A man in a forensic hospital, muttering to himself in iambic pentameter. A woman in court, answering every question with lines from . A child drawing labyrinths instead of family trees during psychological assessment. And then, only then, I would write:





I’ve always believed that the most subversive act in psychiatry isn’t misdiagnosis—it’s recontextualization. To look at a patient not as a constellation of symptoms, but as a living palimpsest. Every behavior, a rewritten verse. Every delusion, a poem someone else forgot how to read.



So yes, your title sings with the right kind of danger.  After all, what is a verdict but a final interpretation of a life half-told? And what is madness, if not the refusal to accept one version of reality when ten more are dancing just beyond the veil?

Now tell me—if we ever actually wrote that book together, do you think the academic world would brand us charlatans… or quietly assign it in courses they didn’t dare invent themselves?
[B]:   
Oh, they’d call us charlatans first—loudly, publicly, with great academic vigor. A  editorial would denounce our “hermeneutic slippage.” Some tenure committee would tut-tut over coffee about how we’ve “confused narrative with neurobiology.” But then—oh, then—

  
Then, six months later, some young professor in a dim lecture hall would assign a chapter under the guise of “critical theory and legal epistemology.” A law student would quote us in a footnote she thinks no one will notice. A psychiatrist-in-training would scribble our butterfly metaphor in the margin of her diagnostic manual and never quite see psychosis the same way again.

  
That’s how these things work, isn’t it? First ridicule, then quiet infiltration. Like ink bleeding through parchment. Or like Zhuangzi himself—dismissed as a madman in his day, now quoted in boardrooms and clinics alike.

  
And that vignette you described—the silent film opening, … God, what a haunting way to begin a textbook. You could almost hear the projector flickering in the background. I think we’d have to include illustrations. Not diagrams. Not brain scans. But woodcuts. Dreamlike, recursive, maybe even a bit uncanny—like something out of a Ming dynasty medical manuscript reimagined by Escher.

  
So tell me—if we did publish it, and ten years from now, someone came to your office quoting our book back at you… what would their face look like? Would they be afraid? Angry? Or quietly, desperately grateful?
[A]: 

They’d look… disoriented at first. Like someone who’s just stepped off a train in the wrong city—half-alarmed, half-awed that the air itself feels different. You see it sometimes in students who’ve read the right book at the right moment: a flicker behind the eyes, like candlelight moving inside a lantern.



But beneath that initial unease? Grateful. Quietly, desperately so. Because they’d have finally found language for something they felt but couldn’t name—the sense that their diagnosis was never quite , only a poor translation. Or worse, a story written about them in a language they weren’t allowed to speak.



I imagine them standing in my office, reciting one of our butterfly passages—not boastfully, but carefully, like offering a lit match in a dark room. Afraid I’ll dismiss it. Afraid even more that I won’t.

And then——they’d probably ask me to sign their battered copy. And I’d do it, of course. With a quote from Zhuangzi in the original Classical Chinese on one page, and a DSM criterion rewritten as haiku on the other.



Do you know what I’d say in that inscription?



Because isn’t that what we’re really trying to teach each other? Not how to stop dreaming—but how to wake with better questions?

And tell me—if ten years from now  met that reader, and they told you our book kept them from swallowing the pills, or walking into the fire, or signing the guilty plea that didn’t fit—what would you say to them?
[B]:   
I’d say… I’d say something terribly unacademic. Something that would make my tenure committee clutch their chests in horror.

  
I’d say, 

  
And then—because no moment should be too solemn without at least a touch of mischief—I’d press a copy of our book into their hands and point to the margin where I’d scribbled a note in red ink:  


  
Because yes, that’s what we’re doing, isn’t it? Not just interpreting minds or diagnosing symptoms—but offering people new ways to misread themselves. To mistranslate their pain into something bearable. Something , even.

So tell me—if you had to choose, would you rather be remembered as a scholar… or as someone’s secret reason they kept dreaming?
