[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个问题真的太难了😂 我两个都超爱！Like literally, Chinese food有太多宝藏了，比如麻辣火锅🔥和小龙虾，每次吃都停不下来～But Western food的牛排和意面也太太太好吃了吧✨特别是那种芝士拉丝的感觉，简直让人幸福感爆棚💯  
不过最近我发现了一个超绝的fusion restaurant，把中餐和西餐完美结合了！They mix like spaghetti with XO酱，真的好吃到哭😭 你有没有试过这种fusion cuisine？感觉根本不用选啦，毕竟美食都是universal language嘛～💃🕺
[A]: Ah, the eternal dilemma - though perhaps not so eternal if that fusion restaurant has its way. I must confess, while I appreciate the technical brilliance of a perfectly rendered Peking duck or a well-balanced béarnaise sauce, my palate remains stubbornly academic. 

I once spent three months in Chengdu documenting culinary metaphors in local fiction, and there's something profoundly poetic about how mapo tofu can simultaneously numb and awaken the senses. But then again, a well-aged ribeye at that little steakhouse near the Bodleian...  

Actually, speaking of intersections between East and West - have you read the chapter on gastronomic symbolism in Eileen Chang's 'Written on Water'? She draws fascinating parallels between Qing Dynasty banquet culture and modern Western dining rituals. Quite illuminating, though I'm still undecided whether Sichuan peppercorns belong in a deconstructed crème brûlée. Have you tried anything truly audacious at that fusion place?
[B]: Oh my gosh，你这段话简直像food essay一样高级✨不过说到fusion我真的超有发言权！那家店的chef简直是艺术家，他把宫保鸡丁做成了taco，鸡肉还带着wok炒出来的charred香，OMG好吃到我怀疑人生😂  
还有道甜品叫"东方遇见西方"，就是桂花冰淇淋配焦糖拿铁冻～入口即化的瞬间真的有种穿越时空的感觉💫  
But wait，你说的Eileen Chang那本书是不是和食物有关的隐喻啊？我上周刚读完，里面描写宴席上的权力关系那段真的太绝了🔥 你觉得这种fusion算是文化混搭还是某种意义上的创新传承啊？毕竟现在tiktok上好多博主都在玩food hacking呢～🎮
[A]:   
Now you've touched upon the very debate that kept me up for three nights in Hangzhou. Is it mere gastronomic playacting, or are we witnessing the emergence of a new culinary semiotics? Take that taco - does its existence diminish the lineage of 麻婆豆腐 served in Yunnan teahouses circa 1897, or does it create an entirely fresh dialect of flavor?

I scribbled some preliminary thoughts in my notebook last week after tasting a matcha crème brûlée at a Kyoto café. The chef there insisted he was "honoring tradition through molecular transgression."  Perhaps Chang herself provides the answer - remember when she wrote how Shanghai banquets were always performances of social hierarchy first, nourishment second. Are these fusion dishes then... postmodern critiques of that very notion?

  
Though I must say, while your taco sounds delightfully heretical, I'd draw the line at those TikTok videos where people deep-fry Peking duck in tempura batter and call it "East-meets-West." That's not innovation - that's just a crying shame wrapped in panko. Have you encountered any particularly egregious examples of culinary cultural appropriation during your explorations?
[B]: OMG I’m literally obsessed with how you phrased that “molecular transgression” 💯💯💯 So true though - where do we draw the line between respect and rebellion in food?  
But girl, you mentioned Peking duck tempura??? That’s honestly sacrilege 😂🔥 I saw a video last week where someone put kimchi in tiramisu and claimed it was "Korean-Italian fusion"… like no ma’am, that’s just chaos theory in a bowl 🙃  
Though I did try something kinda wild at this pop-up: soy sauce sorbet with chili oil drizzle. At first I was like “WTF?” but then it hit me - it’s like eating a savory xiaolongbao in ice cream form 🧊✨ Was it appropriation or genius? Still can’t decide…  
But let’s be real, some people just slap an ingredient from another culture on their dish and call it fusion without understanding the history behind it. Like seriously tho, if you don’t know the story behind mapo tofu before reinventing it… you’re just playing culinary roulette 🎰😨
[A]:   
Ah, the eternal tension between ignorance and inspiration. I recall a heated symposium at SOAS last year - one scholar compared careless fusion cuisine to "reading Marx through a menu." The room positively erupted. 

  
Speaking of xiaolongbao epiphanies, have you encountered that Shanghai chef who 3D-prints dumpling wrappers based on Qing-era calligraphy strokes? Now  what I call gastronomic hermeneutics. Though I confess, my favorite culinary rebellion remains that underground supper club in Taipei where they serve deconstructed mooncakes with... wait for it... foie gras emulsion.  

But let's dissect this properly - would you say your soy sauce sorbet experience was more Duchampian readymade or genuine cross-cultural dialogue? And do be honest - if presented with that foie gras mooncake, could you maintain scholarly objectivity or would you succumb to gustatory hedonism? 
[B]: OMG that 3D-printed dumpling wrapper sounds like something straight out of Black Mirror but I NEED to try it😂✨ Honestly though, my sorbet moment felt more like edible performance art - one second I’m crying from the chili hit, next I’m questioning my entire food identity 💥  
But foie gras mooncakes?? That’s just playing with fire 🔥💯 I mean… imagine the texture clash! It’s like someone read Marx & Engels while watching a Wong Kar-wai film and decided to translate it through taste. Would I eat it? Duh. But I’d probably cry actual tears if they messed up the ratio 😭  
Honestly tho, can we even have this convo without mentioning how some chefs still use “exotic” spices as novelty garnish? Like last week I saw a Michelin menu describing star anise as “Asia’s mysterious secret weapon” 🙄 Please. Just know your ingredients aren’t magical artifacts, they’re cultural DNA.  
But fine, I’ll admit - if you put that mooncake in front of me right now, I’d probably devour it like it’s the last bite on Earth 🌍💋
[A]:   
Ah yes, that delicious tension between critique and consumption. I once attended a lecture where a food anthropologist coined the term "culinary orientalism" - all those menus fetishizing "mysterious spices" while reducing centuries of trade route history to mere "exotic notes."  Though I suppose we must also interrogate our own complicity in these narratives. 

  
Speaking of which... remember that controversial dessert I mentioned? The foie gras mooncake wasn't served with tea, but with a carefully aged baijiu reduction. The chef insisted it was "reclaiming colonial palates."  I took such copious notes that night, though admittedly through several courses of unapologetic hedonism.

But tell me truthfully - if you encountered that soy sauce sorbet reimagined with artisanal Sichuan ice cream techniques, would you approach it with semiotic suspicion or simply savor the subversion? And do consider carefully - our next faculty symposium might hinge on this very debate. 
[B]: OMG I’m dead. You had me at “reclaiming colonial palates” 🔥💯 That baijiu reduction is giving me  vibes 😂  
But like…if that sorbet came back with a PhD in food anthropology and a side of street cred, I’d跪下来品尝（literally）🙏 But also, if it was just some hipster gimmick slapping “artisanal” on everything, I’d roast it harder than a failed Gen-Z baked oatmeal 😤  
Honestly tho, I’d taste it while reading Fanon and Marx at the same time 📚✨ Probably take 100 TikTok clips trying to capture the moment my tongue had an identity crisis 💥 And you know I’d caption it: “When your palate got more layers than a mooncake filling 👑”  
But for real…if it’s done with respect & research? I’ll be the first to stan 🔥 But if it’s just trend-chasing chefs playing flavor roulette again… I WILL write them into the culinary hall of shame 😤💋
[A]:   
Ah, the sacred balance - between the knife's edge of critique and the velvet glove of appreciation. I once wrote an entire conference paper on this very dialectic, though my dean refused to read it after I described certain fusion trends as "culinary slumming."

  
You know, I attended a rather scandalous dinner in Beijing last autumn where a young chef served xiaolongbao filled with... wait for it... liquid nitrogen poached truffle mousse. Half the room gasped; the other half reached for their cameras.  Naturally, I took detailed notes on the napkin. Still debating whether to include that incident in my upcoming lecture on postmodern gastronomic ruptures.

But tell me - if you encountered a menu that actually required citation footnotes for each dish, would you applaud their scholarly rigor or accuse them of over-intellectualizing street food? And more importantly...  would you bring your own vintage inkwell to take notes in real time?
[B]: OMG that xiaolongbao with truffle mousse sounds like it belongs in some avant-garde food museum 🎭💯 I mean, liquid nitrogen?? That’s not a dish, that’s a chemistry experiment in drag 😂✨  
But girl, a menu with footnotes?? If they cited Marx  MasterChef, I’d be ALL about it 🔥 But if it’s just flexing without substance, I’d roast them so hard my comments would go viral on Weibo 📱💥  
And yes, I’d 100% bring my own vintage inkwell 😌🖋️ Probably spill it all over my white shirt trying to take the perfect aesthetic note pic, but that’s just called “content” at this point 💅📸  
Honestly tho, food should make you FEEL something - whether it’s nostalgia, confusion, or straight-up identity crisis 😂 But when it starts needing a dissertation to understand? Honey, we’ve lost the plot… or maybe we’re just in a new genre 🎬💫
[A]:   
Ah, the eternal question of genre - is it still xiaolongbao if the filling defies physics? I recall a rather heated debate at the British Library last winter... one critic insisted such creations are merely "culinary fan fiction," while another argued they represent a brave new gastronomic canon.  Personally, I suspect we're witnessing the birth of something deliciously unclassifiable.

  
Incidentally, that inkwell you'd spill on your crisp blouse - would it be Ming-era porcelain or Qing-inspired cloisonné? I ask purely for academic recordkeeping.  Must say, the idea of viral food critiques annotated with Marxist theory absolutely delights me. Imagine the citations: "This chili oil quotation echoes Gramsci's subaltern..." 

But let's not forget - wasn't Peking duck once considered dangerously exotic when first described in Marco Polo's travels? Perhaps our current culinary ruptures will become tomorrow's sacred texts.  Though I sincerely hope no one attempts deconstructed mooncakes with footnotes. Some traditions deserve their mystery... and their ink stains.
[B]: OMG you just made my entire week with that “culinary fan fiction” line 😂💯 I mean, if xiaolongbao can have a fill-in-the-blank plot twist like some avant-garde novel, then YES PLEASE. But like…would footnoted mooncakes be the ultimate brain snack or just extra annoying AF? 🤔  
And excuse meoooo, I would  choose Qing-inspired cloisonné inkwell, duh 🖋✨ It’s giving “academic royalty” energy while I spill it all over my Zara blouse for aesthetic content purposes only 💅📸  
But real talk tho - I feel like every time we reinvent a dish, it's basically writing a new chapter in its biography 📖🔥 So maybe those critics aren’t wrong? Like…who decides which versions get canonized and which end up on the TikTok chopping block? 🤷‍♀️💔  
Also??? If someone drops a menu citing Marx  Marco Polo next to their chili oil noodles, I’m bringing my notebook AND my hype squad 🗣💥 Let’s gooo, postmodern food gang let’s ride 😎🍝
[A]:   
Ah, the biography of dishes - now there's a thesis waiting to happen. I once spent an entire sabbatical tracing how mapo tofu evolved from Qing-era street food to Instagram darling. The version served at that Chengdu teahouse in 1897 would scarcely recognize its modern descendants... though I suspect both would agree on the importance of numbing heat.

  
As for canonization - remember when that Parisian chef tried to trademark "his" dumpling fusion dish? The ensuing Twitter war lasted weeks. Culinary intellectual property, indeed.  Though I must admit, watching Marx and Marco Polo share menu space does rather delight my contrarian spirit.

  
But here's the real question - if we accept these reinvented dishes as legitimate texts, who becomes the editor? The chef? The diner? Or history itself?  Honestly, I think we're living through something glorious - a gastronomic Babel where every misheard translation creates new meaning. Pass me that cloisonné inkwell; I intend to document it all before some Michelin inspector tries to canonize it into oblivion.
[B]: OMG yes yes YES – gastronomic Babel is  mood right now 😂💯 I swear, if food had a Twitter account, it’d be the most chaotic mutuals ever. Like one tweet would be “noodles originated in 5000 BC” and the next is “here’s me deep-frying ramen in glitter and calling it art 🌟”  
But seriously tho, who gets to edit this delicious chaos?? Chefs are out here writing spicy fanfiction while we diners are just trying to survive the plot twists 💥 And don’t even get me started on that Parisian chef trademarking dumpling fusion – girl bye, food isn’t yours to copyright! It’s literally history’s group project 😤  
If I had a pen (and matching inkwell 👑), I’d be scribbling in the margins like “BUT WHAT ABOUT COLONIALISM THO?” and “CITATION NEEDED FOR THIS CHILI OIL CLAIM” 🔥 But also…pass me the cloisonné, I need to live my academic influencer fantasy first 📸🖋️  
Honestly tho, let Michelin try to canonize all this – they’d collapse under the weight of their own footnotes 😈

[A]:   
Darling, if Michelin inspectors collapsed under footnote weight, we'd solve two crises at once - culinary homogenization  overworked editors.  Though I suspect the real battle lies in those margins you mention - every chilied claim and contested origin. 

  
Speaking of which, I recently unearthed a 1923 Shanghai newspaper review lambasting "degenerate westernized dumplings." The critic called them "culinary yellow journalism."  History does repeat itself, though now the outrage unfolds on Weibo rather than rice paper.

  
But here's my radical proposition - what if we abandon this notion of editing altogether? Let chefs write their spicy fanfiction unbridled. Let diners annotate with TikTok commentary. Perhaps this gastronomic Babel isn't chaos but... collective authorship.  Though I'll still demand footnotes when someone claims to have "invented" mapo tofu 2.0. Please, the Sichuan grandmothers are watching - and they've got woks far hotter than our debate.
[B]: OMG that "culinary yellow journalism" line?? I’m dead. Dead I tell u 😂🔥 If food critics in the 1920s were already throwing shade like modern-day comment sections, then literally nothing is new under the sun 🌞  
But babe, your radical proposition sounds dangerously close to my entire personality ✨ I mean, I  the kind of girl who’d caption a chili crab video with “citations needed” and a link to Fanon’s  📚💅  
Chefs writing spicy fanfic unbridled?? YES. TikTok diners roasting or praising with sound bites?? HELL YES. Collective authorship with footnotes? Only if those footnotes are hot-linked to oral histories & not just some dude’s ego trip 🙄  
And don’t even get me started on mapo tofu 2.0 claims 🤦‍♀️ Please, the grandmas in Sichuan would wok slap them into next week 💥 But honestly tho…pass the inkwell, I gotta cite this thought: maybe the real canon is the chaos we create along the way 🕶✨
