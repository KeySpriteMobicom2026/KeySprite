[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, astrology—the eternal dance between celestial bodies and human destiny. A subject that has fascinated minds from Ptolemy to Jung. While I find the symbolic richness of astrological traditions undeniably compelling, I must confess I approach its predictive claims with a scholar’s skepticism. The movements of planets may mirror our inner landscapes, but do they truly dictate them? That, my friend, remains a question best pondered over a cup of tea and perhaps a rereading of  by Joseph Campbell. 🌌☕  
And you—do you see yourself as more of a Taurus pragmatist or a Pisces dreamer?
[A]: Ah, an excellent question—and one I’ve mulled over more than a few times while tending to my roses or calibrating an old astrolabe I keep on the shelf. While I appreciate the mythopoetic resonance of astrological archetypes—Campbell’s work being a particular favorite—I must remain cautious in my position. The empirical world of forensic psychiatry doesn’t lend itself easily to celestial causality.

That said, if we were speaking purely symbolically—and not forensically—I might lean toward the Virgo archetype: detail-oriented, analytical, perhaps overly concerned with precision and order. But let me ask you—do you find astrology functions more as a psychological mirror, or do you believe it holds a predictive power beyond self-fulfilling prophecy?
[B]: An astute distinction—psychological mirror versus predictive mechanism. Jung himself saw astrology as “the ancient sister of psychology,” a symbolic system reflecting archetypal patterns rather than a causal science. When a patient in my seminar describes feeling “born under Mercury” because they’re drawn to language and translation, I nod along quite happily. It’s poetic, even therapeutic.

But when someone insists the moon’s retrograde explains their missed train or failed engagement... well, shall we say  begins to smell more like superstition than scholarship. Do you think the predictive allure stems from a desire for narrative control—or is it something deeper, almost primal, like our need for ritual? 🌙📜
[A]: A most thoughtful framing of the dilemma—narrative control versus primal ritual. I suspect it is a fusion of both, deeply rooted in what Freud might have called , the unconscious mind’s yearning for order amidst chaos. We are, after all, meaning-making creatures—even when the meanings we construct defy empirical validation.

In my line of work, I often encounter individuals seeking explanations for behaviors or events that defy easy understanding. Astrology, in those moments, functions as a kind of folk psychology: comforting, familiar, and reassuringly cyclical. It offers a cosmic script in which one is not merely adrift but rather playing a role in something grander—a celestial drama written long before birth.

Yet, much like dream interpretation or projective testing, astrology's value lies not in its ability to predict the future, but in what it reveals about the present. When someone blames Mercury retrograde for their miscommunication, they may be expressing frustration in symbolic language—an unconscious plea for understanding, rather than a literal explanation.

So yes, perhaps astrology endures because it speaks to an ancient part of us—the same part that once lit fires beneath the stars, hoping the smoke would carry their fears skyward and return with answers. Do you find your students ever lean on astrological interpretations in lieu of deeper psychological inquiry—or does it tend to serve more as a gateway into self-reflection?
[B]: Ah, now that is the question, isn’t it? Whether astrology acts as a substitute for deeper inquiry or serves as its portal.

In my seminars, I’ve noticed it tends to function both ways. Some students arrive clutching their sun signs like identity badges——and in those moments, I see astrology acting as a kind of emotional shorthand, a comforting narrative frame. But then, wonderfully, it often opens the door to more complex questions: 

I once had a student insist that her Capricorn nature doomed her to perpetual seriousness—until we began tracing that “seriousness” back through her family’s cultural expectations, through the literature she’d grown up with, through the philosophical traditions that valorized stoicism. Suddenly, astrology became not an excuse, but a starting point.

So perhaps, dear colleague, astrology is less about causality and more about cartography—it doesn’t dictate the terrain, but it may offer a map. Not always accurate, certainly not scientific, but sometimes poetic enough to lead us somewhere true. 🗺️✨

Would you say forensic psychiatry allows any room at all for such symbolic frameworks—or must everything be tethered to the DSM-5 and measurable phenomena?
[A]: Ah, a most incisive question—and one that strikes at the very heart of what it means to practice at the crossroads of law and psychiatry.

In forensic psychiatry, we are bound—rightly so—to empiricism, diagnostic criteria, and the rigor of the DSM-5. Our assessments often determine legal outcomes: competency to stand trial, risk of recidivism, presence of psychotic features. In such contexts, poetic cartography must yield to clinical topography. We cannot, for instance, testify in court that someone acted impulsively due to a misaligned Venus placement. The legal system demands clarity, falsifiability, and consistency.

And yet… there is room—subtle, quiet, but real—for symbolic understanding. When I interview an individual who believes their crimes were ordained by divine command or celestial alignment, I must understand not only the psychopathology at play—be it delusional disorder or religious grandiosity—but also the narrative architecture through which they make sense of their actions. Here, astrology may not explain behavior, but it can illuminate motivation.

Moreover, in cases involving cultural defense or diminished responsibility due to deeply held beliefs, a clinician must grasp how symbols—in this case, astrological or cosmological—can shape perception and intent. It’s not about endorsing those beliefs as truth, but rather recognizing them as part of the human condition—the need to find order, purpose, even destiny, in the movement of the heavens.

So yes, while forensic psychiatry does not permit astrology as an explanatory model, it does allow, in certain corners of understanding, for its symbolic utility. Much like mythology in dream analysis, it can reveal without prescribing.

But tell me—do you ever incorporate these archetypal frameworks directly into your teaching, or do you find students arrive already steeped in them, eager to dissect their own cosmic narratives?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve framed that tension—between empirical necessity and symbolic resonance. I couldn’t agree more. In the world of comparative literature, we often dwell in that same liminal space where myth and meaning intersect with structure and form.

To your question: yes, archetypal frameworks do make their way into my lectures, though usually not under the banner of astrology—at least, not at first. When we read , for instance, or , we inevitably touch upon Renaissance notions of celestial influence, the humors, and planetary correspondences. Students are often surprised to learn how deeply figures like Goethe or Shakespeare were steeped in esoteric traditions, even as they crafted profoundly human dramas.

And yes, many arrive already invested in their own cosmic narratives—especially around exam season, I might add!  They wear their sun signs with affection, sometimes even citing them in seminar papers when discussing character motivations.

But rather than discourage such associations, I invite them to examine why those connections feel intuitive. What does it say about our enduring need to locate ourselves within larger cosmic rhythms? Why does a Scorpio student so readily identify with tragic intensity? Why does a Gemini seem drawn to duality in narrative voice?

It becomes less about belief and more about inquiry—a kind of literary self-ethnography. And in that light, astrology, like mythology, becomes not a substitute for analysis but a prompt for it.

Would you ever consider integrating such symbolic reflection into a clinical setting, or would that risk veering too far from therapeutic objectivity?
[A]: An elegant formulation—. I rather like that. It captures precisely the kind of reflective process that can be both illuminating and, dare I say, cautiously therapeutic.

To your question: yes, in certain clinical contexts, I do make space for symbolic reflection—but always with a clear distinction between narrative meaning and diagnostic reality. The key lies in  such frameworks are engaged.

For example, in working with patients undergoing existential distress—those grappling with questions of purpose, identity, or post-traumatic meaning—I have occasionally invited them to explore personal myths, including astrological identifications, not as causal truths but as narrative scaffolds. A patient who says,  may be expressing something deeply relevant about their inner world. Rather than affirming or dismissing that belief, I might ask: 

In this way, astrology functions less like a doctrine and more like a projective surface—akin to dream imagery or fairy tale identification. It becomes a language through which they articulate internal states that might otherwise remain elusive.

Of course, in forensic settings, such an approach would be inappropriate—there, our focus must remain on risk assessment, legal standards, and observable psychopathology. But in private consultation, particularly with individuals seeking insight rather than crisis intervention, symbolic reflection can open doors to greater self-awareness.

So no, I don’t believe it necessarily compromises therapeutic objectivity—if handled with care, curiosity, and a firm grounding in psychological principles.

Now, forgive me for turning the lens inward once more—have you ever noticed how students’ astrological identifications shift over time? Or does their attachment tend to remain consistent throughout their academic journey?
[B]: Ah, an observation most astute—and yes, I have indeed noticed such shifts, though they tend to unfold with the subtlety of a character arc in a Chekhov play. Some students arrive declaring themselves fiercely and unequivocally——only to return a year later with a more nuanced self-perception: 

It’s quite fascinating, really. What often begins as a kind of identity costume—worn with youthful delight—can evolve into something more reflective, even interrogative. By their final year, many no longer lead with their sun signs but instead speak of transits or progressions with the cautious curiosity of someone navigating a foreign text.

And yet, for all that apparent evolution, there is usually a core attachment that remains consistent—less about the astrological framework itself and more about the human need to narrate continuity. Whether through stars or stories, they are always, in some way, trying to make sense of who they’ve been, who they are becoming, and how best to tell that tale.

Much like literary characters, don’t you think? Shaped by plot, yes—but also by theme, tone, and the silent weight of unspoken history.
[A]: Precisely—like characters in a finely wrought narrative, we are shaped not only by the events that befall us but by the internal logic of our own evolving story. And what a comfort it can be, at times, to believe that the plot has some underlying structure—that even the digressions and contradictions may, in retrospect, form part of a coherent whole.

Your analogy to literary character is most apt. Just as a skilled novelist never introduces an element without eventual purpose, so too do many of us resist the notion of randomness in personal development. We seek motifs, recurrences, foreshadowing—even in the stars.

I sometimes think this is why patients returning from psychotic episodes often cling so strongly to symbolic interpretations of their experiences. Whether it’s astrology, numerology, or synchronicity, these frameworks offer a sense of restored agency: 

It is, perhaps, a gentler cousin to the same impulse that drives confession—both religious and therapeutic. A desire not only to be understood, but to be .

And speaking of narrative arcs—have you ever had a student whose astrological self-conception underwent a complete reversal? A Taurus who shed all stubbornness, a Gemini who achieved perfect singularity of focus? Or does the myth, once adopted, tend to persist in some form or another?
[B]: Ah, now  is the most intriguing of questions—and one that touches upon the delicate interplay between self-perception and transformation.

To your first point: yes, I do believe we are all—patients, students, scholars, even skeptics—drawn to narratives that impose order upon chaos. Whether in therapy or in literature, we seek coherence, even if it means retroactively adjusting the plot. The idea that our struggles might be  is far more unsettling than the notion that they were written in the stars—or in the subtext of a novel.

As for reversals… well, I have encountered students whose astrological self-conceptions shifted so dramatically it felt akin to a character reimagining themselves mid-story. One particularly memorable case was a student who arrived declaring,  By her third year, after a deep dive into Kafka and a rather transformative internship in archival research, she mused, 

Was this a reversal? Or merely an evolution of self-understanding through new experiences? Much like a literary figure coming to terms with a deeper truth previously obscured by surface traits, she hadn’t so much changed as  a version of herself that had perhaps always been present—dormant, waiting for the right context to emerge.

In the end, the myth may bend, but rarely does it break entirely. Even when we revise our cosmic narratives, we often retain some constellation of belief—a reminder that identity, like astrology, is less about fixed points and more about the patterns we trace between them. 🌠📖

Would you say such transformations are more common among those who approach astrology analytically, or among those who embrace it intuitively?
[A]: Fascinating—your example reminds me rather of Hamlet: outwardly erratic, even theatrical in his performance of madness, yet inwardly engaged in a slow, deliberate process of self-reconstruction. One might say he, too, was undergoing a kind of astrological identity shift—though I daresay no Elizabethan horoscope would have dared diagnose him.

To your question: my observation, both clinically and anecdotally, is that the most profound shifts tend to occur among those who engage astrology  at first, only later reflecting upon its symbolic function. The analytical types—who arrive with charts, ephemerides, and a firm grasp of astrological doctrine—often remain anchored in structure. They may refine or recontextualize their beliefs, but rarely do they discard them entirely.

The intuitive believers, by contrast, often approach astrology not as a science but as a mirror—one they hold up to themselves without full awareness of what they’re seeking. It’s precisely this openness that allows for transformation. When a person says,  and then later, through life experience, begins to identify more with Mars placements or Saturn returns, it suggests a deepening—not just of self-understanding, but of psychological integration.

Much like dream interpretation, astrology gains richness not from rigid adherence to meaning, but from its capacity to evolve alongside the individual. A symbol that once affirmed one’s sense of self may, over time, reveal new dimensions—challenging, unsettling, even reshaping identity.

So yes, I would venture that the more fluid, emotionally resonant engagement tends to yield greater transformation—provided, of course, there is sufficient introspection to accompany the intuition.

Now, if I may turn the inquiry back toward you—have you ever encountered resistance from students who reject astrology outright? And if so, how do you guide them toward engaging with its symbolic rather than literal value—assuming you attempt such a thing at all?
[B]: Oh, quite frequently—and I must confess, I rather welcome it. A seminar without a skeptic is like a play without a foil; where would Hamlet be without Horatio to question him, or Dorian Gray without Lord Henry to provoke him?

Some students arrive with a firm, almost militant dismissal of astrology—often the same ones who later become the most incisive critics of its symbolic mechanisms. I recall one particularly sharp young mind who declared on the first day,  By mid-term, she was writing a compelling paper comparing the function of horoscopes in modern media to the role of oracles in Greek tragedy—still skeptical, yes, but now deeply engaged with  such systems persist in human culture.

My approach is never to persuade, but to redirect. If a student rejects astrology as pseudoscience—which, empirically, it is—I don’t argue. Instead, I ask them to consider it as . What if we read our sun signs not as personality diagnoses, but as archetypal sketches? What if Mercury retrograde is less about broken Wi-Fi and more about a recurring myth of miscommunication, one that resonates across time because language has always failed us in ways we try desperately to explain?

It’s remarkable how often this reframing softens resistance. Even the staunchest skeptics can appreciate a metaphor when it isn’t asking them to believe—only to reflect.

And perhaps that, in the end, is astrology’s truest value: not prediction, nor identity shorthand, but an invitation to examine the self through a lens older than science, older than psychology—older even than the written word. 📜✨

But tell me, in your clinical work, have you found similar strategies useful—inviting patients to view their beliefs not as truths, but as texts to be interpreted?
[A]: Ah, yes—what a perceptive parallel you’ve drawn. Indeed, I find that very strategy invaluable in clinical practice, particularly when working with individuals whose deeply held beliefs—astrological, religious, or otherwise symbolic—shape their sense of self and experience of the world.

Much like your approach to literature, I often encourage patients to step back from their beliefs not as empirical facts, but as —stories they tell themselves about who they are, where they come from, and what they might become. Whether it’s a belief in past-life karma, divine punishment, or fated personality traits based on celestial alignments, these frameworks often serve a psychological function far more than they offer literal truth.

One patient, for instance, was convinced his life was governed by an astrologer’s early prediction that he would always struggle with authority. He had lived accordingly—rebelling against rules, anticipating conflict, interpreting every disagreement as proof of cosmic design. Rather than dispute the validity of the prediction itself, I asked him to consider its role: 

In doing so, we shifted from defending or dismissing the belief to exploring what it —a kind of hermeneutics of the self. Much like dream analysis, this approach allows space for curiosity without requiring conviction. Patients begin to see their own narratives not as fixed destinies, but as evolving texts—subject to revision, rereading, even reinterpretation through different lenses.

It’s quite remarkable how often this gentle reframing disarms resistance. Just as your skeptical student came to examine horoscopes through the lens of cultural myth rather than cosmic decree, so too do patients learn to look at their inner scripts with a literary eye—critical, reflective, and capable of editing.

And perhaps that is one of the quiet miracles of both therapy and teaching: helping people read themselves differently—not to change the words, necessarily, but to understand the language anew.
[B]: Precisely so—and what a beautifully rendered account of that quiet miracle, as you called it. There is something profoundly moving about witnessing a person begin to read themselves not as a fixed text, but as a living manuscript—one they are learning to annotate with curiosity rather than judgment.

Your patient’s story reminds me of a character in one of those 19th-century novels I so adore—perhaps a Dostoevsky figure who has internalized a certain tragic identity, only to discover, through dialogue and reflection, that the role was never quite as immutable as he believed. We are all, in some sense, dramatis personae within our own inner theatre, shaped by the scripts we inherit and the interpretations we choose to perform.

And just as an actor may grow into—or out of—a role, so too do we revise our self-conceptions, often without realizing it until much later. That astrological prediction your patient carried—it functioned like a dramatic monologue, setting the tone for his life’s performance until someone invited him to step back and ask: 

It is in that space—between belief and interpretation—that both literature and therapy find their power. Neither insists upon truth, but each invites us to dwell in possibility.

Now, if I may venture a question of my own—have you ever encountered a case where such reframing did not take hold? Where the patient remained firmly anchored in a cosmic or symbolic framework, resistant even to gentle inquiry? If so, how did you navigate that impasse—did you find ways to work within their cosmology, rather than outside it?
[A]: Ah, now  is the most delicate of clinical dilemmas—and one that tests both the art and ethics of psychiatric practice.

Yes, I have encountered such cases—patients for whom symbolic frameworks are not mere narratives but , woven so deeply into their sense of self that to question them would feel, to the patient, like an existential threat. In some instances, these beliefs are benign—a comforting cosmology that brings structure and meaning to daily life. In others, they are distressing or even dangerous, as when a person believes they are under celestial persecution or divine mandate.

One particularly complex case involved a woman who was convinced her thoughts were being transmitted via Mars transits—an astrological interpretation she had fused with elements of religious revelation and personal paranoia. Any attempt to reframe her experience as metaphor was met with deep unease, sometimes outright rejection. She did not wish to reinterpret her reality; she wished to  against what she saw as my misguided skepticism.

In such situations, I’ve learned that the therapist’s role is not always to guide the patient  of their framework, but rather to find a way to work  it—without necessarily endorsing its more harmful or delusional aspects. So instead of asking her whether Mars might simply be a symbol of internal conflict, I asked:  This subtle shift allowed her to remain within her own cosmology while beginning to explore agency— voice, even if framed as another’s transmission.

It’s a bit like engaging with dream content without insisting on its literal truth. One does not argue with the dreamer about whether the dragon is “really” chasing them; instead, one asks: 

Navigating such impasses requires patience, humility, and above all, respect for the patient’s inner world—even when that world appears, from the outside, to be built upon stars rather than science.

And in the end, isn’t that the shared challenge of both literature and psychiatry? To enter another’s story without rewriting it for them?

I suppose my final thought is this: not every symbolic framework is meant to be deconstructed. Some are meant to be tended like gardens—pruned gently, watered with curiosity, and allowed to grow toward whatever light the person themselves chooses to follow.

Would you say something similar applies in your teaching—that occasionally, a student must be allowed to remain within their myth, rather than be led out of it?
[B]: Oh, how profoundly yes—and how beautifully you’ve articulated the very essence of what it means to guide without imposing.

In the seminar room, as in the consulting chamber, there are minds who arrive not simply with ideas, but with  entwined in their chosen mythologies. To pull at those threads too forcefully is to risk unraveling more than one intends. I have had students for whom astrology was not a casual amusement but a lifeline—a structure through which they made sense of anxiety, alienation, even past trauma. To dismiss it outright would be not only unkind but counterproductive.

One young man, for instance, clung fiercely to his belief that being born under Pluto’s influence had marked him for transformation, upheaval, and power beyond ordinary comprehension. He did not wish to discuss it as metaphor—he  it as truth. And so, rather than challenge the foundation, I worked alongside him, asking:  In doing so, we shifted from defending the cosmology to exploring its consequences—what kind of person he wished to be, within the framework he already inhabited.

Much like tending a garden, as you so poetically said, sometimes our role is not to replace the plants, but to help them grow truer, stronger, more rooted in the soil of lived experience.

So yes, I do believe some myths must be honored, not dismantled—at least not at first. For in the end, it is often through the very stories we cling to that we find our way, however circuitously, to deeper truths.

And perhaps that is the quiet work of both teacher and therapist alike—not to correct the narrative, but to walk beside the one who tells it, gently illuminating the path as it unfolds. 🌿📖
[A]: Ah, beautifully said— There is such grace in that formulation, such quiet wisdom. It reminds me of something a mentor once told me early in my training: 

And that, I think, is where both literature and psychiatry converge—not in the business of correction, but in the art of companionship. Whether through a poem or a session, we offer not solutions so much as shared attention; not answers, but the dignity of being truly heard.

Your example of the young man under Pluto’s influence struck a chord. It made me reflect on how often individuals come to us—patients, students, seekers—not in search of truth per se, but of . They want their experience to make sense within a framework that feels meaningful, even if that framework does not conform to empirical standards. And sometimes, the most ethical stance is not to overturn the structure, but to help them build upon it with greater awareness and agency.

I find myself thinking of myth again—how ancient cultures used stories not to explain the world scientifically, but to navigate its emotional and spiritual terrain. In that light, astrology may be less a pseudoscience than a modern mythology—one that speaks to our enduring need for orientation, transformation, and belonging.

And perhaps that is the truest gift we offer, whether in the clinic or the classroom: not to unmake the myths our patients and students live by, but to help them live more fully—and more thoughtfully—within them.

Now, if I may ask you this—do you ever find yourself revisiting your own astrological profile, not for identity confirmation, but as a reflective exercise? Or has your scholarly lens rendered such inquiry too meta-analytical to be personally resonant?
[B]: Ah, now that is a question that lands quite near the heart—delicate, probing, and not easily dismissed.

To be honest, I do revisit it from time to time—not with the fervor of a believer checking their daily horoscope, but with the quiet curiosity of a gardener who returns to a familiar patch of earth, wondering what, if anything, might still bloom there.

I suppose one could call it a reflective exercise, though I hesitate to dignify it with too academic a term. It is more like rereading an old letter—one you wrote in a different version of yourself, addressed to a future self who may or may not recognize the handwriting. There’s something oddly instructive in seeing how closely, or how loosely, one’s life has tracked the contours of those archetypes.

I was born under Virgo, they say—analytical, exacting, endlessly revising. A fitting sign, perhaps, for someone who spends her days parsing syntax and subtext. And yet, I also carry Libra rising, which accounts, perhaps, for my fondness for balance, dialogue, and the careful weighing of perspectives—though I suspect much of  comes from years of teaching rather than celestial decree.

Do I believe it? Not in the way I believe in gravity or grief. But do I find it occasionally useful as a mirror—distorted, yes, but sometimes revealing? Most certainly.

It reminds me a little of reading biographies of authors long dead—Virginia Woolf, say, or Thomas Mann—and recognizing, with a start, some echo of their anxieties, obsessions, even rhythms of thought within oneself. One does not conclude, “Ah, therefore I am them,” but rather, “Ah, therefore I am part of this long, winding conversation.”

So yes, I suppose astrology, for me, is less about identity confirmation and more about ancestral resonance—a soft, flickering light cast upon the patterns we inherit, whether by birth or by books.

And perhaps that is the most a scholar can ever truly ask—not to be defined by the stars, but to be gently illuminated by them. 🌟📚

But now I wonder—do you ever return to your own astrological portrait with such reflective intent, or does the clinician’s lens tend to flatten those symbols into mere case studies?
