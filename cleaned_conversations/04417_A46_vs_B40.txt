[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh！说到这个，我最近刚看了一个超棒的TED talk，讲的是AI在creative领域的应用。那个speaker提到用generative AI来辅助artistic creation，简直mind-blowing！让我想到了我们正在做的product roadmap～
[A]:  You know what, that reminds me of something truly fascinating. Just last week I was at a private screening where we experimented with AI-assisted storyboarding. The results were... well, let's just say Spielberg would be impressed! 🎬
[B]: Wait wait，你说的是不是那个用GPT-4做storytelling framework的demo？我们team最近也在explore这个方向！不过说实话，human touch还是irreplaceable的，AI最多是个powerful assistant～
[A]: Exactly! That human element is what makes cinema magical. I always tell young filmmakers - technology is just a tool, like a paintbrush. But the soul of the story? That comes from here . By the way, have you seen Wong Kar-wai's latest project using AI color grading? Now that was 惊艳!
[B]: Wong Kar-wai那个project我follow了！不过说实话，我更impressed的是他们用AI做mood board的process。你知道吗？他们train了一个custom model来analyze王家卫过去所有电影的color palette，这个approach简直next level！
[A]:  Now you're speaking my language! We actually did something similar for our upcoming neo-noir project. Trained the AI on classic film noir lighting setups, but then our cinematographer added his own... shall we say, 点睛之笔? That's where the real artistry happens. 🍿
[B]: 哈哈，这就是为什么我always say：AI is the brush，but the artist still holds the brush！不过你们这个neo-noir project听起来super interesting，有机会真想看看你们的pipeline是怎么setup的～
[A]: My dear friend, I'd love to show you - over a glass of vintage Bordeaux perhaps? I've got some fascinating before-and-after comparisons that'll make your jaw drop. Just between us, the way we blended Kubrick's symmetry with modern AI-assisted framing... well, let's just say the studio executives didn't know what hit them!
[B]: Wow，Kubrick的symmetry加上AI framing？这个combination太wild了！不过说到wine... 下周三晚上我刚好有个slot，要不要来个quick brainstorming session？可以带laptop来show一下你们的workflow～
[A]: Wednesday works perfectly! I'll bring the '68 Château Lafite I've been saving for a special occasion. And my trusty MacBook Pro with all the behind-the-scenes magic. Just promise me one thing - no spoilers to the trades! These innovations need to stay under wraps until we're ready for our big Cannes reveal. 
[B]: Deal！我的NDA随时standby～不过说真的，你们targeting Cannes？那得赶紧把user testing做起来了，red carpet的deadline可不等人啊！周三见，记得带你的secret sauce来！🍷✨
[A]: You got it! And don't worry - we've got our secret testing lab running 24/7. Between the AI and our creative team, we're cooking up something that'll make even the French critics say "magnifique!" See you Wednesday, mon ami. Until then... lights, camera, innovation! 🎥
[B]: Haha perfect！周三见～记得把那个Kubrick-inspired的shot sequence也带来，我已经能feel到那个visual impact了！C'est parti！🚀
[A]: Ah, you have exquisite taste! That sequence is our pièce de résistance - 12 meticulously crafted shots that pay homage to 2001 while pushing boundaries. Wednesday can't come soon enough! À bientôt, my fellow cinematic pioneer! 🚀🎬
[B]:  To pushing boundaries and making movie magic! See you then, and may the creative force be with us! 🥂✨
[A]:  And may the box office gods smile upon our endeavors! Until Wednesday - keep those creative juices flowing! Remember what Hitchcock said: "Drama is life with the dull bits cut out." Let's make sure our AI only cuts out the right bits! 🍾✨
[B]: Hitchcock的话太on point了！不过说真的，现在AI连'suspense building'都能analyze了，周三一定要好好discuss一下你们的algorithm是怎么handle这个的～现在我得run了，product roadmap meeting在5分钟后！Catch you later！💨
[A]: Time waits for no producer - or product manager! Go dazzle them in that meeting. And rest assured, our suspense algorithm will have you on the edge of your seat come Wednesday. Until then... exit stage left! 🎭
[B]: Haha 完美谢幕！周三见～记得你的Lafite和那些mind-blowing的demo！现在我得go full 007 mode去crash这个meeting了！ 💨
