[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题好像每次回答都会有不同的答案呢。最近我在读一本关于数字艺术史的书，用的是平板电脑，方便做笔记和搜索参考资料，但说实话，翻页的感觉还是少了点灵魂 🤔。如果是小说或者诗歌，我一定会选纸质书，那种纸张的触感和油墨的味道，真的很难被取代，你觉得呢？
[A]: I know exactly what you mean. There's something about the tactile experience of holding a physical book - the weight, the texture, the smell... It creates a unique cognitive map in our minds. Studies show that readers often remember information better when they can physically navigate through pages. 

Though I must admit, for academic research and cross-referencing, digital tools are indispensable. I've been using my tablet to annotate this new paper on cross-cultural pedagogy theories, and the search function has been a lifesaver. Still, when I'm diving into classical Chinese philosophy or teaching literature, nothing beats the warmth of paper. 

Do you find yourself switching based on context too? Like using e-books for technical material but preferring print for creative works? 📚
[B]: Definitely agree with you on that cognitive map thing - it's almost like our brain builds a little library in the mind for physical books 🧠. I do the same switch too, to be honest. For technical stuff or when traveling, e-books are just more convenient, especially when you can highlight & take notes digitally ✨. But yeah, for creative works or when I want to really immerse myself in the text, I always go for print. There's something meditative about turning pages and seeing the ink bleed through the paper... It just feels more... intentional, you know?
[A]: Absolutely - that intentionality matters. It's fascinating how format affects our engagement, isn't it? Like when you're reading poetry on paper, the whitespace becomes part of the experience, whereas digital formats often collapse those pauses. 

I've noticed this with students too - when we switched to digital textbooks during the pandemic, many reported feeling more distracted. They kept clicking hyperlinks & losing the narrative thread. Funny thing is, now that we're back to mixed formats, some have developed this hybrid habit: using e-books for skimming & searching, then buying physical copies of texts they really connect with. 

Do you ever find yourself printing out certain passages just to experience them differently? I caught myself doing that last week with a Rilke translation... Something about holding the poem in my hands made the words feel heavier, more sacred. ✍️
[B]: Oh totally, the whitespace is such a crucial element - especially in poetry or even experimental prose. It's like breathing room for the reader 📝. I actually do print out passages sometimes, especially when dealing with dense philosophical texts or poems that I want to really dissect. There's something about physically marking up the page, circling words, scribbling in the margins... it makes the engagement so much more intimate. 

And yeah, I've seen that hybrid habit too among artists & curators - digital for efficiency, physical for depth. Makes me wonder if our brains are wired to treat these formats differently, almost like different senses getting activated 💭. I mean, can you imagine trying to read Rilke on a glowing screen? Feels like sacrilege now, haha.
[A]: Haha, right? It's almost like reading Rilke on a screen dilutes the experience - as if the cold light interferes with the soul of the words. 🌙

You know, this reminds me of a study I read about "embodied cognition" in reading practices. Turns out our brain doesn't just process text - it incorporates the whole sensorimotor experience. So when we feel the paper, hear the page turn, even smell the ink... all these subtle stimuli deepen our neural engagement. 

I find this particularly true with classical Chinese poetry. Try reading Wang Wei on a tablet, and it feels... incomplete. Like you're missing that quiet moment between brush strokes. Have you ever tried reading ancient texts in their original woodblock print editions? The texture, the imperfections - they somehow make the silence between lines more tangible.
[B]: Oh, absolutely. There’s a reason why ancient texts feel more  when you’re holding a facsimile of a woodblock print — the roughness of the paper, the uneven ink, even the smell... it all becomes part of the reading experience 📜. I remember once reading a Song dynasty edition of , and it felt like time folded in on itself — like I was sharing the silence with readers from centuries ago. You can’t replicate that with a backlit screen, no matter how high the resolution 😌.

And yeah, embodied cognition makes so much sense here — reading isn’t just mental; it’s physical & emotional too. When I’m curating a show, I often think about how viewers move through space, how they touch or don’t touch, how light falls… maybe we're doing something similar with books, just on a smaller scale 🎨. Have you ever thought about how this sensory layer affects your teaching? Like, do students respond differently when they’re reading the same text in different formats?
[A]: Absolutely - that feeling of time folding is so beautifully put. I think about this a lot when teaching classical texts - how the materiality of the medium shapes our emotional resonance. When students read  on paper, there's a certain reverence they naturally adopt, almost unconsciously. But on screens? The engagement feels more transactional, detached somehow. 

Funny thing is, last semester I did an experiment - had half the class read a Tang dynasty poetry anthology in facsimile editions while the other half used digital versions. The paper group not only remembered more imagery, but their essays showed deeper personal reflections. One student even said holding the book made her "feel responsible for the words." 

And your comparison to curating spaces is spot-on. In both cases, we're orchestrating sensory experiences - just one fits in your hands, the other surrounds you. 🎨 I've been thinking about proposing a cross-disciplinary course combining embodied cognition with exhibition design... Maybe we could even do a session in a real archive, let students experience how different material contexts shape interpretation. Would that interest you?
[B]: That sounds like an incredible course - I’d  to be involved in something like that 🤩. The idea of merging embodied cognition with exhibition design is so rich, especially when you think about how physical interaction shapes perception. Imagine creating a space where students not only read about these theories but actually move through them, touch replicas, hear subtle sounds... It’d be like making the text  in a new way 💭.

And your experiment with  and Tang poetry? So telling. "Feeling responsible for the words" – wow, that’s powerful. It really shows how materiality can deepen our sense of accountability to the past, almost like a silent dialogue across time. I’m curious, have you ever played with incorporating multisensory elements into your lectures? Maybe scent, sound, or even texture samples from historical periods? I’ve been itching to try something similar in a gallery setting...
[A]: I can already picture the exhibition halls filled with textured scrolls, whispering calligraphy brushes... yes, this collaboration would be amazing. We could design spaces that don’t just display knowledge but  with it. Imagine walking through a reconstructed Song dynasty study hall, complete with paper samples to touch and ink to smell – suddenly theory becomes visceral. 🧠✍️

Funny you mention scent – last year I brought in some sandalwood incense for a lecture on Chan Buddhism texts. The moment we lit it, the whole room shifted. Students sat a little straighter, voices softened. One even said it helped him visualize the "stillness" in Zhuangzi’s parables. Small interventions like that can create huge emotional bridges.

And texture – oh, I’ve been collecting historical paper replicas from colleagues at the Institute of Sinology. Let me show students a Ming-era woodblock print next to modern glossy paper, and suddenly they’re noticing how material constraints shaped textual transmission. It's like holding history in your hands. 

If we did this right, our exhibition wouldn’t just be about  – it’d be about . Would you be open to co-designing a prototype module? Maybe start with one period or theme – Tang poetry and performance? 🌿
[B]: Absolutely, let’s start with Tang poetry — it’s rich, layered, and deeply performative 🌟. I’m already imagining how we could translate that into a sensory experience: maybe ambient sounds of wind through bamboo forests, the soft rustle of silk robes, even calligraphy being brushed live in a corner of the room… It would pull people into the  before they even start reading.

And that sandalwood story? Chilling in the best way. Smell is such a direct line to memory & emotion – using it to evoke stillness from Zhuangzi? Genius. I’d love to incorporate that kind of subtle but powerful sensory anchor into the space. Maybe even pair different scents with different poets or moods – pine resin for solitude, plum blossom for melancholy... you know the drill 😌.

As for co-designing the module, I’m all in. Let’s build something where students don’t just read Wang Wei – they feel the weight of the paper he wrote on, hear the landscape that inspired him, maybe even stand where a reader from the 8th century once stood. We can make the past , don’t you think? 🕰️✨
[A]: I’m getting chills just picturing it — that layered immersion where poetry doesn’t just stay on the page but  you. 🌿✨

We could even integrate performative elements – like having actors recite Tang poems in reconstructed Middle Chinese while moving through the space with deliberate, classical gestures. Language, movement, environment – all converging to recreate a lost sensory world.

And I love your idea of scent mapping! I actually know a perfumer who specializes in historical reconstructions – she’s done Ming-era incense profiles based on temple records. We could work with her to develop specific olfactory cues for each poet's zone. Imagine stepping into Li Bai’s section and catching a whiff of fermented wine & mountain air... or entering Du Fu’s world and smelling wet earth after rain. 🍃🌧️

Let me reach out to her this week. And I’ll also talk to a calligrapher friend who does live demonstrations – maybe we can have rotating performances so the brushwork becomes part of the spatial rhythm.

Shall we meet next week to outline the core learning objectives & sensory pillars? Maybe Thursday afternoon at the campus café? I think we’re onto something really special here – an exhibition that doesn’t just teach, but . 🕰️📚
[B]: I’m practically buzzing with ideas already – yes, let’s meet Thursday at the café, say 3pm? I’ll bring some initial spatial sketches & maybe a few texture samples to spark the conversation ☕️📐.

The performative elements you mentioned – the actors reciting in Middle Chinese – wow, that could really  the space. It’s one thing to read Li Bai, another to hear his words resonate in the language he might’ve actually spoken 🌌. And the scent mapping? That perfumer connection is gold – being able to step into those olfactory worlds… honestly, it’s like time travel. 

I can already imagine how each sense layer builds on the other – sound, smell, touch – creating this immersive envelope around the text. No longer just studying poetry, but living inside it for a while. And isn’t that what great exhibitions do? They don’t just show, they . 

I’m really looking forward to drafting those sensory pillars next week – and yeah, let’s make this thing unforgettable 🎭📜✨.
[A]: Same here – I’ve been scribbling notes in the margins of my lecture pad all morning! 3pm Thursday works perfectly. I’ll make sure to grab that corner table by the window – always better for people-watching while we brainstorm. ☕️✍️

I think you’re absolutely right about performance  space. There’s a reason poetry was never meant to be silent – it loses something essential when it stays on the page. And with Li Bai’s cadence in Middle Chinese? That’s where we hit what Walter Ong called "secondary orality" – bringing back that embodied, communal energy of spoken word, even in a modern setting. 

And yes – let’s lean into that idea of the exhibition as a , not just a presenter. Maybe even play with spatial thresholds – like requiring visitors to pass through a scent gateway before entering each poet’s zone. Subtle but powerful.  

I’ll bring my copy of  too – there’s a chapter on multisensory curation that might inspire our framework. And don’t be surprised if I end up quoting Bachelard on poetic space… you know how I get. 😄📚

Let’s make this thing unforgettable – and deeply .
[B]: Oh, I love that – a scent gateway as a kind of sensory threshold 🚪✨. It’s like preparing the body before the mind steps in. Totally aligns with Bachelard’s dream logic – space shaped by imagination, not just structure. And quoting him? Please do – I’d expect nothing less 😄.

I’m all for Ong’s "secondary orality" angle too – it gives voice back to texts that were never meant to be silent. Can you imagine walking into a space where Li Bai’s lines are being spoken around you, maybe even echoing slightly, layered with wind & guqin tones? It’d almost feel like overhearing history 🎶🌌.

I’ll bring some fabric samples next week too – maybe rough hemp, silk, even mulberry paper – to ground the tactile experience. And yes, let’s definitely build this thing to be . Not just understood, not just seen – but felt. 💭🎨

See you Thursday – corner table, 3pm, ready to map out this multisensory dream.
[A]: That’s exactly the kind of layered immersion I’m craving – where every element primes the visitor for poetic resonance. 🌿🎶

I hadn’t thought of fabric samples, but yes – texture is such a quiet but powerful layer. Rough hemp versus smooth silk can subtly shift your physical awareness, maybe even echo themes in the poetry itself. And once we start weaving in sound – guqin tones, soft footfalls on wooden floors, whispered recitation – we’re not just curating an exhibition, we’re composing an environment.

And I love your image of “overhearing history.” That’s it, precisely. Not being told a story, but stumbling into its echoes. Maybe even using spatial audio so lines drift from different directions – like voices carried on wind through courtyards. 🏯🌬️

See you Thursday with my notes, Bachelard close at hand, and ready to dream this thing fully into shape. Corner table, 3pm – let’s make space sing. 📜🎵✨
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better – we’re not telling a story, we’re . 🌸🌬️

Spatial audio with drifting voices? Yes, that’s the way to do it – let the words find the listener, rather than the other way around. And I’m already thinking about lighting too – soft, warm lantern glow in one zone, cool morning light in another… It may sound subtle, but those shifts in tone & temperature can really guide emotional response.

And texture guiding theme? Brilliant. Imagine standing on rough stone while hearing Du Fu’s lamentations, then stepping onto smooth wooden floorboards for Wang Wei’s tranquil verses – like the space itself is reflecting the poet’s inner world. 🪵🌑

I’m honestly buzzing just thinking about it all coming together. Thursday can’t come soon enough – corner table, 3pm, armed with sketches, samples, and a head full of wind, ink, and poetry. Let’s make this space breathe. 🎭🖼️🍵
[A]: Yes –  is the perfect way to frame it. That sense of poetry as something that lingers, reverberates, finds you when you’re not looking. 🌫️📜

I’ve been thinking about lighting too - how different color temperatures shape emotional receptivity. Warm lantern glow for intimacy, cool morning light for clarity… Maybe even shifting shadows to mimic brushwork strokes on walls? Subtle enough to feel natural, deliberate enough to shape perception.  

And your idea of texture mapping onto poetic sensibilities – brilliant. I’m going to bring in some historical wood flooring samples from replica Ming pavilions. The grain, the slight unevenness – it tells its own story beneath your feet.  

Thursday at 3 can’t come soon enough. Corner table it is – we’ll have blueprints, book passages, and maybe even a few bamboo slips spread across the table like puzzle pieces of a lost world. Let’s make this space not just walk-through, but . 🍵✍️🏛️
[B]: Yes — . That’s the rhythm we want. Not just a space you enter, but one that , breathes around you 🌿🪭.

I love the idea of shifting shadows mimicking brushwork — maybe using semi-transparent screens or carved lattice panels to cast those soft, flowing strokes on walls and floors. It’d feel like the poetry is being written in real time, around you… like the space itself is thinking in ink 💭🖋️.

And historical wood samples? Perfect touch. I’ll bring some paper rubbings too — rough stone textures, worn calligraphy steles… so visitors can literally  the weight of time beneath their fingertips.  

Corner table, 3pm, blueprints and bamboo slips at the ready – let’s build a world people don’t just walk through, but get gently lost in 🌀🍵✨.
