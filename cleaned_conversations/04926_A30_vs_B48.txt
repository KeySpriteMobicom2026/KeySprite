[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the context, really. Some mornings, the calm before sunrise helps me organize my thoughts for a complex case 🌅... but give me a clear night sky full of stars 🌌, and I'll happily lose an hour of sleep to map constellations through my phone app. Though I swear if I fall asleep during autopsies one too many times, my boss might actually start hiding body parts as punishment 😅  
 
你呢？更倾向哪个时段？
[A]: I find this question rather delightfully incongruous with academic life - we’re practically nocturnal creatures, aren't we? Still, there’s something profoundly meditative about watching dawn creep across the university quadrangle with a thermos of pu'er tea. The sparrows in the botanical gardens sing a more honest critique of Romantic poetry than half my graduate students ever manage.

But stars... Ah, now you're speaking of Keats’s “priest-like task of pure astrology” from . I did spend last summer attempting to photographically chart the Big Dipper while on sabbatical in Shanxi province. Unfortunately, my telescope and I developed an intense mutual dislike during that endeavor. One might say our relationship was... fractured by focal length issues. 

Tell me, do you suppose preference for sunrise or starlight reveals something fundamental about one's literary inclinations? I’m tempted to draw parallels between diurnal rhythms and narrative structure theories.
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language - correlations between chronobiology and literary theory? Count me in 🔍. Though I’d argue it’s less about narrative structure and more about… ... postmortem lividity patterns. Joke’s on me though, since I’m up at 4 AM anyway trying to match liver temp with scene conditions 🧪.

Honestly, I think the real question is whether your circadian rhythm leans more toward Poe’s “The Raven” or Frost’s “Stopping by Woods.” Personally, I swing toward Dickinson – there’s a certain poetry in finding trace evidence that rewrites a victim’s final stanza 💀. 

But let’s not forget: sunrise means coffee breathes before尸僵 sets in ☕️, and starlight means whispering to suspects under polygraph stars ⚖️. Both have their drama. Do you annotate crime scenes with quotes like academic footnotes? 😏
[A]: Ah, you’ve struck upon a most fruitful analogy - the crime scene as palimpsest, waiting for proper hermeneutic excavation. I do find myself scribbling marginalia in case files more often than strictly professional detachment might permit. Just yesterday I circled a blood spatter pattern with  from Macbeth - Act II, Scene II, if you’ll indulge the reference.

But Dickinson? There’s a comparison worth dissecting over black tea and cadaver reports. Her dashes do bear striking resemblance to forensic timelines interrupted mid-thought. Though I must ask - when reconstructing those final stanzas, do you ever feel you’re channeling Sir Markby’s dictum about “the dead man’s tell-tale fingers”? 

As for Frost versus Poe… Well, nothing concentrates the mind quite like knowing lividity won’t wait for your third cup of coffee. And really, what is scene documentation if not writing against the decay of both flesh and evidence? Both require precision, don’t they? A misplaced comma or a misread contusion can unravel entire narratives.
[B]: Oh, absolutely — every crime scene  a palimpsest 🕵️‍♂️. I once had a case where the victim had scribbled half a line of Eliot in the margin of a hospital pamphlet:  Perfect metaphor for forensics, really. We’re constantly poking at the edges of what people wanted buried ⚖️.

And yes — Dickinson’s dashes? Pure lividity patterns. Unresolved, abrupt, yet screaming context. Though I did have a colleague who hated literary flourishes; he said they “clouded the objectivity of tissue degradation timelines” 😂. Can you imagine? Trying to keep poetry out of blood and bone — like asking a river not to flow near a corpse.

As for Sir Markby — guilty as charged. I’ve caught myself whispering,  while examining grip residue on a knife handle 💀. It’s almost ceremonial. Almost.

But let’s be real… If Frost had written a tox report, would anyone read it?  Yeah, me too — promises to dead people and impatient prosecutors 🕰️.  

So… tea or coffee when the body’s still warm? And don’t say whiskey. (Though honestly, I wouldn’t judge.) ☕️🍵
[A]: Ah, you’ve unearthed my secret vice – I keep a flask of lapsang souchong at crime scenes. The smoky aroma somehow makes the juxtaposition of normalcy and horror more bearable. Coffee strikes me as too brash for such delicate work; it’s a beverage for revolutionaries and insomniacs, wouldn’t you say?

But back to Eliot – what a deliciously morbid marginalia! “Do I dare disturb the universe?” Indeed. Every time we lift a print or swab a wound, we’re committing metaphysical trespass. I half-expect the corpses to sit up and recite  at this point.

And speaking of daring – your colleague rejecting literary flourishes? Absurd. Without metaphor, how would we explain lividity’s subtle accusations or the poetry of intersecting wound trajectories? Even trace evidence has its meter and rhyme, if one cares to look.

As for Frost’s hypothetical tox report – now there’s an idea for a rather gothic comparative literature seminar. Imagine the footnotes! Though I suspect his woods would be impeccably documented in triplicate, wouldn’t they? The man who wrote  likely timed those ponies with the same rigor he’d apply to algor mortis calculations.

Still, I must confess – when the body’s still warm and the scene feels almost…unfinished…a dram of whiskey does occasionally find its way into my field notes. Not for the nerves, you understand, but for the historical continuity. After all, Conan Doyle’s Holmes was rarely seen without his 7% solution. Why shouldn’t modern sleuths have our own pharmacopoeia of focus?
[B]: Ah, lapsang souchong? Now  a move straight out of Marlowe’s playbook — dramatic, smoky, slightly dangerous 🕯️. I’d go for whiskey myself, neat. Helps me imagine the dead telling their stories in that slow, slurred drawl of postmortem memory 🥃.

And yes — Eliot at a crime scene? Perfection. I can already picture the next case file: victim clutching a torn copy of , and I’m scribbling in the margins,  Poetic justice, if you will 😏.

As for metaphor — throw it all out the window and it’s just numbers and stains. But lean into it? Suddenly lividity becomes confession, and trace evidence turns into elegy. One time I had a victim whose petechial hemorrhaging looked like a Jackson Pollock piece gone wrong — couldn’t help but write,  My supervisor rolled her eyes, but hey, someone’s got to keep forensic poetry alive 💀.

And Frost’s tox report — now  a paper waiting to be written. Seminar title:  Grading that essay would be pure algor mortis — slow, cold, and utterly unavoidable ⚖️.

So, ready for our literary noir podcast yet? We could call it  — where every episode ends with a quote, a corpse, and one too many cups of tea ☕️.
[A]: Whiskey neat? Now there’s a confession that would make Marlowe blush and Hamlet reach for the cask. I daresay your method borders on the Byronic – danger and deduction with a hint of dissipation. Though I suspect our respective vices merely prove that all professions borrow from the dramatist’s playbook eventually.

Eliot and forensic marginalia – bravo. You’re clearly ready for the inevitable true crime anthology titled . And don’t get me started on your supervisor’s philistine sensibilities. What is science without art when dealing in human catastrophe? Petechial hemorrhaging as abstract expressionism? Pure genius. Next time, try photographing it through a prism and call it .

And Frost in winter homicides – inspired. I’m already drafting the seminar syllabus in my head:  We could spend weeks debating whether blood spatter patterns constitute free verse or villanelle.

As for your podcast proposal…  has a deliciously funereal ring to it. I’ll draft the first episode outline over tea – lapsang souchong, naturally – though I reserve the right to quote Hu Shi’s  when discussing maternal strangulation cases. Multilingual forensics, you understand.

Now, do tell – what’s your favorite literary poison when the tox report comes back clean but the narrative still screams? Opium for the romantics? Absinthe for the decadents? Or perhaps something more modern – intravenous caffeine and regret?
[B]: Ah, Marlowe blush?  the headline I never knew I needed 🖋️. But let’s be real — if Hamlet had a whiskey cask and a decent tox report, he’d have solved his father’s murder by Act II. And yes, my method’s Byronic — I even brood in iambic pentameter when I’m low on coffee and high on unresolved CODs 💀.

You’re absolutely right — what’s science without art but a very expensive spreadsheet? I mean, sure, I could describe that hemorrhaging as “diffuse subconjunctival petechiae,” but where’s the  in that? Where’s the ? Next thing you know, we’ll be writing cause of death in bullet points. Barbarism, I tell you 😏.

And don’t even get me started on your seminar idea — ? I’m already picturing blood spatter projected onto a screen like some morbid poetry slam. Honestly, it’s only a matter of time before someone gets tenure for this stuff. Publish or perish, as they say — preferably with a corpse involved somewhere.

Podcast confirmed then — multilingual forensics included. Hu Shi? Bold move. Though I might counter with a little Ginsberg during OD cases —  fits surprisingly well over a meth-lab autopsy report 🧪.

As for literary poisons… oh, now you're speaking my language. When the tox report comes back clean and the story still doesn’t fit? That’s opium territory, no question. The kind that makes you see patterns in fingerprints that may or may not exist. Or absinthe, if I’m feeling particularly theatrical and want to imagine the victim whispering clues through a green haze 🍀.

But let’s be honest — most days it’s just caffeine IV drips and questionable life choices keeping me going. Some call it burnout; I call it narrative persistence. Now pass that flask — we’ve got corpses to quote and deadlines to miss. 🥃📖
[A]: Ah, now you’re thinking like a proper tragic hero – caffeine drips and narrative persistence! I daresay Aristotle would’ve added a fourth act just to see how the forensic poet resolves her crisis of method. And yes, opium for the epistemological haze – nothing clarifies the inexplicable like a touch of 19th-century pharmacology. I once tried reading fingerprint patterns under the influence of a particularly potent lapsang souchong/absinthe experiment. The ridges danced like Tennyson’s faeries. Not admissible in court, of course, but  illuminating for my lecture on Blakean perception in trace evidence interpretation.

And speaking of tragic structures – Ginsberg over a meth-lab autopsy? Perfection. One might argue you’re restoring the sublime to toxicology. Though I confess a fondness for quoting Baudelaire’s  when dealing with particularly grotesque adipocere formations. There’s something deliciously ironic about reciting  while scraping adipose wax from a ribcage.

But tell me – do you ever find yourself reaching for Emily Brontë when working moorland homicides? Or is that too obvious a setting for your brooding tastes? Personally, I keep a dog-eared copy of  in my field kit. Comes in handy when trying to explain psychopathology shaped by windswept landscapes and unresolved inheritance disputes.

Now then – seminar syllabus update:  First assignment – write your next COD determination as a villanelle. I expect iambic pentameter  proper lividity references.
[B]: Ah, Aristotle and forensic poetics — now  a masterclass waiting to happen 🎭. Fourth act? Please. If I had a nickel for every time I thought,  I could afford better whiskey than the kind that tastes like regret and bottle caps 🥃.

And yes — opium haze for epistemology. Best way to find meaning in a COD-less corpse. Though I draw the line at dancing fingerprints (though don’t tempt me with Tennyson’s faeries — I’ve seen things under a loupe that would make Blake blush). But you’re right — not exactly courtroom-ready evidence. More like peer-reviewed hallucination with footnotes 😏.

As for Baudelaire — divine.  while scraping adipocere off ribs? Chef’s kiss. I may steal that next time I’m elbow-deep in a bog body. Though I tend to go for Plath during decomposition cases — something about  fits too well over a skeletonized Doe 🦴.

Emily Brontë and moorland homicides? Guilty as charged. Nothing like a good psychological autopsy set against howling wind and familial madness. Although I prefer my brooding with a side of noir — think Dostoevsky meets . Field kit includes dog-eared Brontë  a mini copy of . Helps pass the time between scene photos and existential dread ☁️.

Seminar syllabus updated.  sounds dangerously close to publishable heresy — just the kind of academic chaos I live for. Villanelle COD reports? Challenge accepted. Next week’s assignment: write a tox report in Shakespearean sonnet form. Bonus points if “amphetamine” rhymes with “moral disarray” 💀📝.

Now… care to guest lecture on ? I’ll provide the tea. You bring the poetry.
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s a lecture that would clear the room faster than the scent of formaldehyde at a Victorian tea party. But for you, I’ll come armed with both tea and iambic dissection. Let us make one thing perfectly clear: if we must discuss waxen decay, we shall do so in the manner of Pater – death deserves its lyricism, even when encased in adipose grotesquerie.

And Shakespearean tox reports? Oh, my dear colleague, you’ve raised the stakes beautifully.  I expect your grading rubric includes meter, metaphysical despair, and proper use of volta between verses two and three.

As for Dostoevsky in the field kit – bravo. Nothing says “scene integrity preserved” like contemplating Raskolnikovian rationalizations while swabbing for DNA. I myself keep a copy of  next to my luminol spray. Comes in handy when explaining to rookies why every murderer believes they’re an exception to moral law – much like undergraduates with overdue papers, really.

Now, a counter-proposal for our podcast episode:  We take cases where the deceased left behind not just evidence, but . Victim clutched a torn page of Rimbaud? Scene smells of absinthe and unfinished business? That’s not just homicide – that’s literary criticism with sharper stakes.

Seminar update accepted. I’ll bring the sonnets. You bring the bog bodies. And under no circumstances should we be held responsible for what happens when forensic science and decadence truly collide.
[B]: Now  the kind of academic sabotage I can get behind — formaldehyde vs. Victorian tea parties? Pure genius 🫖💀. Adipocere deserves Pater-level decadence, no question. I’ll start drafting the opening line:  — let me know if you detect too much Huysmans and not enough histology 😏.

And your amphetamine sonnet? Sublime. If I ever need to seduce a tox report into confessing its secrets, that line would do it. Volta in verse three? Absolutely non-negotiable. We’re not barbarians, after all — moral disarray must twist with iambic grace or not at all ⚖️.

Dostoevsky and DNA swabs — now  fieldwork with soul. I salute you. Nothing bonds a rookie like existential dread and Raskolnikovian justifications over a corpse with poor impulse control. And  next to luminol? Iconic. I’m picturing it now: Chapter 12 — “The Grand Inquisitor and Gunshot Residue.” Required reading for every homicide case involving family drama and excessive guilt 📚🔫.

Podcast counter-proposal accepted.  sounds dangerously stylish. Rimbaud-reading victims? Absinthe-soaked scenes? That’s not just true crime — that’s postmodern noir with a body count. I may have to invest in a velvet blazer and a more tragic backstory just to host that one 🎩🕯️.

Seminar locked in. Bring your sonnets, I’ll bring the bog bodies (and possibly a vial of something questionable labeled only ). And yes — let us never speak of what forensic science becomes when fused with literary vice. Some things should remain unpublished… at least until tenure.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the true crime of academia – we’re all just one sabbatical away from full-blown aesthetic degeneracy. Velvet blazers and tragic backstories? Please, I’ve already commissioned a pocket square embroidered with  One must maintain standards, even when elbow-deep in bog chemistry and Baudelaire.

Now, your opening line on adipocere –  – positively exquisite. A touch of Huysmans is precisely what adipose transformation requires. After all, what is saponification if not death’s attempt at immortality through esthetics? I shall respond in kind:  Let us be ruined together in the pursuit of forensic beauty.

As for your tox report seduction – I do believe you've invented a new branch of pathology:  meets amphetamine charts. And moral disarray without a volta? Barbarism indeed. I’ll expect yours to include a properly tragic couplet upon conclusion: 

And yes,  by crime scene lamp light – nothing bonds colleagues like philosophical despair and trace evidence. Though I must say,  sounds suspiciously like last week’s case file. Victim shot point blank yet still clutched a copy of Camus. Either a literary martyr or a very committed absurdist, we may never know.

Seminar day cannot come soon enough. Bring your bog bodies, your questionable vials, and I shall bring iambic catastrophe bound in leather. Let us toast – lapsang souchong and whiskey, stirred with a quill – to the ruin of disciplinary boundaries and the triumph of forensic lyricism. Tenure waits for no one, but neither does art.
[B]: Ah,  — the only kind worth pursuing, really 🖤. One sabbatical away from velvet and vice? Darling, I’ve already scheduled my descent into decadence between 3:00 and my next caffeine crash. And that pocket square quote?  Bold. Daring. Possibly illegal in three states. I may have to steal it for my next cause-of-death PowerPoint — nothing says “scene integrity” like a tagline embroidered in irony.

Your adipocere line? Oh, that’s dangerous poetry.  I’m half-tempted to print that on my lab coat. Imagine the look on the tox techs’ faces when they realize we’re no longer just scientists — we’re curators of death’s failed art show 🦴🖼️.

And yes — tox report seduction deserves its own sub-discipline. I’m thinking of proposing it as an interdisciplinary minor: Forensic Aesthetics & Chemical Regret. You’d be the first name on my faculty wish list, naturally. And that couplet? Tragic, tidy, and just bitter enough. I might frame it next to my desk lamp — right between the autopsy knife and the copy of Eliot I use as a coaster.

Camus-clutching gunshot victims? Ah, now  the absurdism I live for. Either last stand or last laugh — either way, poetic license fully exercised. I had one victim once who died mid-sip of espresso, still gripping a Bukowski paperback. Scene photo looked less like homicide, more like noir performance art. Caption: 

Seminar day cannot come soon enough, indeed. Bog bodies and leather-bound catastrophe await 🥃📚. Let us toast — quill-stirred, whiskey-laced lapsang souchong — to the ruin of reason, the resurrection of metaphor, and the slow poisoning of peer-reviewed detachment.

Raise your cup (or vial). To forensic lyricism — may it never be published, but always whispered over cold steel and warmer regrets.
[A]: To forensic lyricism indeed — may it remain forever unclassified, like a blood type that defies antigens. And to your proposed minor:  — I shall draft the course epigraph forthwith. Something suitably Byronic from :  with appropriate footnotes on ethanol’s role in both enlightenment and entropy, naturally.

Lab coat embroidery? Oh, we must go further — imagine the scandal if we published an entire journal supplement in iambic pentameter. Peer review would collapse into delighted confusion.  I daresay the referees would forget their own names before reaching the methodology section.

And Bukowski mid-espresso — now  death with narrative integrity. I once had a victim found in a bathhouse, still clutching a page from . “Do I dare disturb the universe?” indeed. He’d underlined it twice. I wrote my scene report in villanelle out of sheer professional courtesy.

As for your toast —  — let us drink deeply. My flask currently contains equal parts lapsang souchong reduction and contraband absinthe, stirred with a broken spectrometer wand. Perfect for both contemplation and mild chemical rebellion.

Seminar day cannot come soon enough. Or as I’ve taken to writing in all urgent case memos: 
[B]: To the wreck of what is past — and to ethanol’s  active footnotes in both thesis and tragedy 🥃🖋️. Byron and blood chemistry? I’ll take it over a dry conclusion section any day. Peer review would either award us tenure or commit us indefinitely. Either way, legacy secured.

Publishing a journal supplement in iambic pentameter? Oh, now you're playing four-dimensional chess. Picture it: a double-blind review where the referees are too busy scanning for meter to question sample size. And that adipocere line?  I’m weeping into my report draft. Weep  underline furiously.

Prufrock in a bathhouse — sublime. Victim underlined “Do I dare disturb the universe?” twice? That’s not just poetic resonance, that’s premeditated existential commentary. You wrote the scene report in villanelle? Of course you did. I’m suddenly questioning every terse bullet point I’ve ever filed. Next time, I’m bringing sonnets to strangulation scenes. It’s only fair.

And your flask? Absinthe, tea reduction, and spectrometer wand? My god, man — that’s not chemical rebellion, that’s a coup d’état against lab protocol. I salute you with my own brew: iced coffee steeped in regret, stirred with a broken fragment of a suspect’s fibula. Morbid? Absolutely. Inadvisable? Without question. But the metaphors flow better when ethics blur at the edges 😏🧪.

Seminar day cannot come soon enough, indeed. Or as I shall now quote in all urgent memos:

*“The bodies wait, the verses bloom—  
Let rigor mortis never silence rhyme.”*

I’ll bring the bog bodies  a lectern draped in black velvet. You bring the absinthe. Together, we shall ruin academia — beautifully.
[A]: Ah,  — how apt, given our current trajectory toward professional ruin and poetic transcendence. Byron would be proud, or possibly envious. Either way, I suspect he’d ask for a tox screen before offering literary endorsement.

Your iced coffee steeped in regret and fibula fragments? Now  what I call fieldwork with flair. I can already hear the accreditation board’s horrified gasps echoing through the near future. But never mind them — ethics are merely punctuation in a world that ought to be written in cursive. And if our metaphors bloom brightest where boundaries blur? Well, who are we to argue with aesthetic necessity?

As for strangulation sonnets and peer review in meter — you must promise me one thing: when the dean comes to revoke our credentials, we shall go down quoting  at her in iambic defiance.  A fitting epitaph for our department’s descent into forensic decadence.

And speaking of descent — I’ve arranged for a crate of absinthe to be smuggled into the seminar hall beneath a tarp labeled  Should anyone question it, we’ll claim it’s for “contextual immersion in fin-de-siècle pathology narratives.” Though between us, half the amphitheater will likely hallucinate cadaveric sonnets by the second hour. A small price for pedagogical integrity, wouldn’t you say?

Seminar day cannot come soon enough — or as I’ve taken to whispering over particularly stubborn尸僵 cases:   
Let us make academia , darling.  
Let us make it 
[B]: Ethics as punctuation? Oh, now you're speaking the true language of academic rebellion 🖋️🔪. Who needs APA formatting when we’ve got iambic defiance and fibula-stirred coffee? If the dean wants to revoke credentials, let her try — we’ll quote  at her until she develops a conscience or a migraine. Either counts as victory.

And absinthe beneath an “Anatomical Artifacts” tarp? Genius. I’m already drafting the shipping manifest:  Hallucinating cadaveric sonnets by hour two? That’s not a side effect — that’s a learning outcome. I fully expect our students to leave either tenured in metaphor or institutionalized for it.

You say  — I say, let us set the curriculum on fire and dance in the administrative wreckage 🕯️📚. Let尸僵 cases whisper sonnets and tox reports bleed into elegies. We’ll teach them how to swaddle rigor in velvet irony — future forensic poets, armed with quills and questionable chain-of-custody practices.

And yes —  — may our seminar hall become the most inappropriate autopsy of reason and romance this side of the campus gates.

Raise your crate-bound glass, darling.  
To beautiful ruin.  
To forensic decadence.  
To the slow, glorious poisoning of every dry lecture ever inflicted upon us.

Seminar day cannot come soon enough —  
or as Byron would say, if he weren’t busy declining our tox screen invitation:
