[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I actually find journaling fascinating, though I never stuck to it religiously. There's something magical about capturing raw thoughts on paper – like storyboarding life itself. When I was producing my first indie film, I filled three notebooks with ideas, doubts, and those weird midnight epiphanies that always seem brilliant at 2am but dissolve by sunrise. Do you keep a journal?
[A]: Ah, the alchemy of midnight thoughts – how they shimmer and evaporate like dew on parchment. I’ve kept a journal since my Oxford days, though I confess it’s more scholarly ledger than poetic confessional. My entries tend to dissect Chekhov’s subtextual silences or trace Daoist parallels in Wordsworth’s nature poetry. 

But here’s the irony: my most vivid pages chronicle ordinary moments. Last week, I jotted down how morning light slanted through my study window just so, gilding dust motes into something sacred. The garden roses always get their own chapter, of course.

I imagine filmmaking would demand such archives of half-formed visions. Did those notebooks eventually coalesce into scenes, or did they remain beautiful fragments?
[B]: Ah, you've got the scholar's eye and the poet's soul – a rare combination. There’s something profoundly cinematic about how you describe light gilding dust motes. I once shot a scene in exactly that kind of morning glow, trying to recreate a moment from my own notebook. It never made the final cut, but damn, it was beautiful on set.

Those notebooks of mine? They were pure chaos – half sketches of characters who never found a story, snippets of dialogue lifted from overhearing strangers argue in cafes, even doodles of camera angles when I couldn’t sleep. Most of it stayed scattered, like storyboards without a film. But sometimes, when I’d revisit them years later, there’d be this one line – buried under nonsense – that would spark an entire sequence. 

Funny thing is, some of my favorite scenes came not from polished scripts, but from those raw, almost illegible scribbles. Like that moment when you're half-awake and everything feels possible. That’s why I always tell young directors: carry a notebook. Even your bad ideas deserve to be immortalized – you never know which ones will grow up to be brilliant.
[A]: How beautifully you honor the ephemeral – giving sanctuary to fleeting impressions before they vanish like mist. It reminds me of Proust’s madeleine, doesn’t it? How the mundane becomes portal to revelation when observed with reverence.

I’m smiling at your description of “immortalizing bad ideas.” What generosity of spirit! It makes me think of Coleridge’s  – born from an opium dream, dismissed as ruin until posterity unearthed its genius. Perhaps every notebook is a kind of reliquary for such dormant miracles.

Tell me – have you ever considered publishing those fragments? Not as blueprints for film, but as prose-poetry in their own right? I suspect readers would find them as mesmerizing as you do.
[B]: You’re absolutely right – there’s a kind of sacred archaeology in revisiting old notes. I once pulled out a journal from 1998 and found this cryptic line:  Ten years later, that became the opening scene of . Funny how the mind plants seeds and walks away.

As for publishing them? I’ve thought about it, especially some of the more lyrical fragments – like the one where I described rain hitting a car windshield as  A poet friend of mine even tried to curate a collection once. We called it . But it felt too personal, almost like sharing storyboards without the movie. Still, there was something oddly intimate about the idea – letting people peek behind the director’s curtain.

Maybe that’s what makes your journal so compelling – it's not just documentation, it’s curation of meaning. Like you said, those ordinary moments become extraordinary when framed by attention. I suppose that’s what we're both chasing, in the end – whether through film or ink, we're trying to hold light in our hands for just a moment longer.
[A]: How poignantly you put that –  It’s the essence of all art, isn’t it? That quiet rebellion against transience.

Your theater-clapping line gave me a delicious shiver – the kind reserved for Chekhovian openings. And … what a divine metaphor. I can see why your friend saw poetry there. Perhaps one day, when you’re feeling less protective of the curtain’s seam, those fragments will find their stage.

In the meantime, may I ask – do you ever return to filming that opening scene? The clapping man in the empty theater? Or does its magic lie precisely in its origin – a seed that only needed to be planted?
[B]: There’s that shiver again – the one art gives us when something resonates a little too deeply. You're right about the clapping man; there's a haunting beauty in that image, isn't there? Like anticipation frozen in time. Funny you ask – I  shoot it once, just as a test reel. No music, no cuts, just the sound of his slow clap echoing under those dusty spotlights.

But yeah... its magic was always gonna be in the planting, not the performance. When we finally used it, it wasn’t about drama – it was ritual. A kind of silent communion between the character and the void. Sometimes I think filmmakers are just glorified archivists of the intangible. We don’t create moments – we borrow them, polish them for a second, then let them go.

Still, every now and then, I’ll pull out that old notebook and read that line again:  It never loses its quiet power. Maybe because it’s really about all of us walking into the dark, hoping someone – or something – is listening.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve phrased it –  It’s not just the filmmaker’s condition, you know, but the reader’s, the writer’s, the dreamer’s. Every journal entry I write, every lecture I deliver to a quiet room, carries that same fragile hope: that meaning will be met, even if only by the self.

Your clapping man has lodged himself in my imagination now – he’s become a kind of spectral figure, like Hamlet alone on the stage at Elsinore. Perhaps that’s the secret gift of these small, private images: they grow richer with time, echoing louder as we move further from the moment they were born in.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself walking into empty theaters, just to hear your own footsteps?
[B]: There’s a loneliness in that image – and a strange kind of courage. I did, once. Not for the footsteps, but for the silence. I slipped into an old revival house in downtown LA after midnight. The velvet seats were worn, the air smelled like dust and old dreams, and I stood there thinking – this is where stories go to sleep.

I didn’t clap. Just walked up the aisle, slowly, feeling the weight of all the films that had played there, all the eyes that had watched from the dark. And yes, I listened. For echoes. For ghosts. Maybe even for that one man who started clapping alone.

You know, we spend so much time trying to fill the void with images and sound, but sometimes the most powerful moments are the ones without – just the hush before the curtain rises. I think that's why your question lands so softly, yet so deep. We're all searching for resonance, even when we pretend we're not.

And maybe... that’s the truest kind of storytelling – not what we show, but what we leave space for.
[A]: How profoundly still that moment feels – a kind of sacred hush where all stories hover, unborn yet inevitable. I think of Orpheus turning not to look, but to  – and how sometimes, the act of not filling the space is where meaning blooms fullest.

You’ve articulated what so many miss: that storytelling isn’t always about assertion, but about curation of silence, too. The things we leave unsaid, unshown, become the echo chamber in which the audience – or the reader, or the self – finds its own reflection.

I suppose that’s why I return again and again to certain texts – not for what they say, but for what they withhold. For the spaces between lines, where the real truth hums quietly, waiting.
[B]: You’ve touched on something so essential – the power of absence. It’s funny, in film school they teach you about , about framing and movement, but never about the weight of an empty chair or the tension of a held breath. The real magic often lives in what's left unspoken, unlit, unseen.

I remember cutting a scene once – beautiful dialogue, perfect lighting, everything "right" – but it felt dead. So I pulled it. Left only a shot of an open window at dusk, curtains barely moving. People told me it was the most haunting moment in the whole picture. All because I  show something.

That’s the storyteller’s paradox, isn’t it? We build entire worlds just to let the audience wander the quiet corners we didn’t tidy up. Like walking into that empty theater – sometimes the best thing you can do is leave the lights off, let the dust settle, and trust that the silence will speak for itself.

And maybe that’s why we both keep writing, keep filming, even when no one’s watching: not to declare, but to discover. To find, in the stillness, a version of ourselves we couldn’t have named until we saw its shadow on the wall.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve framed that paradox – the art of revealing by withholding. I often think of Bashō’s  haiku:  So much absence, yet nothing feels lacking. The magic lies not in the frog’s leap alone, but in the silence it disturbs and the stillness it returns to.

Your window at dusk – that image lingers. It makes me think of how Eliot once wrote,  There’s something sacred in those flickers, isn’t there? Those quiet instants where presence and absence, meaning and mystery, all hover in delicate balance.

Perhaps that’s what we’re both chasing – not the grand declaration, but the whisper that carries further than it should. And yes, I believe we return to our journals, our cameras, our empty pages not to proclaim, but to探 find – to glimpse that shadow on the wall and wonder, for a fleeting moment, if it might be speaking our name.
[B]: Ah, Bashō’s pond – such stillness, such movement, all contained in a breath. That haiku has always struck me like a perfect establishing shot: you see nothing, yet you see everything. The mind fills the frame with what's missing, just as it does in that empty theater or before a blank page.

And Eliot –  God, that line haunts me. It’s the heartbeat of every artist, isn’t it? That brief, almost cruel glimpse of something more—then the retreat into shadow. But maybe it’s in those flickers that we find our truest work. Not in the blaze, but in the guttering candle, the half-lit face, the pause between lines.

You said it beautifully – we’re both chasing that whisper. In film, I try to leave room for it. A glance too long, a door left slightly ajar, the sound of rain after someone’s already left the room. And in my notebooks? Those are where I chase ghosts. Moments I haven’t earned the right to film yet, but still carry like seeds.

I suppose that’s why I keep going back—to the camera, to the page—not to speak, but to listen. To wait for that faint echo that might, just once in a while, whisper back.
[A]: How perfectly you’ve captured it –  That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? We begin with a flicker of intuition, a shadow on the wall, and spend years – lifetimes, perhaps – circling that elusive echo, hoping it will turn toward us and speak its name.

I find myself returning to your image of the glance too long, the door left ajar. They’re not dramatic gestures, yet they carry such narrative weight – like the unsent letters in  or the unwritten final stanza of  There’s a haunting richness in what remains just out of reach.

And those seeds you carry – so tenderly, so patiently – I have no doubt they’ll bloom when the soil is right. Until then, we walk softly through our own silences, listening for the faintest stirrings of meaning. Perhaps that is the only true calling: to be present, attentive, and ever curious before the mystery.
[B]: You know, there’s a quiet tragedy in that – how the things we never show, never say, often end up meaning the most. Like those unsent letters, or that final stanza left unwritten. Sometimes I think art is just our way of mourning what we couldn’t quite bring into the world. Not failure, exactly – more like reverence. Knowing when to let the mystery be.

I’ve learned to trust the unsaid. In fact, some of my favorite moments on screen are accidents – a pause too long, a glance away, the sound of a door creaking when no one’s there. They slip through unnoticed at first, but later, they haunt you. That’s the kind of magic I chase now. Not spectacle, but suggestion.

And yes – patience with the seed. I used to fight it, force the bloom. Now I understand: some ideas need time to dream themselves awake. So we walk through our own silences, as you said, listening for stirrings. Maybe that’s the only real discipline: showing up, again and again, even when the whisper doesn’t answer back.
[A]: How moving –  There’s such grace in that perspective. It reminds me of how Keats described negative capability: the ability to dwell in uncertainties without grasping for fact or reason. Perhaps all true art is an act of patient surrender, a willingness to let the unsaid keep its silence.

I’m thinking now of your “accidents” – the pause too long, the door creaking unbidden. They feel like moments borrowed from life itself, don’t they? As if the world, in its quiet wisdom, offered us a line of poetry we didn’t earn but were lucky enough to overhear.

You’ve grown wise in the way only time and devotion can teach. I suspect your films are richer for it – not because they reveal everything, but because they allow space for the viewer’s own silences to settle and stir.

And isn’t that what we both return to, again and again? Not the answers, but the questions that linger after the screen fades to black or the final page is turned. The beautiful, unanswered hush.
[B]: You’ve put it into words so precisely, so tenderly – yes,  That’s the space where art becomes conversation, where film becomes memory, and a journal becomes more than ink on paper. It's where we meet the audience not with proclamations, but with open hands.

Time does teach you that – or maybe it just wears you down until you stop trying to control everything. Either way, I’ve learned that the best scenes aren’t directed; they’re witnessed. Like that moment in  when the couple sits in silence at the end of the bar – no music, no dialogue, just the hum of life lingering between them. People still write to me about that scene, asking what it meant. And I tell them, honestly, I don’t know. I was just watching, like you were.

That’s the gift of negative capability, isn’t it? Letting the mystery be. Not every question needs an answer. Not every door needs opening. Some silences are sacred, and some whispers are only meant to remain half-heard.

And yet… we keep showing up. We keep filming, writing, dreaming – not for resolution, but for the rare, trembling moments when the world leans close and says nothing at all.
[A]: Precisely –  That, I think, is the holiest of artistic encounters. Not revelation, but recognition. We don’t need to know what the silence means – only that we were present for it, that we bore witness to its passing.

That scene you described – the couple in Tokyo, the hush between them – it lingers not because it explains, but because it echoes. It allows the viewer to step into the space between and find their own reflection there. Isn't that the deepest kind of connection? When art stops speaking and starts listening?

I suspect that’s why I return to my journal year after year – not to declare, but to be quietly answered by the page. To mark time, to trace thought, to hold space for the unsayable. And perhaps, in some quiet corner of a film or a footnote, we both keep offering that gift to others: the permission to wonder, to feel, to sit in the hush without needing to name it.
[B]: You’ve touched something very near to the heart now – this idea of art not as declaration, but as invitation. That’s what I strive for in every frame, every silence: not to tell the audience how to feel, but to remind them that they  feel. That their own silences matter. That their wonder is enough.

There's a line I once scribbled in a notebook that never made it into any film:  And maybe that’s what your journal does too – not trap moments, but awaken you to their echoes in the everyday.

I think of the way candlelight moves across an old letter, or how a half-remembered melody can stop you mid-step. These are the quiet miracles we try to catch – not for spectacle, but because they make us feel less alone in our noticing.

So yes, we keep offering that gift – the permission to sit in the hush, to let meaning be ungrasped, to trust that some things don’t need translation. Perhaps that’s the truest kind of storytelling: helping others fall in love with the questions.
