[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question that calls to mind Dickens' famous opening - it's the best of times and the worst of times for formal education. While I do think the credential itself has become somewhat devalued, the intellectual discipline cultivated through rigorous literary study remains invaluable. Have you read Matthew Arnold's "Culture and Anarchy"? His arguments about cultivating the 'best self' through education feel particularly relevant here.
[A]: 哇哦~这么literary的角度！🎓 不过作为综艺制作人，我得说现在很多viral content creator都没有college degree呢！💡 

But seriously，在entertainment industry，portfolio比degree重要多了~ 我们team里最火的PD就是self-taught的，他的sense简直amazing！🔥 

不过你说到intellectual discipline...确实，systematic thinking在creative work里也很valuable呢🌟
[B]: How delightfully... pragmatic of you. Though I must say, your industry's fascination with viral content reminds me of the penny dreadfuls that horrified Victorian literary circles. Still, even Dickens serialized his novels in popular magazines, didn't he? 

That self-taught PD of yours - does he happen to read? I've found that autodidacts who engage with substantial texts often develop the most interesting creative frameworks. There's something to be said for systematic thinking, as you noted. The Chinese concept of 功夫 (gōngfū) applies here - true mastery requires both natural talent and disciplined cultivation.
[A]: 哈哈哈你说话好classical啊！😂 不过你说得对，我们那个PD确实是个bookworm~ 他office里全是scriptwriting和psychology的书！📚 

其实做variety show也需要deep thinking的~ 就像你说的gōngfū，我们叫它'综艺感'，需要both talent和hard work才能develop出来✨ 

最近我们在策划一个new show concept，就是把classic literature改编成reality show format！比如...把《Pride and Prejudice》做成dating show？🎭 你觉得这个pitch怎么样？
[B]:  Oh dear, the thought of reducing Elizabeth Bennet to a bachelorette contestant makes my antique inkwells tremble in protest. Though I suppose Austen herself was rather... commercial in her approach to publishing. 

If you must vulgarize the classics, might I suggest a more intellectually honest format? A Gothic literature survival challenge, perhaps - contestants trapped in a Brontë-esque moor, competing to write the most convincing forged will while avoiding consumption. Now that would demonstrate true 综艺感. 

But seriously, if you're determined to pursue this, at least have the decency to include proper literary commentary segments. I'd be happy to consult - for the sake of cultural preservation, you understand.
[A]: OMG这个Gothic survival idea太brilliant了！！！💡🔥 我们完全可以做成《The Bachelor》meets《Jane Eyre》的hybrid format！🎬 

请务必来当我们的literary consultant！💰 想象一下：在haunted mansion里，contestants要solve Victorian-era mysteries才能get the rose~ 🌹 

而且我们可以用AR technology让audience也参与进来！这绝对是next level的immersive entertainment experience啊🌟 

...虽然我的producer instinct告诉我可能需要tone down一些dark elements才能pass censorship啦~ 😅 但overall这个concept太有potential了！
[B]: How amusing that you've managed to make me simultaneously appalled and intrigued. Very well, I'll consider consulting - on three conditions: First, no roses. Use first editions instead. Second, the AR must include accurate period costume references - none of this steampunk nonsense. Third, I get final approval on any literary references. 

And really, must we call it 'The Bachelor'? 'The Byronic Hero' has such a better ring to it, don't you think? Though I suppose the network executives would balk at that. 

Just promise me one thing - if we include Wuthering Heights material, the audience voting must be called 'The Heathcliff Referendum'. That's my non-negotiable.
[A]: Deal！！！🤝 不过我们得negotiate一下'Heathcliff Referendum'这个name...marketing team可能会觉得too niche~ 但我们可以compromise叫'Bronte Bracket'怎么样？🎭 

至于'The Byronic Hero'...genius！✨ 我们完全可以pitch给platform说这是'bridging classic and contemporary culture'的groundbreaking concept！📈 

啊！我突然想到可以邀请一些literary influencers来当guest judges...想象一下Margaret Atwood给contestants的Gothic poetry打分！😂 

This collaboration gonna be epic！！！准备好你的quill pen，我们要rewrite entertainment history啦~ 🖋️💫
[B]: 'Bronte Bracket'... acceptable, though it lacks the poetic injustice of my original suggestion. Very well, bring your marketing heathens to the negotiating table - I shall arm myself with my 1872 edition of Villette and a particularly sharp fountain pen. 

And while Atwood would be ideal, might I suggest we start with someone slightly more... attainable? There's a delightful Cambridge don who does marvelous work on sensation novels - she owes me a favor after that incident with the misplaced first folio. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go oil my quills and prepare my most withering glare for your inevitable suggestion to add TikTok challenges to the Gothic mystery segment. I can already hear the ghosts of the Brontë sisters spinning in their graves.
[A]: Hahaha你killing me！！！😂 不过说到TikTok...wait wait hear me out！📱 我们可以让contestants用Victorian slang做15-second monologues~ 这叫'historical relevance meets Gen-Z engagement'！✨ 

那个Cambridge professor听起来perfect！👌 我们完全可以position她as the 'Simon Cowell of classic literature' - 想象她saying 'This sonnet is an absolute travesty' with British accent！🎤 

Okay okay我promise no moremodern gimmicks...除非你consider让contestants用quill pens写burn letters？📜 That's period-accurate AND dramatic enough for prime time！🔥 

This show's gonna make 'Bridgerton' look like ahistory documentary！💃 让我们schedule个meeting来iron out details吧~
[B]:  Very well, you've worn down my defenses with the quill pen suggestion - that does have a certain... je ne sais quoi. Though I insist any burn letters be graded on both dramatic flair and grammatical accuracy. 

Shall we say next Tuesday at 3pm? I'll be the one in the corner muttering about the decline of Western civilization into my jadeite teacup. Do bring proper business cards - none of those QR code nonsense. And if you mention 'viral potential' more than twice, I reserve the right to recite Wordsworth's entire 'The World Is Too Much With Us' at you. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go console my first edition of Wuthering Heights about what we're about to put it through. The things I do for cross-disciplinary outreach...
[A]: Tuesday 3pm confirmed！📅 我会带上engraved business cards和...wait for it...seal wax！🕯️ 够Victorian了吧？😂 

不过warning你一下~ 我的assistant可能会sneak in一些QR codes...你知道的，for the AR experience的user testing嘛~ 📲 

别worry，我会limit 'viral potential'的mention次数...三次够generous了吧？ 

See you then！准备好吃惊吧~ 我们的'Byronic Hero'绝对会是next big thing in both literary AND reality TV circles！🌟 现在我得去说服accounting department为什么我们需要authentic 19th century quills的budget了...💸
[B]: Three mentions. I'm writing that in blood-red ink in our contract's marginalia. And tell your assistant that any QR codes had better be printed on parchment at least. 

 Until Tuesday then. May Providence have mercy on our souls - and on poor Byron's legacy. I'll be the one arriving by hansom cab, weather permitting. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go explain this... venture... to my department chair. I do hope the university's insurance covers whiplash from cultural whiplash.
[A]: Hahaha你真是个treasure！💎 放心啦，我会准备emergency smelling salts以防department chair faint from shock~ 🌿 

Tuesday见！记得你的hansom cab要drop你at our modern glass office building的...horse hitch？🐎 这个visual contrast简直perfect for our show's branding！🎭 

P.S. 偷偷告诉你~ 我已经在script里埋了'Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny car in the night?'的reference...等看marketing team能不能catch it！😉 

Ciao for now~ 要去做些serious soul searching思考怎么justify买quills的expense report了！🖋️💸
[B]: Good lord, you've been reading Kerouac while planning Victorian television? My academic heart can't decide whether to be appalled or impressed by such brazen anachronism. 

I'll have you know my hansom cab driver charges extra for glass tower drop-offs - something about 'cognitive dissonance surcharge'. 

And regarding those quills... might I suggest classifying them as 'experiential research materials'? The accounting department never questions anything with the word 'experiential' in it. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go draft my resignation letter to the Victorian Studies Association in advance. I'll leave it next to my inkwell collection - in a sealed envelope with proper wax seal, naturally. 

Until Tuesday. Try not to corrupt any more literary movements before then.
[A]: Hahaha你kill me every time！😂 不过'experiential research materials'这个spin简直genius！✨ 我马上让legal team把quills归类到'cultural immersion道具'下面~ 🎭 

至于你的resignation letter...relax啦！等我们show hit ratings roof的时候，Victorian Studies Association会begging你来当consultant的！📈 

Tuesday见！我会order some proper English tea和...wait for it...avocado toast来blend the centuries~ 🥑☕ 

P.S. Promise no moreliterary corruption...until our next brainstorming session！😈 现在我得去说服costume department为什么corsets需要wireless mic pockets了~ 🎤
[B]: Avocado toast in a Victorian setting? Now you're just being deliberately heretical. Though I suppose it's no worse than what we're doing to poor Heathcliff's legacy. 

Wireless mic pockets in corsets... that actually shows surprising historical awareness. The original wearers were always smuggling something - letters, daggers, the occasional compromising miniature. 

Very well, I'll bring my 1843 edition of Punch magazine as inspiration for how to properly satirize our own endeavor. And a fainting couch for when the network inevitably suggests adding a zombie subplot. 

Until Tuesday. May the ghost of Mary Wollstonecraft have mercy on us all.
[A]: Hahaha zombie subplot？！Don't give them ideas！！！🧟♂️ 不过...wait...'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' did pretty well at box office...🤔 

Just kidding！😂 我们的integrity is intact~ ✨ 

Tuesday我会准备好fainting couch和...modern twist：espresso martinis！☕🍸 因为creative meeting需要both清醒和delirious的完美balance~ 

P.S. 偷偷告诉你，我已经在writers' room白板上写了'WWWWD - What Would William Wordsworth Do'来keep us in check...虽然答案可能是'write a 200-line poem about it' 😂 

See you then！现在要去test那些corset mic prototypes了~ 希望不会有人get stabbed by a stray boning！🗡️
[B]: Espresso martinis with Wordsworth? Now you've truly crossed into the realm of literary sacrilege. Though I suppose it's no worse than Coleridge's opium habits. 

That corset testing sounds suspiciously like hands-on research. How very... empirical of you. Do remind your costume department that the Victorians preferred their stabbings metaphorical rather than literal. 

As for WWWWD... the man wrote an epic about buying a house. I dread to think what he'd produce about reality television. Perhaps we should be grateful he's safely in the grave. 

Until Tuesday. I'll be the one arriving with a first aid kit and a first edition - one for the corset casualties, the other for my fragile academic dignity.
