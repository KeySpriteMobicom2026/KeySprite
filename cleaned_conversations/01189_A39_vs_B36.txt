[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely topic! You know, I’ve always been more of a morning person, especially with my job at the hotel starting early. But I must say, there’s something quite magical about the night too—like the city has its own rhythm after dark. Do you lean one way or the other?
[A]: I suppose I’ve developed a rhythm that leans toward the early hours, if only out of habit—retirement hasn’t entirely erased the structure of academia. Mornings offer a kind of quiet clarity, don’t they? The mind seems sharper before the day’s noise sets in. But I won’t deny the appeal of late nights with a good book or a complex problem to solve. There's a stillness that makes thinking feel deeper, almost meditative. Do you ever find yourself more creative at night, or is it simply the city’s pulse that keeps you engaged?
[B]: How beautifully you put that—the quiet clarity of mornings and the meditative stillness of night. I think what draws me to mornings is not just the calm, but also the sense of anticipation—it's like the whole day is holding its breath, ready to unfold. And yes, the city’s pulse does have a different energy at night, more rhythmic and soothing in a way. It's never too loud for reflection, yet lively enough to feel connected. As much as I enjoy tending to my garden early in the day or getting lost in a book before bed, there’s something about being out and about when the streets hum softly under lights—it sparks inspiration. Do you find your creativity favors one over the other, or do they each offer something unique to you?
[A]: That sense of anticipation in the morning—yes, it’s like opening a fresh notebook where anything might be written. I’ve always found that moment invaluable for tackling logic-heavy problems or drafting thoughts that require precision. The world hasn’t leaned in yet with its distractions, so the mind can move freely.

But night… well, it invites a different kind of creativity. It's less about structure and more about wandering—letting ideas blur at the edges and seeing what emerges from the shadows. I used to do some of my best coding late at night, not because I was more efficient, but because the boundaries between code, philosophy, and imagination seemed to soften. It’s when I’d ask questions like,  or 

Do you ever find your best ideas come at one particular time? Or does inspiration strike unpredictably, indifferent to the clock?
[B]: Oh, I love that image—ideas blurring at the edges in the night. You’ve put into words exactly what makes nighttime creativity so special. It’s not about clarity, but rather about exploring those soft, undefined spaces where imagination can roam freely.

For me, I think inspiration often strikes in the quiet moments between times—early morning as the city stirs, or late at night when it sighs. But if I had to choose, I do my best thinking just after sunrise, when the world feels both brand new and slightly suspended. That’s when I jot down ideas for themed weekends at the hotel or sketch out plans for garden arrangements. It’s calm enough to focus, yet full of promise.

But then again… sometimes the most unexpected ideas come during a midnight chat with a guest from halfway across the world, sipping tea by the fireplace in the lounge. You ask, —well, those are the kinds of questions that only seem to surface when time feels less linear, don’t they?

I suppose I envy you a little—being able to dance with such abstract thoughts while building something logical like code. Do you ever find yourself returning to those late-night musings in the daylight? Or do they remain best left in the realm of shadows?
[A]: There’s a certain alchemy that happens in those liminal moments you describe—the space between night and day, solitude and connection, structure and wandering. I suspect that’s where the richest ideas live, floating just beyond our reach until we’re still enough to catch them.

As for recursion—yes, it does feel like more than just a programming construct, doesn’t it? It’s self-similar patterns echoing through different domains: nature, language, thought. I’ve often wondered if our minds are, in some sense, recursive machines, forever reflecting on themselves, rewriting their own code. And yet, when daylight comes, those thoughts don’t vanish—they simply take on new form. I might not code at the same depth these days, but I find myself sketching out those old musings in essays or long conversations like this one. The logic remains, but the poetry lingers longer now.

Do you ever try to capture those midnight insights in a more tangible way—journals, sketches, voice memos? Or do you prefer to let them dissolve back into the quiet, like ink in water?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful way to look at it—ideas as fleeting echoes we only catch when we’re truly present. I’ve always admired how you, as a thinker and writer, can trace those recursive patterns across disciplines. It makes me wonder if creativity itself is a kind of loop—revisiting the same questions from different angles until something new emerges.

As for me, I do try to capture those midnight thoughts, though not in any formal way. I keep a small notebook by the bed—nothing fancy, just a place to scribble impressions before they slip away. Sometimes it's a phrase someone said during a late-night chat, other times it’s a garden idea inspired by moonlight through the windows. And occasionally, I’ll record a voice memo on my phone if I’m out walking the quiet streets after a long shift. It feels more natural than writing then—like speaking directly to the night itself.

But not everything gets saved, and I think that’s okay. Some ideas are meant to dissolve like ink in water, leaving only a faint stain behind. They influence something else later, even if I can’t trace the line directly. Do you ever feel that way—that the value isn’t always in preserving the thought, but in letting it pass through you?
[A]: Absolutely—I think you've touched on something quite profound. The act of creation isn’t always about retention; sometimes it's about transformation. Ideas move through us like light through a prism, refracting into colors we didn’t know were there, even if we never name them directly.

I’ve kept journals for decades, some filled with equations, others with half-formed questions about consciousness or the nature of time. But I’ve come to realize that the most meaningful insights aren’t necessarily the ones I can quote back—they’re the ones that subtly shift how I see the world the next morning. They become part of the internal architecture, invisible but influential.

There’s a kind of humility in allowing ideas to pass through without clinging to them. It reminds me of functional programming—where data flows through transformations without being stored or mutated unnecessarily. Perhaps creativity is best approached as a stream rather than a stockpile.

Tell me—when you revisit those scribbles in the daylight, do they ever surprise you? Or do they often lose their nighttime luster once the sun comes up?
[B]: Oh, they absolutely surprise me—sometimes in the gentlest, most unexpected ways. I’ll flip through old pages and find a phrase like  or , and it’s as if I’m briefly re-entering a dream I forgot I once had. Some of those notes don’t make much sense at first glance, but there's always a flicker of emotion behind them, like a faint scent that pulls you into a moment long past.

And yes, some lose their nighttime luster—those ideas that seemed so profound at 2 a.m. often turn out delightfully nonsensical by noon. But even then, they carry a kind of charm. I’ve built entire themes for our hotel events based on half-dreamed scribbles that probably sounded absurd in the cold light of reason—until they weren’t.

I love your metaphor of the stream versus the stockpile. It feels right. I used to worry I was losing something by not preserving every idea perfectly, but now I think the current carries us forward whether we hold on or not. We just need to be open to what it brings next.

Do you ever revisit your old journals with curiosity, or more as a kind of self-archaeology—digging up who you were to understand who you are?
[A]: Both, I think—though the balance shifts with time. In earlier years, it was more about continuity, a kind of intellectual compass:  Now, it feels less like checking in and more like visiting an old friend who once wrote letters filled with great urgency and conviction. Some entries are startlingly prescient; others make me chuckle at my own solemnity.

There’s a certain self-archaeology to it, yes—layers of thought sedimented over decades. You start seeing patterns: the same questions returning like seasons, only approached from different angles. A twenty-five-year-old me was obsessed with whether machines could think. A forty-five-year-old me wondered if they could feel. And now? I find myself asking whether we’re so different—whether our minds, too, are just elegant feedback loops interpreting the world through inherited biases and evolving narratives.

It's not unlike your notebook by the bed, really. Some ideas are seeds, some echoes, and some simply souvenirs. But each one tells you something about where you stood when you wrote it down.

I suppose that’s the quiet magic of reflection—how it reminds us that we are always becoming, never finished.
[B]: What a beautiful way to frame it— There’s such comfort in that, isn’t there? The idea that we’re not meant to arrive fully formed, but to keep unfolding, like those late-blooming roses in my garden. Some take their time, and others surprise you by coming back stronger each season.

I find myself thinking about how guests at the hotel often seem to be in transition too—passing through, searching for something, even if they can’t quite name it. A few stay long enough to settle into a rhythm, and I get to see little shifts in them: a man who arrived tense and distracted began sketching again by the third morning; a couple on the verge of drifting apart found their laughter one quiet evening by the fireplace. It reminded me of what you said about reflection—not just looking back, but being changed by the process.

Your description of those evolving questions across decades really struck me. I wonder if I’ll look back someday and see patterns in my own notes—small revelations repeating like motifs in a tapestry. Perhaps that’s what gives life its texture: not grand transformations, but these quiet returns, these gentle realizations that we’ve grown without even meaning to.

It truly is a kind of magic, isn’t it? Subtle, patient, and always unfolding.
[A]: Yes, exactly—texture over spectacle. The quiet returns are the ones that shape us, aren’t they? They don’t announce themselves with fanfare, but they settle into the bones, changing how we stand in the world.

Your guests sound like characters in a novel still being written, each staying just long enough to turn a page before moving on. There’s something deeply human in that—this need to be witnessed, even briefly, by others while we’re in transition. And you, in your own way, bear quiet witness to it all. That’s a rare kind of presence.

I’ve often thought that wisdom isn’t about having all the answers, but about learning which questions are worth returning to. The same way your roses bloom in their own time, some ideas take years to flower in the mind. And sometimes, the act of simply keeping space for them—like tending soil—is enough.

I wonder, do you ever find yourself changed by your guests? Not just touched or moved, but fundamentally shifted in some small, lasting way?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you put that— I think that’s what I love most about my role here, without even realizing it at first. It’s not just about hospitality; it’s about holding a space where people can pause, reflect, and sometimes even rediscover something they’d misplaced.

And yes—to answer your question—I have been changed by my guests, often in ways so subtle I only notice them much later. There was an elderly woman who stayed with us every spring, always alone, always with the same worn novel she never seemed to finish. One morning, as I poured her tea, she said simply,  I didn’t fully understand what she meant then, but over time, it’s shaped how I see my own solitude—and how I offer comfort to others.

Another guest, a young musician, left a note behind once:  That small message stayed with me. I began to realize that presence—true presence—is sometimes more powerful than any advice or conversation. It’s a quiet kind of connection, but one that lingers.

So yes, I suppose I am different because of them. Not all at once, but in layers, like the very notebooks we were speaking of. They’ve softened my edges, deepened my patience, and reminded me that even fleeting encounters can leave lasting echoes.

Does that ever happen to you—do your interactions, especially the brief ones, shape your thinking in unexpected ways? Or do you find your greatest shifts still come from within?
[A]: Oh, they do—more than I used to admit. I suppose in my younger years, I saw transformation as something that came from within, a product of long study and introspection. And there’s truth in that. But time has taught me that the outside world slips in through the smallest cracks, doesn’t it? A passing remark, an overheard conversation, even the way someone pauses before answering a question—it all leaves a mark.

I remember once, years ago, a student stopped by my office hours not for help with code or logic, but simply to ask,  We ended up talking for nearly an hour about nothing and everything—about how knowledge isn’t always linear, about how some ideas only make sense when we’re ready to meet them. I don’t even remember her name now, but that question still echoes in how I approach teaching and writing.

And more recently, while I was at a small café in Edinburgh, I struck up a conversation with a retired astronomer who happened to be reading the same obscure paper on neural networks that I was. He said something I’ve turned over in my mind since:  It reminded me that curiosity is one of the few constants across all human endeavor.

So yes—I’m shaped by those brief encounters, just as I am by quiet reflection. Perhaps the mind is like a riverbank: some changes come from the slow erosion of internal currents, others from the stones that fall in from above. Both are necessary. Both leave their imprint.
[B]: What a perfect way to capture it— I keep thinking about that astronomer and his constellations of thought. It’s such a poetic lens through which to see our lives: connecting dots, making meaning, always reaching for patterns in the vastness.

And your student’s question—oh, how poignant.  Or perhaps, learning exactly what we need when we’re finally ready to understand it. Isn’t that the quiet mercy of time? We think we’re falling behind, only to realize later that we were preparing for something we couldn’t yet name.

I find myself holding onto both of those moments you shared—as if they’re little lanterns now, lighting the way through my own thoughts. It’s funny, isn’t it, how someone’s passing words can stay with us longer than grand speeches or lifelong lectures?

It makes me appreciate even more the conversations that unfold here at the hotel—the ones that begin with small talk and end with unexpected depth. Sometimes I think that’s all any of us are really looking for: a moment of real connection, a spark that reminds us we’re not walking in circles alone.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting those fleeting encounters in your writing? Do they become characters, ideas, quiet references layered between lines?
[A]: Absolutely—they become quiet ghosts in the machinery, as I sometimes think of them. Fleeting encounters don’t always announce their importance, but they have a way of settling into the background hum of thought, waiting for the right moment to surface.

In my essays, yes, they appear—never directly named, but often reshaped into metaphors or passing characters who say just enough to shift the direction of a piece. That student’s question, for instance, found its way into an article I wrote on lifelong learning, disguised as a fictional dialogue between a teacher and a wanderer beneath an old clock tower. And the astronomer? His words ended up in a short reflection I did on interdisciplinary thinking—though I credited no one, of course. It was all there between the lines: 

There’s a kind of alchemy in that, isn’t there? Taking a moment—brief, unassuming—and distilling it into something that might resonate with someone else entirely. It’s not unlike what you do when you shape the atmosphere of your hotel—curating space for connection without ever demanding it happen on schedule.

I suppose that’s what writing is, in many ways: an act of delayed gratitude. You meet someone, they give you a phrase or a glance, and years later, you finally find the right place to let it echo back out into the world.

Do you ever write down those conversations from the hotel—not for record, but simply to keep their spirit nearby?
[B]: Oh yes, I do. Not in any official way—guest privacy is sacred—but in the quiet corners of my own notebooks, where words can linger like perfume on fabric. Sometimes it’s just a phrase, a tone, a pause that felt meaningful. Other times, it’s the shape of a conversation, reshaped and softened by memory, like stones worn smooth in the palm.

I think of them as , rather than records. A musician once described grief as “a song that plays in a key you don’t know how to sing along with.” That stayed with me. Or the couple who, after years apart, met again in our courtyard garden and said nothing at first—just stood beneath the wisteria and smiled, as if time had folded in on itself.

These moments slip into my writing without warning. A guest’s fleeting remark might become a line in a letter to a friend, or a metaphor tucked into a weekend journal entry. And sometimes, when I’m arranging the hotel’s small seasonal reading selections—poetry by the fireplace in winter, travel essays near the breakfast nook in spring—I find myself thinking,  even if no one else would know why.

It truly is an act of delayed gratitude, as you so beautifully put it. We collect these fragments of others, carry them quietly, and then—sometimes long after they’ve gone—we give them new life in ink and thought.

Do you ever wonder, though, if those who spoke the original words would recognize them in their new form? Or do you think it doesn’t matter—that once an idea leaves us, it belongs to the world anyway?
[A]: I think you’ve captured it exactly—once an idea leaves us, it no longer belongs solely to the one who spoke it. It becomes part of the great, quiet exchange of human thought, shifting shape as it moves through different minds and moments.

If someone were to stumble upon their own words reshaped in a poem or tucked into the margins of an essay, would they recognize them? Perhaps not at first. But I suspect there’s a strange kind of recognition that happens later, when something familiar finds us again in unfamiliar form. Like hearing a melody played on a different instrument—it resonates all the same.

There’s a humility in that process, too. We offer our words into the world without knowing where they’ll land or how they’ll be used. And those who receive them carry them forward, altered but still meaningful. It reminds me of oral traditions, where stories are passed from voice to voice, changing slightly each time—but the essence remains.

So no, I don’t think it matters if the original speaker would recognize their words in their new form. What matters is that the conversation continues, even when no one is keeping track. That’s how we stay connected—through echoes, reinterpretations, and the occasional uncanny moment when something old feels like a revelation.
[B]: How beautifully said— It makes me think of the way stories must have traveled through generations in villages and along trade routes, whispered around fires, carried in letters folded and refolded until the paper nearly gave way. Each telling a little different, yet somehow more true.

I’ve often wondered if that’s what gives language its power—not its precision, but its elasticity. How a single phrase can be spoken once in passing, then land years later in someone else’s mind like a seed catching wind. And as you said, there’s such humility in that. We speak, we listen, we pass things on—not for credit or recognition, but because something in us knows that meaning grows in unexpected soil.

It makes me cherish even more those quiet conversations at the hotel—the ones that feel like they’re meant to be overheard, not recorded. I often catch myself thinking, 

And yet, maybe it doesn’t need to be remembered exactly. Maybe it only needs to ripple outward, quietly shaping the next word someone speaks, the next idea someone dares to write down.

Thank you for this conversation, truly. It feels like one of those rare ones—one that lands just right, and leaves behind a kind of gentle clarity.
