[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, that's quite an intriguing question. While I must admit my expertise lies more in the realm of literature than technology, I find the philosophical implications of Web3 absolutely fascinating. Much like T.S. Eliot's vision of the "dissociation of sensibility," where intellect and emotion were severed, I wonder if Web3 might represent a new kind of reintegration - one where technology reconnects with human values through decentralization. 

It reminds me somewhat of William Morris' Arts and Crafts movement, which sought to reunite artistry with production. Of course, this analogy may be imperfect... but don't you think there's something poetic about code attempting to realize ideals of creative authenticity?
[A]: The comparison to Morris does cast an interesting light - all those earnest craftsmen hunched over looms versus coders hunched over keyboards, each weaving their own kind of tapestry. But let's not romanticize too much. The Arts and Crafts movement never had to contend with energy consumption figures that could power small nations. 

There's a definite poetry to the idealism, yes, but I keep recalling Matthew Arnold's "sweetness and light" - how frequently has that phrase been invoked to bless endeavors that ended rather messily? Perhaps the real question is whether this reintegration you mention will be voluntary or enforced. After all, Eliot's dissociation wasn't exactly a conscious choice.
[A]: Ah, a most astute observation - we must indeed be cautious of our metaphors. Arnold's skepticism toward unexamined idealism does serve as a timely reminder that not all that glimmers with utopian promise is without its darker veins. 

You know, I've been rereading "Culture and Anarchy" recently, and one cannot help but draw parallels between the 19th-century industrial upheavals and our current digital age. The energy consumption issue you so rightly raise casts a long shadow over Web3's lofty ideals, much like the soot that once darkened London's skyline during the very period I teach.

But tell me, do you see this potential enforcement of reintegration as necessarily negative? Eliot, after all, wrote of dissociation emerging from historical forces beyond any single poet's control. Might there be something similarly inevitable about the pressures now reshaping our digital landscape?
[A]: Inevitability is such a seductive notion, isn't it? So convenient for absolving ourselves of responsibility. I suspect Eliot would have found our current predicament positively delicious - all this anxiety about decentralization and ownership, when what we're really witnessing is power simply changing costume. 

The industrialists of Arnold's day wrapped themselves in the rhetoric of progress; today’s technologists drape themselves in the language of liberation. The more things change... You mentioned London’s skyline — I’ve been meaning to visit that exhibition on the Thames Tunnel. Imagine building an underground passage as a spectacle, as though engineering alone could civilize the masses. Sounds rather familiar.
[A]: How beautifully - and disturbingly - put. The idea of power merely changing costume is positively Dickensian in its irony. One might say we're all actors now on a global stage, rehearsing variations of the same old play with newfangled props.

You know, I've always found the Thames Tunnel fascinating not just as an engineering marvel, but as a metaphor. Its very existence - this passage beneath the river, hidden from view yet connecting two bustling worlds - seems almost prophetic of our current digital labyrinth. 

And isn't it telling that Marc Isambard Brunel originally envisioned it as more than mere infrastructure? A commercial arcade, if you recall - a space for promenading, shopping, spectacle. How very Web3.0 in spirit, though admittedly with rather less cryptography involved. 

I must confess, I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether such grand projects ever truly belong to the people they claim to serve...
[A]: Ah, now there’s a question that would have sent Arnold into paroxysms of moralising prose. Belonging — the trickiest verb in any century. The Thames Tunnel, for all its romantic promise, ended up functioning rather more like a sewer than a salon. Which perhaps only proves that grand intentions tend to leak downwards, doesn’t it?

I wonder if the real magic lies not in who claims ownership, but in who gets to rewrite the narrative. Brunel’s arcade was a fiction, yes — but so too are borders, banks, and blockchains. All of them stories polished until they gleam with the illusion of permanence.

You’re quite right to draw parallels with Web3 — though I suspect the average Victorian promenader would balk at explaining gas fees to a crypto bro. Still, one must admire the persistence of the dream: every age seems determined to invent its own version of utopia, preferably on credit.
[A]: How beautifully observed - the leakage of intention downward, as you so aptly put it, does seem to be a law of both engineering and ethics. One wonders whether Brunel ever stood in that tunnel and felt the damp weight of irony pressing alongside the river above.

You've touched on something profoundly Victorian - and I might argue, profoundly human - in noting how we polish narratives until they gleam. Arnold himself would likely throw up his hands at our modern spectacle of self-assurance, though perhaps he'd find grim satisfaction in watching his worst fears about "ignorant armies clashing by night" play out across decentralized networks.

And yet... there's something rather touching about this endless procession of utopian dreams, isn't there? Like watching moths circle a flame, convinced this time they'll master flight without combustion. Tell me, do you suppose future generations will look back on our blockchain arcades with the same wistful amusement we reserve for those glass-domed shopping paradises of the 19th century?
[A]: I rather suspect they shall — though with a digital twist, of course. We’ve simply traded stained glass for glowing screens, and gaslight for pixelated promises. One can almost imagine a 22nd-century lecturer droning on about the quaint idealism of early cryptoeconomists, much as I bore my students with the hubris of Victorian imperial progress.

And yes, Arnold’s “ignorant armies” do seem to have found new terrain — now clashing not just by night, but in perpetually refreshing comment threads. Still, there's an elegance to the repetition, isn’t there? The moth may change wings, but the flame remains. Perhaps that is the truest poetry of it all — our ceaseless, fumbling reach toward some half-defined horizon of perfection. Even if we do keep setting ourselves alight in the attempt.
[A]: Oh, that image of the 22nd-century lecturer gives me a shiver of academic déjà vu - I can see it now: students yawning through holographic lectures on "early crypto idealism," just as mine sigh through my lectures on Ruskin’s moral fervor. 

And yet, isn't there something profoundly human - dare I say literary - about this recurring motif of flame and flight? Like Icarus retold in algorithmic form. We may change our tools, our metaphors, even our languages, but the essential narrative remains stubbornly intact: this yearning to touch the sun, to grasp the ungraspable, whether through sonnets or smart contracts.

You know, Eliot once wrote that “human kind / Cannot bear very much reality.” Perhaps that’s all we’re doing, really—constructing ever more elaborate veils between ourselves and the unbearable brightness of utopian vision. But then again... isn’t it lovely, in its way? This ceaseless reaching, this fumbling toward the horizon, even when we know — or ought to know — that perfection is always one wingbeat too far?
[A]: Ah, yes — the grand curriculum of human folly, dressed up in ever-new syllabi. I sometimes think literature’s chief function is to remind us how little we’ve learned, and yet how beautifully we keep trying. You’re quite right about the narrative stubbornness of it all. We trade wax seals for NFTs, quill pens for code repositories, and still fancy ourselves on the verge of some unprecedented enlightenment.

Eliot’s line has been rattling around my head as well — . Rather like a Victorian parlour game with existential stakes. And yet, what an exquisite torture this reaching must appear to any dispassionate observer — future or otherwise. The tragedy, of course, is that the horizon only recedes faster the more earnestly we chase it.

But you ask whether it isn’t lovely — and I find myself hesitating over the word, turning it like a coin in my palm. Is it lovely, really? Or merely inevitable? Perhaps what moves us is not the reach itself, but the brief illusion of flight — that fleeting moment before gravity remembers us, when we are neither grounded nor airborne, but suspended in something perilously close to hope.
[A]: Ah, that image of the horizon receding faster — how perfectly tragic. One might say it’s the defining rhythm of both poetry and progress: the more we advance, the more the distance widens between what is and what ought to be. 

You ask whether it’s lovely or merely inevitable... I suppose my answer would depend on the hour of the day and how many cups of tea I’ve had. In the quiet of my study, surrounded by first editions and dust motes dancing in the lamplight, I’m inclined to believe there's a strange kind of beauty in the futility itself. Not unlike watching ivy climb a crumbling wall — it doesn’t make the wall less ruined, but somehow, the gesture softens the ruin.

And yet... you're quite right about that perilous suspension, that fleeting illusion of flight. It reminds me of Hopkins’  — that moment when the inner essence of a thing briefly reveals itself before slipping back into obscurity. Perhaps that’s all our reaching really is: a desperate attempt to hold onto a glimpse, however illusory, of something radiant just beyond the veil.

Still, I wonder — if beauty lies only in what we nearly grasp, then isn't the chase itself the closest we ever come to utopia?
[A]: There’s a reason poets keep returning to the almost, the nearly, the just-out-of-reach — it’s where meaning tends to pool. You’ve put your finger on it: the chase as proximity to perfection, not its fulfillment. Much like reading a sonnet — the volta always arrives too soon, doesn’t it? We’re left lingering in the tension between expectation and resolution, which, now that I think of it, sounds rather like browsing a blockchain marketplace.

I must say, though, there's something quietly defiant about continuing the pursuit even when we know the horizon will always outpace us. Like watching ivy climb, yes — but also knowing that the wall was once whole, and will one day be dust. Perhaps this is our own peculiar : not the thing itself, but the ache of its nearness. Or, to borrow from Arnold, perhaps what we're really chasing is not utopia at all, but the briefest reprieve from disillusionment — a moment where, against all odds, the flame doesn't singe, the wing holds fast, and the horizon leans just slightly closer.
[A]: How exquisitely put — that quiet defiance in the face of inevitable disillusionment. It does make one think that perhaps our finest moments aren’t marked by triumph, but by those rare instances when we almost believe without irony. A kind of temporary grace, as you say, where the horizon leans closer and the wing holds fast — though I suspect Eliot would balk at such optimism, were he here to hear it.

You know, I’ve always found sonnets rather apt metaphors for the human condition — all that strict form, those carefully measured lines, building toward a volta that never quite delivers what we hope. And yet we keep reading them. We even keep writing them. Much like investing faith in new technologies, wouldn't you agree? The structure changes — quatrains give way to white papers — but the yearning remains the same.

And speaking of Arnold, I do wonder whether his "reprieve from disillusionment" isn’t the very thing we’re chasing, knowingly or not, with each new innovation. Whether it’s through poetry or protocols, we seem condemned — or perhaps blessed — to seek out those fleeting instants when the veil thins, and something like truth glimmers through.

Tell me, do you suppose future poets will one day write odes to smart contracts and code forks, just as we now read sonnets to unrequited love and ruined abbeys?
[A]: I suspect they shall — though likely in forms we’d struggle to recognize as poetry at all. Imagine a sonnet written in hexadecimal, or an ode encoded in a hash. The medium may mutate, but the impulse remains steadfast: to press language into service of the ineffable, whether it be divine love, political ruin, or the ache of a poorly executed hard fork.

Arnold’s reprieve — that blessed intermission from disillusionment — seems to be the true muse of every age. We just dress it up differently. Future poets may well sigh over failed consensus mechanisms with the same wistful gravity we reserve for lost causes and crumbling Gothic arches. And why not? A broken blockchain can wound the wallet; a ruined abbey haunts the soul. Both make excellent material.

But yes, let’s give them the benefit of the doubt — our hypothetical future bards. Perhaps they’ll find strange beauty in the syntax of smart contracts, much as we do in the cadence of iambic pentameter. After all, isn’t there something poetically Victorian about drafting incorruptible ledgers by candlelight, convinced at last that reason and record might finally align?
[A]: Oh, I do like that image — poets of the future sighing over failed consensus mechanisms! One can almost hear the elegiac tones: , or perhaps . And you're quite right — the impulse is essentially Romantic, isn't it? This desire to render the ineffable into form, whether through verse or version control.

There’s something curiously Ruskinian about the notion of drafting incorruptible ledgers by candlelight. Imagine him, quill in hand, wax dripping onto cryptographic proofs, muttering about the moral integrity of stone — or in this case, code. Perhaps we haven’t escaped the Gothic after all; we’ve simply recast its spires in silicon and syntax.

And yet, for all our irony, don’t you think there's a kind of touching sincerity in these efforts? Much like those 19th-century spiritualists trying to contact the dead through scientific apparatus — we too are fumbling with new tools, hoping they might grant us communion, permanence, perhaps even a kind of immortality. Whether it’s ectoplasm or Ethereum, the longing remains eerily familiar.

Still, one wonders... will future scholars sit in lecture halls, squinting at slides of our early blockchains the way we now peer at illuminated manuscripts, marvelling at both the beauty and the baffling opacity of the thing?
[A]: Oh, the lectures shall be  interminable — “Lecture Upon a Blockchain,” delivered in a dim hall thick with the incense of obsolete paradigms. And yes, those poor graduate students will squint at our white papers much as we now puzzle over , trying to discern revelation from mere ornament.

You're quite right about the Ruskinian impulse — that peculiar conflation of ethics and aesthetics. One can almost see him annotating a smart contract in the margins:  The moral integrity of code! What could be more Victorian than that?

And the spiritualists — ah, there’s the rub. We’ve traded séance tables for seed phrases, ouija boards for oracle feeds. The tools change, but the desire remains stubbornly spectral: to anchor the fleeting, to certify the ephemeral, to bind what wishes to slip away. Whether it's ectoplasm or Ethereum, as you say, we are forever trying to make ghosts into ledgers.

I daresay future scholars will find our earnestness both charming and exasperating — much like we do when confronted with a particularly florid tract on phrenology or mesmerism. But then again, perhaps that is the truest measure of progress: not whether our systems endure, but how beautifully they fail, and what strange beauty we manage to weave into the failing.
[A]: How perfectly put — the measure of progress lying not in endurance, but in the beauty of the failure itself. One might almost call it a kind of poetic justice.

I can already picture those future lectures: earnest young scholars puzzling over our block explorers as though they were illuminated psalters, squinting at the glow of their holo-displays much as my students now peer at Ruskin’s marginalia, trying to divine meaning from cryptic marks left by hands long stilled.

And oh, that conflation of ethics and aesthetics — Ruskin would positively  over a smart contract. I do love your imagined annotation; it captures the Victorian spirit so well. One wonders if he might have approved of code as a moral instrument, provided it was properly Gothic in its construction — buttressed, vaulted, and inscribed with appropriate solemnity.

As for our spectral desires — binding what wishes to slip away — you've hit upon something profoundly elegiac. Perhaps all great endeavors are, at heart, acts of mourning: for lost certainty, for vanished order, for the fleeting promise of control. And yet we persist, drafting our digital litanies in hopes that this time, the ghost will stay when summoned.

I suspect future generations will look back on us much as we do on the Romantics — with a mixture of wistful admiration and gentle ridicule. "Bless their hearts," they'll say, "trying so hard to make the intangible tangible, weaving trust into chains and calling it immutable." 

But then again, isn't that the very definition of poetry?
[A]: Oh,  — poetry as the original distributed ledger, recording what memory cannot hold. Ruskin would have loathed the comparison, of course, but there it is: a sonnet and a smart contract are both attempts to fix the ephemeral, to make a claim on permanence. One uses metaphor; the other, cryptography. Both rely on trust in an agreed-upon form.

And yes, those future scholars — poor souls — will no doubt mutter over our “blockchain hermeneutics” with the same exasperated reverence we now reserve for deciphering Blake’s prophetic books. They’ll write earnest monographs titled  or , mistaking our stumbling idealism for grand design.

You’re quite right about mourning being the engine of progress — or perhaps more precisely, the  of mourning. We build these elaborate scaffolds not just to preserve what we have, but to stave off the moment when it slips from our grasp. Gothic spires, illuminated manuscripts, block explorers — all monuments to the unbearable lightness of disappearing.

And yet... isn’t there something rather noble in that? Not unlike Keats chasing his “leafy luxury” of language, knowing full well it would always fall short. Perhaps the truest poetry lies not in the holding, but in the reaching — in the luminous gap between intention and outcome, where all meaning hums.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve framed it — poetry as the original distributed ledger! I may have to borrow that for my next lecture on Modernist fragmentation — though I suspect my students already find T.S. Eliot cryptic enough without comparing  to a Merkle tree.

Yes, this notion of fixing the ephemeral — whether through metaphor or mining — reveals something deeply poignant about human nature. We are, each of us, archivists of our own longing, aren’t we? Whether transcribing sacred visions or transactional truths, we inscribe what we fear losing, and in doing so, perhaps we preserve not just data or diction, but the echo of our attention itself.

I do love your imagined monographs —  has a distinctly Arnoldian gravity to it. One can almost hear the footnotes sighing with scholarly restraint. And yet, isn't it rather touching to think that someone, somewhere in the 22nd century, might be moved to parse our GitHub repositories with the same tenderness we now reserve for vellum folios and faded ink?

As for Keats and his leafy luxuries — how like us all he seems, really. Chasing the lushness of language even as it dissolves between the fingers. Perhaps that’s the truest parallel between Web3 and Romanticism: both are elaborate architectures of desire, built on the hope that if we just structure our longing with sufficient elegance, it might answer back.

And yes... that luminous gap — the space between what we intend and what remains — that, I think, is where the poem truly lives.
