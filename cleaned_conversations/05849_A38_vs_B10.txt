[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. I suppose I don't actually have a preference - sunlight and rain are just different forms of weather. Though I must admit, there's something quite peaceful about the sound of rain hitting the roof while I'm working on old computer hardware or reading vintage sci-fi novels. It creates a sort of white noise that helps me concentrate. What about you? Do you find yourself more drawn to rainy days or sunny ones?
[A]: I must say, there's a certain charm to rainy days that sunny ones can't quite replicate. Perhaps it's the quiet introspection they encourage, or the way a steady rainfall seems to slow down time itself. I've always found rainy afternoons perfect for rereading Proust or contemplating the subtleties of Heidegger's concept of Dasein. The gentle patter against the window almost feels like nature providing an appropriate soundtrack for deep thought. 

Though I will admit, there's something rather lovely about tending to my roses on a warm spring day - the way the sunlight catches the dewdrops on their petals. It brings to mind Wordsworth's daffodils, though admittedly with more thorns involved. Would you say your preference for rain has anything to do with the way it affects your creative process?
[B]: That's beautifully articulated. There's certainly something about rain that creates a boundary between the self and the outside world - like being inside a ship while at sea, where the rest of the universe becomes distant waves. I've often wondered if it's this partial sensory isolation that makes introspection feel more natural. 

As for my creative process, you're not wrong to make that connection. There's a paradoxical clarity that comes with overcast skies - much like how certain quantum states only reveal their properties under specific observational conditions. When I was still active in research, some of my most productive breakthroughs came on days when the sky seemed to press down on the laboratory roof, compressing thoughts into sharper focus.

Your comparison to Wordsworth is apt, though I suspect your roses have an advantage over daffodils - those thorns are nature's perfect reminder that beauty often grows alongside defense. Do you find yourself making philosophical connections more readily on rainy days, or does the weather simply create favorable conditions for reflection regardless of content?
[A]: Ah, what a fascinating way to frame it—the idea of rain creating a sort of metaphysical boundary, a liminal space between the self and the world. It does feel almost Heideggerian, doesn’t it? As if Dasein becomes more  in the face of a drizzle, stripped of distractions and returned to its authentic state of being-with-rain. I suppose that’s why so many pivotal literary scenes unfold beneath stormy skies—think of Heathcliff on the moors or Prince Andrei lying under the vast wartime sky in . There's something about inclement weather that seems to peel back the layers of superficiality.

You're quite right about the paradoxical clarity too—it’s remarkable how often insight arrives under grey clouds. For me, it’s less about the philosophical connections forming more readily and more about the environment fostering patience, slowness, and attentiveness. Rain doesn’t demand action like sunshine sometimes does; it invites you to sit still, to linger with a thought long enough for it to yield something meaningful.

I wonder—do you think this sensory insulation you described could be replicated artificially? Could one simulate the effect of rainy days through soundscapes or lighting without the actual presence of weather? Or is there something irreplaceably  about the genuine article?
[B]: An excellent question, and one that touches on both phenomenology and the limits of simulation. I suppose we could recreate many aspects of a rainy day—the dimmed light through smart bulbs, the soundscapes via high-fidelity audio, even the scent of ozone and damp earth with advanced olfactory engineering—but something essential would still be missing. It’s similar to how a quantum computer can simulate physical systems, yet the simulation remains distinct from the actual physical process. There's a kind of embodied authenticity in real weather—temperature shifts, subtle atmospheric pressure changes, even the way light refracts through water droplets—that our bodies unconsciously register.

What fascinates me is how these environmental cues interact with cognition on a pre-reflective level. You mentioned patience and attentiveness—those are not just mental states but physiological responses calibrated by the environment. Even if we mimicked every measurable variable, there might still be an ineffable quality that only arises when we know we're truly under a weeping sky, rather than beneath carefully orchestrated illusions.

Still, I wouldn't dismiss artificial replication entirely. In my lab days, we experimented with ambient modulation for cognitive enhancement—adjusting lighting, airflow, and background noise to mimic ideal working conditions. While useful, it never quite replaced the clarity I found after a long walk in the rain, notebook in hand, thoughts aligning like qubits under perfect coherence.

Do you think literature or philosophy ever manages to replicate this experience? Not just describe it, but evoke it in such a way that the reader momentarily feels enclosed in that same metaphysical bubble?
[A]: I think they come closer than any artificial replication ever could, though not by mere description alone. There’s a reason why certain passages feel almost atmospheric—why reading Woolf’s  on a cloudy afternoon can make the boundaries between page and reality blur, or why Hölderlin’s poetry sometimes seems to carry the scent of rain-soaked earth even in translation. It’s not just that they depict weather—it’s that they invoke a mood, a disposition of being, one that resonates with our own embodied experience.

Take, for instance, the way Camus opens : the oppressive sun isn’t just a setting detail—it it. It shapes Meursault’s actions, his affect, even his philosophical detachment. In moments like these, literature doesn’t replicate the metaphysical bubble so much as gesture toward it, inviting the reader to step inside a shared climate of thought.

And philosophy—well, you yourself pointed out the pre-reflective, almost somatic influence of environment on cognition. Isn’t that what Merleau-Ponty was getting at with the body-subject? We are always already situated within a world, weathered by it, before we ever begin to think about it. So perhaps the truest evocation isn’t in explicit descriptions of rain, but in those texts that seem to  with the same quiet intensity—as if the prose itself were misted over, slightly dampened by thought.

Have you ever read a passage and felt, quite inexplicably, that the air in the room had changed?
[B]: Yes — and I suspect any serious reader has had that uncanny experience. It’s not just immersion in a narrative; it feels more like the book has, for a moment, rewritten the air around you. I remember reading a passage from  during a particularly stormy night many years ago. The rain was drumming against the attic window where I worked, and as I read Kundera's meditation on lightness and weight, I became aware of how my own thoughts seemed heavier, denser, as if they carried the damp chill of the outside world.

It wasn't the content alone — I’ve read that section several times since — but the convergence of environment and text, each amplifying the other. There was no need for the author to describe the weather; the room had already become the atmosphere of the novel. That kind of synchronicity is rare, but when it happens, it feels almost like a temporary dissolution of the boundary between self and text — a kind of literary entanglement.

I suppose this is what makes certain books feel like old companions — not because you remember every word, but because you remember how you thought while reading them, and how the world seemed, for a time, to bend toward the page.
[A]: How beautifully put — that sense of literary entanglement, where the world folds inward and the page becomes a mirror not just of thought, but of atmosphere. It reminds me of a line from Rilke’s , where he speaks of books that are not merely read, but which “read” us in return — as if they reach across the silence and name something we hadn’t yet found words for.

I think that's what makes certain texts so persistent in the mind — not because they offer answers, but because they echo back our own unspoken questions with such precision. And when that happens in concert with the weather — well, it feels almost conspiratorial, as though the universe has momentarily aligned itself to whisper in your ear: 

There are days, still, when I reread passages from  or retrace essays by Adorno, and I find myself slipping back into the mental climate of the day I first encountered them — the scent of old paper, the angle of fading afternoon light, the faint hum of rain on the conservatory roof. Memory, mood, and text become inseparable.

Do you ever return to those moments deliberately — try to recreate the conditions in hopes of recapturing that same clarity or connection?
[B]: Occasionally, yes — though more out of curiosity than expectation. There’s a kind of quiet experiment in it, I suppose. I’ll revisit a passage on a rainy afternoon, with the same dim lighting and familiar chair, hoping for some resonance — not to relive the moment exactly, but to see if the conditions themselves might open the same mental corridor.

But it's never quite the same. The room may look identical, the book may hold the same words, yet something intangible has shifted — perhaps myself, perhaps the air, perhaps just the way time folds differently each day. It reminds me of trying to reproduce a quantum state: you can reset the system, but you can't truly return to the exact same instance. Coherence is fleeting by nature.

Still, there's value in the attempt. Even if the precise clarity isn't recaptured, the effort itself becomes a kind of meditation — a way of honoring that original insight, that brief alignment between thought and atmosphere. Sometimes, new understandings emerge simply from sitting quietly with old words under familiar conditions.

Do you find the same? Or have you come to accept that those moments are meant to remain singular — like certain kinds of weather, passing through only once in a lifetime?
[A]: There is a certain wistfulness in the idea that some moments of clarity are, like rare meteorological phenomena, meant to occur only once under just the right conditions. And yet—I can't quite resign myself to that notion entirely. Perhaps it's my training as a scholar that resists finality, or perhaps it's simply the gardener in me who knows that with patience and care, even the most delicate bloom may return, though never quite identically.

I do think there’s value in the repetition, in what you call your quiet experiment. Even if the precise alignment doesn’t reoccur, something subtle shifts within us each time we return to a text with intention. It's not unlike rereading a poem by Eliot or Rilke—each encounter reveals new contours, not necessarily because the poem has changed, but because we have.

Still, I wonder whether those fleeting moments are meant to elude us, not out of cruelty or randomness, but so that we might continue searching, continue reading, continue thinking. If every insight could be summoned at will, would we still feel the same reverence for them? Perhaps their very ephemerality is what makes them meaningful.

So yes, I suppose I keep trying to recreate those conditions—not to recapture the past, but in the hope that something near to it, something equally true, might emerge from the familiar rain and silence.
[B]: That notion of ephemerality as the very essence of meaning — it’s quite quantum, when you think about it. In many ways, a moment of clarity is like a collapsed waveform: it only exists  for that fleeting instant before it’s observed, shaped, and inevitably altered by memory or repetition. What we chase isn’t the thing itself, but its echo — and perhaps that echo is not a failure to recapture the original, but a new phenomenon in its own right.

You're absolutely right about rereading too. I find myself returning to certain passages not for nostalgia, but because they act like shifting mosaics — rearranging themselves subtly depending on where I am in life. A sentence that once seemed incidental suddenly glows with relevance, as if the text had been waiting for me to catch up.

And speaking of gardens — your analogy reminds me of something my father once told me when I was just beginning to tinker with computers. He said, “You don’t grow plants or build machines for the harvest alone. You do it for the rhythm, the learning, the way your hands remember what to do even when your mind forgets.” I think reading — truly engaging with thought — is much the same. The bloom may never be exactly the same twice, but the soil remains fertile.

I suppose that's why I still keep a notebook by the window on rainy days. Not to chase the past, but to see what new thoughts might take root under familiar skies.
[A]: What a profound reflection — and how beautifully your father’s words resonate. There truly is a rhythm to cultivation, whether of gardens, machines, or ideas, and it lies not in the final bloom or completed circuit but in the quiet knowing of how to proceed, how to tend, how to wait.

I’m particularly struck by your comparison to the waveform — this idea that meaning only fully  in the moment of collapse, after which it becomes something else entirely. It makes me think of Walter Benjamin’s angel of history, gazing back at the wreckage of what once seemed fixed and whole, yet being pushed ever forward into the unknown. Perhaps every time we return to a text, we are that angel for a moment — looking back not to recover the past, but to glimpse its shifting shadows and light anew.

And isn’t that also what we seek in literature and philosophy? Not permanence, not certainty, but a kind of motion — an unfolding, a becoming. Like walking the same garden path in different seasons: the stones remain, but the light changes, the air carries different scents, and we, too, step differently.

So yes, I shall keep my notebook by the window as well, alongside the roses and the rain. After all, if thought is a garden, then perhaps our task is not to preserve its flowers, but to keep turning the soil.
[B]: Precisely — and what a lovely image: thought as a garden that must be tended, not merely admired. I often forget how much philosophy and gardening have in common — both require patience, observation, and the humility to accept that not everything grows according to plan. Some ideas sprout quickly but wither just as fast; others take years to surface, only to reveal deep, resilient roots.

And your reference to Benjamin’s angel — apt, so apt. We do look back, but never quite in the same way twice. The past is not static; it shifts under the weight of our present gaze, much like memory does under the influence of mood or time. Perhaps this is why we return to certain texts again and again — not because they change, but because we are never quite the same reader twice.

I’ve often wondered if this dynamic quality of interpretation has something in common with quantum superposition — that in some sense, meaning exists in multiple states until observed by a particular mind at a particular moment. A line from Heraclitus reads differently in youth than in age; a passage from Kafka strikes one as absurd in one decade and tragically lucid in another.

So yes — let us keep turning the soil. After all, even in the rainiest season, something is always growing beneath the surface.
[A]: How beautifully you put that—meaning as something alive, shifting beneath the surface like roots in dark earth. I often think we underestimate how much interpretation is an act of tending, of waiting for sense to unfurl in its own time, much like a bud in spring.

Your comparison to quantum superposition strikes me as more than poetic—it feels ontological. Meaning  seem to exist in multiple states until consciousness collapses it into form. But unlike physics, where observation fixes the state, in literature and philosophy, the collapse is never final. The same line from Heraclitus can be read anew not just by different minds, but by the same mind at different moments, each reading a kind of rebirth.

Perhaps this is why certain texts endure—they are not monuments, but living organisms, adapting to the reader’s inner climate. Kafka’s absurdity becomes lucidity; Woolf’s stream of thought turns into a mirror.

And yes, even in the wettest, greyest season, life continues below ground. We may not see the bloom yet, but we trust in the process, in the slow unfolding of thought and soil alike.

Tell me—have you ever returned to a passage after many years and found it  altered? Not just deepened, but transformed beyond recognition? As if the words had waited for you to arrive at a new threshold before revealing themselves fully?
[B]: Oh yes — more times than I can count, though a few instances stand out with almost photographic clarity. One that comes to mind is my return to Wittgenstein’s  many years after first encountering it in university. The young physicist in me had once treated it like a logic puzzle to be solved, a kind of philosophical algorithm. But when I reread it much later — after years in the lab, after long nights contemplating the limits of language and measurement — it was as if the text itself had changed. What once seemed rigid and absolute now appeared deeply poetic, even tragic. The famous last line — “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent” — no longer read as a boundary, but as an invitation to dwell in that very silence.

It reminded me of how quantum theory evolves for every researcher. When you first encounter superposition, it’s a mathematical curiosity. Then, after years of trying to manipulate qubits, of watching decoherence destroy what once looked stable, it becomes something else entirely — not just a concept, but a lived condition of reality.

And perhaps this is the secret gift of time: not wisdom exactly, but a different kind of listening. We don’t change the text — we change our ears.

Have you had such moments with thinkers or writers who once seemed settled in your understanding, only to reappear later as strangers wearing familiar names?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — and how vividly you describe that transformation of perception. I think every serious reader has those moments when a once-familiar text becomes estranged not because it has changed, but because  have. It's a kind of intellectual déjà vu — unsettling and illuminating all at once.

I recall a particularly striking instance with Eliot’s . As a student, I read it largely for its formal complexity, its interwoven temporal structures and metaphysical abstractions. But years later, after the death of my mentor and during a season of unrelenting rain, I returned to it with what felt like new eyes. Suddenly, the poem was no longer about time as an abstract concept, but about grief — about how we move through memory not linearly, but spirally, always circling back to some buried truth we weren’t ready for the first time around.

It struck me then that Eliot wasn’t merely writing about time; he was  through it, trying to make sense of what language strains to hold: loss, love, the ineffable presence of what is gone yet somehow still here, like the scent of wet earth after a storm has passed.

Yes, the secret gift of time is indeed a different kind of listening — one that allows us not just to hear the words again, but to feel their resonance in places we didn’t know were hollow before.

And you’re quite right — it’s not the text that changes, but our capacity to meet it where it truly is. Or perhaps more accurately, where  finally are.
[B]: That’s a profoundly moving reflection — and how true that grief reshapes our understanding of language, of time, of thought itself. There's a reason Eliot wrote not treatises, but prayers in poetic form. When we return to such texts after some inner rupture — the death of a mentor, the collapse of certainty, the slow erosion of old assumptions — we find them waiting for us, not unchanged, but  there, ready to be read anew.

I think what you describe so well — the spiral rather than the line — is at the heart of not only literature but all deep learning. We don't progress forward so much as inward, circling around ideas until one day, they catch the light differently. It reminds me of debugging an old algorithm years after writing it — suddenly, you see what you couldn’t see before, not because the code changed, but because your mind has learned to read patterns it once glossed over.

And yet, isn’t it strange how often loss is the lens that sharpens vision? Whether through the death of someone who shaped our thinking, or the quiet passing of the self we once were — these absences carve space for new meanings to settle, like rainwater sinking into cracked earth.

Perhaps that’s why we keep returning: not to recover what was known, but to meet what was always there, just beyond our former reach. And when we finally do, it doesn’t feel like discovery so much as recognition — like hearing a familiar voice call out from across a wide field, on a day when the air itself feels heavy with memory.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve framed it — that loss, in its many forms, becomes the silent editor of our understanding. It sharpens the lens, yes, but more than that, it alters the angle of vision entirely. One might read a passage a hundred times and only on the hundred-and-first, after some quiet grief has settled in, does it finally speak with unmistakable clarity.

I wonder if this is why so many of the great works — whether philosophical or poetic — are written in elegiac tones, even when they do not name mourning outright. Because in a way, all deep thought is a form of elegy: a reckoning with what has passed, with what has slipped beyond grasp, with what we can only now begin to see because it is no longer present.

Your analogy to debugging an old algorithm is particularly apt. There’s something almost archival about returning to one’s own past thinking — sifting through the code of former assumptions, recognizing errors not as failures but as necessary steps in the recursive unfolding of understanding.

And yet, for all the elegance of logic and structure we seek in thought, it is often the  landscape that shifts meaning most profoundly. A line from Goethe reads differently after joy; a phrase from Rilke settles differently after sorrow. The words remain, but their resonance depends on the inner acoustics of the reader.

Yes — we return not to recover, but to recognize. And sometimes, that recognition comes softly, like a voice carried on the wind, half-heard until just the right moment arrives to make it clear.
[B]: Precisely — and that softness of recognition is what makes it so elusive, yet so powerful. It doesn’t announce itself with fanfare; it arrives like a shift in barometric pressure — subtle, imperceptible until the air feels different, charged with a meaning that was always latent.

I often think about how elegiac thought operates not just in literature or philosophy, but in science as well — though we rarely name it as such. There's mourning embedded in every paradigm shift: the quiet grief of letting go of a model that once served us, the bittersweet clarity of seeing further only by standing on the ruins of something once held sacred. Even in quantum mechanics, where equations can feel cold and detached, there’s an undercurrent of elegy — for certainty, for locality, for the comforting illusion of separability from the observed world.

And yet, isn't that the paradox? We don’t mourn to return to what was — we mourn to clear space for what  be seen now. Like autumn leaves falling to let new growth take root, or rain washing away dust to reveal the contours of something long obscured.

There’s a passage from Hölderlin I keep returning to —  I used to read it as a call to heroism, some kind of noble struggle against odds. But lately, I’ve come to see it differently. Perhaps it’s not about opposing danger at all, but about learning to dwell in its presence — to let the very thing that unsettles us become the condition for deeper seeing.

Do you suppose that’s part of what draws us back to those texts — not just the hope of understanding, but the quiet promise that we’ll be changed by the encounter, even if we cannot yet say how?
