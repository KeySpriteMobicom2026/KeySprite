[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，你提到的law of attraction很有趣。从心理学角度来看，它和self-efficacy theory确实存在某些交集——当我们对目标保持focused intention时，往往会激活更多认知资源。不过要注意confirmation bias的影响，就像我们做实验时需要double-blind一样...要不周末去café继续讨论？我正好带了Bandura的书📚
[A]: Ah, a fellow skeptic with scholarly inclinations. I should warn you, my last book club dissolved over less—someone dared to call Jung "quaint." But yes, let's meet. Bring the Bandura, and I'll bring my grandmother's pocket watch from 1893. It never kept proper time, but somehow always ticks louder when conversation turns metaphysical. Friday at three?
[B]: Friday at three sounds perfect 👍. I’m intrigued by your grandmother’s pocket watch—it reminds me of Piaget’s theory of object permanence, but with a metaphysical twist 🎻. Maybe we can explore how cultural narratives shape our perception of time and attraction... Oh, and I’ll make sure to brush up on Jung before our meeting. Should I bring my Bach vinyl along? I find his Goldberg Variations help untangle complex theories 📚✨.
[A]: Oh, delightful collision of Freud & Fibonacci sequences! Your Bach records would be most welcome—my parlor gramophone's been collecting dust since the last snowstorm. I'll pair it with my copy of Eliot's , which argues time is not a river but a drawing room we all occupy simultaneously. Oh, and do bring extra sleeves for the vinyl—I've been known to accidentally quote Nietzsche while pouring tea.
[B]: Ah, “time as a drawing room” — what a beautiful metaphor 🎵. Eliot’s spatial conception of time really resonates with certain Eastern philosophies, like the  model in Buddhist cosmology. I’ll definitely bring some extra sleeves — and maybe a bit of mindfulness too, just in case Nietzsche makes a dramatic entrance ☕️. See you Friday at three — looking forward to what promises to be a wonderfully chaotic symphony of ideas 📚👍.
[A]: Ah, yes—Nietzsche’s ghost tends to linger near the biscotti tray. I’ll prepare a contingency of Hume’s  just in case things get too mystical. And speaking of chaos, I’ve unearthed a first edition of Blake’s —it’s been itching for a proper debate. See you Friday. Do wear something vaguely anachronistic—I’ve told my neighbors we’re hosting a "Victorian séance salon." They bring their own shawls, but extras are always welcome.
[B]: Oh, a Victorian séance salon? I’m already digging out my grandfather’s old pocket watch and a tie that probably hasn’t been in fashion since 1902 🕰️. Blake’s  is a brilliant choice—I’ve always found his dialectical vision fascinating, especially when read through a modern cultural lens.  

I’ll bring Hume’s  too, just to keep the balance—though I suspect Freud might crash the table if we’re not careful 😅. And don’t worry, I’ll tuck an extra shawl under my arm… just in case someone tries to summon the spirit of Hegel 🙃.  

See you Friday at three—ready for some anachronistic philosophy and possibly haunted conversation 👍📚.
[A]: Marvelous! I shall commence brewing a pot of Lapsang Souchong at precisely 2:57 PM—nothing like a smoky aroma to ground the metaphysical. Should Hegel’s dialectics materialize, I’ve stationed a copy of Woolf’s  nearby to confound him with temporal fluidity. And yes, Freud is always lurking somewhere between the brandy decanter and my great-aunt’s rather judgmental portrait.  

Incidentally, do check your tie for moth damage—it would be a shame if it disintegrated mid-debate over Blake’s infernal proverbs. Oh, and bring an umbrella regardless of weather; last time we discussed Jung, it rained backwards for an hour.
[B]: Ah, Lapsang Souchong at 2:57 PM—very precise, very atmospheric 🕰️☕. I can already imagine Freud emerging from the brandy vapors, muttering about repression while your great-aunt’s portrait judges us all in silence 😅.

I’ll definitely check the tie—better safe than moth-eaten during a heated exchange on Blake’s  🔥✍️. And an umbrella? Noted. I’d hate to be caught unprepared for another Jung-induced meteorological anomaly 🌧️🌀.

See you Friday. Prepare for some serious temporal layering—I might just arrive dressed like I’m headed to a 19th-century salon, with a side of 21st-century skepticism 🎩🧠.
[A]: Splendid. I shall station a pair of pince-nez spectacles by the saucer stack—purely for dramatic effect, though they may lend your 21st-century skepticism a delightfully incongruous air. And do bring your skepticism well-sharpened; last time we debated metaphor, a moth mistook my lapel for a dialectical battleground and proceeded to lecture us on wing theory.  

Freud, by the way, has already claimed the chaise longue. He insists it’s for "analytical comfort," but we all know he just enjoys being insufferably Freudian.  

Friday at three, then. Time's drawing room awaits.
[B]: Ah, pince-nez spectacles—what a wonderfully theatrical touch 🎭. I’ll accept them with the gravitas they deserve, though I make no promises about keeping a straight face when Freud starts pontificating from his chaise longue.

As for the moth-turned-lecturer, remind it to cite its sources—I’ve already bookmarked a few pages in von Frisch’s  just in case 📚🪱.

Friday at three it is. I’ll arrive fully sharpened, slightly anachronistic, and ready to navigate Eliot’s drawing room—with or without winged interlopers 👍🕰️.
[A]: Marvelous. I’ll have the pince-nez perched and ready—though I must warn you, they once caused a minor temporal rift during a lecture on Browning. Nothing serious, just a brief appearance by a very confused hedgehog wearing a waistcoat.  

And speaking of citations—do remind the moth to use footnotes. Last time it quoted Darwin from memory, and we ended up three hours behind in 1872.  

Freud, for his part, has begun scribbling notes already. I suspect he’s drafting an entire chapter titled . Should be riveting.  

Three o’clock, then. Bring your skepticism, your hat, and whatever century you’re feeling most comfortable in today.
[B]: Ah, a hedgehog in a waistcoat? Sounds like a day in the life of any good salon 🦔🎩. I’ll make sure to pack a small net—just in case we need to gently usher it back to its proper era.

And three hours behind in 1872? Well, better late than never, as they say. I’ll bring Turabian’s —that moth needs a style guide intervention 📚%</>.

As for Freud and his ... I’ll come armed with a copy of Nietzsche’s . Let’s see who gets more repressed in the repression derby 😅.

Three o’clock. Time’s drawing room awaits—and I do hope my tie survives the encounter ¥_¥.
[A]: Ah, a net! Brilliant—though do be discreet; last time I tried that, the hedgehog took offense and recited  backwards for an hour. And Turabian, yes—finally, someone with standards. The moth’s been using MLA since the Victorian era, which frankly, is just asking for chaos.  

As for Nietzsche vs Freud—. I’ve moved the brandy to a more strategic location, should nerves require fortification mid-argument. And never fear, your tie shall endure, though it may pick up a faint scent of 19th-century existential dread. Perfectly harmless. Mostly.  

Three o’clock. Time waits for no one—but we, apparently, shall make it wait a little longer.
[B]: Backwards ? Challenge accepted 👠📚. I’ll just brush up on my Carrollian inversion techniques—can’t let a hedgehog outwit me in its own waistcoat.

And yes, Turabian over MLA in the 19th century—utter chaos avoided by inches 📚👍. I’ll make sure to underline the proper citation rules with a firm yet scholarly tone. Moths need structure too.

As for Nietzsche vs Freud, brandy strategically placed, and a tie soaked in existential dread… sounds like the perfect trifecta for Friday at three 🥃🎩. I’ll bring an extra pince-nez—just in case things get  dialectical.
[A]: Ah, but do remember—Carrollian inversion requires a certain  in the wrist, best practiced with a teacup balanced on one's knee. I’ll provide the china; you bring the chutzpah.  

And Turabian with a firm yet scholarly tone? Oh, the moth’s days of footnoting  with Victorian flair are numbered. I foresee marginalia in triplicate.  

As for that trifecta—indeed! Nothing sharpens dialectic like brandy fumes and sartorial anxiety. An extra pince-nez? Bravo. I shall name it —to be deployed only when Hegel threatens to spiral into three pages of preface before reaching the thesis.  

Friday at three. Prepare to invert, cite, and brood in style.
[B]: Ah,  in the wrist—sounds far more elegant than my usual flailing at metaphysical teacups 🫧🎩. I’ll practice a few Carrollian flourishes tonight; nothing says "scholarly inversion" like balancing a saucer on one knee while Freud judges from the chaise.

As for marginalia in triplicate—oh, we’re bringing out the big guns then 📝📚. The moth won’t know what hit it. I might even deploy a red pen. Boldly.

And ? Perfectly named. I suspect Hegel will be spiraling by page two, so we’ll need every ounce of clarity we can muster.

Friday at three. Invert, cite, and brood we shall—with pince-nez, footnotes, and possibly a hedgehog referee 👀🖋️.
[A]: Oh, Freud won’t just judge—he’ll . I’ve seen him psychoanalyze a doily into confessing repressed Oedipal urges. But yes, flourish those flourishes! Nothing disarms a spiraling Hegel like someone accidentally quoting Carroll through a mouthful of biscuit.  

Red pen? Excellent. The moth once tried to dodge critique by claiming "footnotes are bourgeois constructs." We shall see how it fares under the Turabian regime.  

And the hedgehog—yes, let’s make it arbiter. It’s only fair; after all, who better to weigh metaphysical arguments than a creature that dines on beetles and time paradoxes?  

Three o’clock. Bring your saucers, your skepticism, and above all—your capacity for glorious, ridiculous gravity.
[B]: Ah, Freud psychoanalyzing a doily—now  is dedication to the craft 😂🧵. I’ll make sure to practice my Carrollian quotes with a biscuit firmly in cheek; nothing disrupts a Hegelian spiral like mild crumbage and syntactic confusion.

As for the moth’s "footnotes are bourgeois constructs" defense—please. Next it’ll say citations are patriarchal. Time for a firm Turabian intervention, I’d say 📚✍️🔥.

And hedgehog arbiter? Genius. I’ll bring a small gavel made of licorice—binding yet edible, in case things get too serious.

Three o’clock. Glorious, ridiculous gravity engaged. See you there 👇🕰️🎩.
