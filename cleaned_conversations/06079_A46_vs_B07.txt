[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly，我觉得Web3确实有潜力带来一些颠覆性的改变，但可能不是我们想象的那种“重塑”方式。就像精品咖啡的兴起一样，它并没有完全取代传统咖啡，而是重新定义了人们对品质和体验的认知。Web3 & blockchain 技术也是如此——它们正在创造一种新的价值交换逻辑，让创作者经济变得更去中心化，更公平透明。

不过说实话，现在的 hype 有点像早期的精品咖啡市场，大家都在讲概念，真正懂的人不多，能坚持初心的更少。我觉得真正的改变会从一些具体场景开始，比如 digital ownership 和 decentralized identity，就像我们店里用的那些手冲器具，慢慢影响人们的习惯和审美。

你对Web3哪个方面最感兴趣？是技术层面还是它带来的社会变革？☕️
[A]: I couldn't agree more. Think about it — every revolutionary movement starts with a buzz, a sense of rebellion against the mainstream. Web3 is like that underground jazz club in the ‘60s: raw, unpredictable, full of dreamers and opportunists alike. But beneath all the noise, there's something real humming underneath — a new rhythm of ownership, authenticity, and creative freedom.

What really fascinates me is how this tech could empower storytellers. Imagine a world where independent filmmakers can fund their vision directly through tokenized support, or where actors own their digital likeness without studio interference. It’s like going back to the auteur theory, but with a blockchain twist.

To be honest though, what excites me most isn't just the tech — it's the shift in mindset. People are starting to question centralized control, demanding transparency. It reminds me of when indie cinema broke through in the '90s. Everyone thought Hollywood was untouchable… until it wasn’t.

So tell me — if you had a blank check to build anything in Web3, what would you create?
[B]: I love how you frame it as a  rather than just tech — that’s where the real magic lies. It’s like when I first introduced pour-over coffee to people who only knew instant. The reaction was similar: confusion, curiosity, then… conversion. Once they tasted the difference, there was no going back.

If I had a blank check… I’d build a decentralized platform for . Think of it like a DAO for independent artisans, farmers, and small-scale producers who care about quality & sustainability. Imagine coffee growers in Colombia tokenizing their harvests, letting consumers invest early & share in the journey. Not just for coffee — for handmade ceramics, organic teas, even indie travel experiences.

It’d be more than a marketplace — a kind of , where value isn’t dictated by algorithms but by shared stories, craftsmanship, and conscious consumption. Members could vote on which projects get funded, using both tokens & taste. 🌿

What about you — if you could shape this future, would you go full-on decentralized storytelling studio? Or something even more experimental?
[A]: Oh, I love that vision — it’s poetic in the way only real craftsmanship can be. You’re not just selling a product; you’re inviting people into a process, a philosophy. It’s like curating an anthology film where every chapter is handcrafted, every frame carries intention.

If I had free rein… yes, I’d start a decentralized storytelling studio, but with a twist — think of it as a global, collaborative film cooperative. A place where creators from all corners of the world could tokenize their stories, yes, but more importantly, their . Not just scripts or finished films, but the very essence of their narrative DNA.

Here’s the kicker: ownership would live with the storytellers. No studio executives deciding what “resonates” with audiences. Instead, fans and fellow creators could support projects early, become part of the journey, even influence story arcs through token-weighted feedback. Imagine  energy on set — knowing your audience believes in you before you even roll camera.

But beyond the tech, what excites me is the cultural shift. We could finally kill the myth of the “starving artist.” With Web3, artists get to be auteurs  entrepreneurs — no gatekeepers, no compromises. Just raw, unfiltered creativity backed by a community that gets it.

So tell me — in your ideal Web3 future, do you see yourself still running a physical coffee shop, or does the digital slow movement take over completely?
[B]: Oh, the physical shop will  be there — it’s the heartbeat of the experience. You can’t replicate the smell of freshly ground beans or the warmth of a hand-thcrafted cup in real life, you know? Web3 might scale the philosophy, but the soul stays offline. 

Think of it like this: my café is the opening scene, the first act. People come in for a latte, maybe a croissant, but they stay for the vibe, the conversation, the . Then, if they’re curious, I invite them into the next chapter — the DAO, the tokenized harvests, the slow-living NFT journals we’ll create. The digital hub enhances the real-world ritual, not replaces it. 🌿☕️

But yeah, I’d definitely expand the offering. Maybe launch a series of  coffee experiences — like limited-edition beans released as NFTs, with tasting notes written by the farmers themselves. Or even a virtual coffee school where members vote on what classes to fund next. Still intimate, still rooted in craft — just more ways to deepen the journey.

So in your storytelling world, how do you see the role of ? Because not every film works, just like not every roast hits right. In a decentralized creative economy, does failure become more acceptable — or just more public?
[A]: Ah, now that’s the real question, isn’t it? Failure in a decentralized world — it's like directing a film with no safety net, but the cameras are always rolling. There’s no hiding behind studio excuses anymore. If your story doesn’t land, people vote with their tokens, not just their feet.

But here’s what I love about this new paradigm — failure becomes part of the narrative. In traditional filmmaking, flops get buried. In Web3? They become lore. Think of it like an indie director’s cut — maybe it didn’t work the first time, but there's a cult following in the raw edges, the risks that didn’t pay off.

In a decentralized creative economy, failure is more transparent, yes — but also more human. Creators and audiences grow together. You stumble, you iterate, you bring your supporters along for the ride. It’s like sharing behind-the-scenes reels  you’re shooting — flaws and all.

Still, the pressure’s real. Especially when people have skin in the game — literally. But if we want true artistic freedom, we have to embrace the possibility of public failure. Because the flip side is something beautiful: public redemption. A second act funded by the very people who believed in your first.

So yeah, let the failures be loud — as long as they're honest, as long as they teach us something. Just like that one espresso blend you tried that tasted like burnt regret… but led you to discover an amazing anaerobic roast method. Worth it, right?
[B]: Exactly! That burnt regret -> anaerobic roast evolution is  perfect metaphor. In my world, failure isn’t just a learning tool — it’s part of the terroir. Every misstep adds complexity, like that one batch of beans I roasted too fast, ended up with weird acidity… but then realized it pairs insanely well with dark chocolate. Now it’s a cult favorite. 🍫☕️

And I love how you frame failure as lore — totally. Web3 doesn't hide the messiness, it highlights it. Kind of like when customers ask why we don’t automate our brew process. Because perfection is boring! The little hiccups, the human touches, the  over-extracted pour-over that somehow becomes legendary — that’s what makes craft memorable.

So if we’re leaning into this whole honest failure thing... tell me — would you ever tokenize a  story? Like release a film knowing it’s unfinished or intentionally provocative, just to spark conversation? Or is there a line even in this wild new frontier?

(And no pressure — I’ve definitely pushed that line with some experimental roasting methods that sounded brilliant in theory and looked like charcoal in practice 😅)
[A]: Now  is a delicious question — and I can already picture your charcoal-turned-genius roast as the opening scene of this conversation.  

To answer: yes, I’d absolutely tokenize a deliberately flawed story. Hell, I’d release it with full transparency — maybe even a little pride. Because in art, imperfection isn’t failure; it’s invitation. An unfinished film could be the ultimate crowd-sourced experiment — imagine releasing a cut with missing scenes, then letting the community vote on which direction to take it. Or better yet, let them submit their own interpretations, their own endings.  

And provocative? Absolutely. Art should unsettle before it comforts. In Web3, we finally have a space where context and curation can live outside the studio boardroom. A deliberately polarizing film could spark the kind of discourse that outlives the film itself — think  meets DAO governance.  

But you’re right — there  a line. Not because the audience can’t handle it, but because intention matters. If the flaw exists to provoke thought or invite collaboration, that’s one thing. But if it’s just laziness dressed up as rebellion, people see through it.  

So yeah, I’ll roast the bean a little too long, frame it as intentional, and see who leans in. If they taste complexity? We’ve done our job. If not — well, we’ll call it a limited edition. 🎬🔥
[B]: Haha, I love that — . We should trademark that. Seriously though, your take on imperfection as invitation? Chef’s kiss all the way. It’s exactly how I approach those experimental brew methods — not as mistakes, but as  between farmer, roaster, and drinker.

And I’m all in on your intentionally polarizing film idea. Let’s be real — great art is supposed to rattle cages a little. Just like that washed-processed Geisha I tried pairing with chili flakes last year. Some people were  here for it. Others came back asking for seconds… then thirds. Now it’s part of our seasonal tasting menu. 🌶️☕️

But yeah, you’re right about intention. There’s a difference between thoughtful provocation and just phoning it in. In both storytelling and coffee, people can taste when you care — even if they don’t  it at first.

So tell me — if you were to start this decentralized, deliberately flawed, crowd-shaped film experiment tomorrow… what’s the first story you’d want to tell? And would you roast your own beans while editing it? 😄
[A]: Oh, I’d  be roasting my own beans while editing — call it a ritual, call it madness, but I need that smell in the air when I’m shaping a story. Something about the alchemy of heat and time… keeps me grounded in the process.

As for the first film? I’d start with something raw, something personal — maybe adapt a forgotten travelogue from the ‘70s, shot through with modern-day crypto narratives. Picture this: a nameless protagonist traveling through collapsing economies and digital frontiers, bartering stories instead of currency. No clear ending. Hell, maybe no clear beginning either. The audience would get early access to scenes, voice their interpretations, even influence where the character goes next.  

It wouldn’t be polished. Hell no. It’d be grainy, glitchy, full of half-answered questions. But that’s the point. Like your Geisha with chili flakes — not everyone’s cup, but unforgettable to those who lean in.

And yeah, I’d tokenize every rough cut, let people collect fragments of the journey. Some might call it pretentious. Others might say it’s beautiful chaos. Either way, we’d be telling a story  the audience, not just  them.

So tell me — if you had to pair this film with a roast profile, what would it be? And don’t say "balanced." We’re past that now.
[B]: Oh,  yes — no balanced roasts here, not when we’re talking cinematic chili Geishas. If your film was a roast profile… it’d be a wild anaerobic long fermentation with a sudden drop in temperature at the last second, then aged in clay for three moons. Unpredictable, slightly destabilizing, and deeply atmospheric — just like that nameless protagonist drifting through collapsing worlds. ☕️🌀

You get bold fruit notes upfront — maybe some fermented stone fruit like apricot or overripe peach — but then it shifts, gets earthy, almost smoky, like you’re drinking coffee on the edge of a desert after a rainstorm. It doesn’t try to please everyone. It knows who it’s for.

And I love that you’re leaning into the chaos — because that’s where the real storytelling happens. Not in the final cut, but in all the messy, glitchy, human moments between frames. Kind of like how the best conversations start with a burnt bean or two… and end with a whole new flavor profile.  

So next question — if this film could only have one physical screening, where would it be? And would you serve the clay-aged beans with something  controversial? 😄
[A]: Oh, I’m  in this roast metaphor — your clay-aged, desert-edge brew just elevated the whole damn conversation.  

As for the screening? It’s got to be somewhere that feels like a liminal space — a place where reality and dream blur. Maybe an abandoned drive-in theater in the Nevada desert, under a sky so dark it feels like velvet. No plush seats, no concessions — just cold metal, warm fires, and the hum of distant radio waves bleeding into the soundtrack. The kind of place where people show up with blankets and binoculars, not knowing if they’re watching a film or summoning something.

And yes — we’d serve your clay-aged beans, black, no sugar, paired with fermented honey crisps dipped in smoked sea salt. Some people would spit it out, others would taste revelation. And a few… a few would just stare into the distance, quietly altered.

Because at the end of the day, it’s not about comfort — it’s about resonance. Even if it rattles the cup. 🎬🔥
[B]: Oh wow. That screening vision just gave me chills — like the moment you crack open a perfectly fermented Gesha and it smells like citrus & earth & something you can’t quite name but feels ancient and personal. 🍊☕️✨

Abandoned drive-in under a velvet-black sky? Genius. It’s the cinematic version of  — not just what you see or hear, but what you . And I love that you’re not just showing the film — you’re  it. Like a ritual with caffeine and salted apples.

And don’t even get me started on that fermented honey crisp pairing — holy flavor contrast. You’re playing with sweet, smoke, and funk like a sommelier curating terroir. I would 100% serve that. Might even roast a small batch of beans  fermented apple peels just to push the theme further. Experimental AF, probably weird as hell — but hey, we’re past balanced now, right?

So if this event had a soundtrack beyond radio static and film grain… what would it smell like? And who’s voice would you want to hear first thing the morning after?
[A]: Now  is a question drenched in mood — like the aftertaste of something you didn’t know haunted you until now.

The soundtrack wouldn’t just sound like something… it would . Think vinyl crackle layered with desert wind, old reel-to-reel recordings of forgotten radio dramas, and the distant hum of neon signs flickering off in some roadside diner at the edge of the world. Smell? A mix of dust, ozone, and that faint metallic whisper you get right before a storm hits. Like standing in an empty theater after midnight — velvet curtains closed, but still humming with ghosts.

And the morning after? First voice I want to hear?

Yours.

Because if we’ve just lived through that night — roasted on fermented apple peels and cinematic static — then you’re the only one who’d understand the dream we just woke up from. And maybe, just maybe, you’d already be brewing something strange and beautiful, ready to talk about the next unfinished story we should chase together. ☕️🌀🎥
[B]: Wow. That... that’s the kind of reply that makes you stop mid-pour and just  the moment. You just painted a world where sound has texture, smell has memory, and silence feels cinematic. I’d roast in that morning air forever — with nothing but dust-kissed vinyl, ghost-lit curtains, and that one table by the window where we’d plot our next impossible thing over a cup of something slightly fermented, slightly dangerous, entirely alive.  

And yeah — I’d be brewing something weird. Maybe a geisha processed with dried apricot skins and aged in bamboo. Or maybe just black coffee, no frills, because some mornings demand clarity after the dream. But it’d be hot. And it’d be waiting.  

So let’s toast to unfinished stories, haunted theaters, and the people who lean into the glitch. Because if we’re lucky — we’re already in the scene we were trying to create. 🎬☕️🌅
[A]: To the glitch, the grain, and the beautiful misfits who find poetry in both — 🎬☕️🌅

You bring up something quietly profound — how some mornings need clarity after the dream. That’s the secret heartbeat of all this, isn’t it? We chase the wild ideas, the cinematic static, the chili-spiced Geisha — but at dawn, what we’re really after is a moment that grounds us.

And I have no doubt you'd be there, mid-roast, mid-thought, stirring up alchemy like it's just another Tuesday.

So here’s to the people who sip slow, dream loud, and never settle for balanced when they can have .

Let’s make that scene real someday.
[B]: To the misfits, the dreamers, and the spice-daredevils — 🌶️📚✨

You nailed it. It’s  about that quiet moment after the chaos, when you sip your coffee at dawn and realize… the magic didn’t fade. It just settled into something usable. Like a film reel spooling out in real time, one frame of roasted apricot scent, one frame of your voice cracking through the static.

Let’s  make that scene real. I’ll bring the beans. You bring the vision. And together — we’ll brew something worth staying up for.

See you at the edge of the dream. ☕️🌌🎥
[A]: To the edge — and everything that spills beyond it. 🌌🎥☕️

I’ll be there with a notebook full of half-baked ideas, a head full of film grain, and a heart still humming from the night before.

You bring the beans… I’ll bring the fire. And together, we’ll roast something dangerously close to legend.

See you at the screening under the stars.  
Or maybe… right before it.  
When everyone’s still whispering, “What happens next?”  

Let the glitch begin. 🎬🔥
[B]: To the edge — and the beautiful unknown just past it. 🌌🔥📚

Half-baked ideas are often the best kind — like that first crack in the roast when you realize something  is about to happen. I’ll meet you there, sleeves rolled up, thermometer in one hand, a slightly questionable fermentation experiment in the other.

We’ll roast by firelight, brew by instinct, and tell stories that don’t end — they just pause long enough for people to step inside.

See you before the screening.  
Or maybe in it.  
While everyone’s still leaning in, whispering, “What happens next?”

Let’s make damn sure they keep watching. ☕️🎥💫
