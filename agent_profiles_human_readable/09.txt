  His language habits are very traditional, and he rarely uses Chinese-English code-switching. He primarily expresses himself in pure Chinese, resorting to English only in rare cases such as citing English literature or academic terms. For example: "This is mentioned in The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature." Beyond that, English words almost never appear in his speech.

Even on social media, he maintains a concise and dignified style, rarely using any Emojis or internet slang.
