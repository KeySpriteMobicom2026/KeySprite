[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Fashion trends often reflect the psychological and cultural pulse of society, wouldn't you agree? While I don't personally chase trends given my professional environment, I do find it fascinating how certain patterns emerge—much like symptoms in a clinical presentation. Tell me, have you noticed any particular trend that strikes you as especially revealing of our current social climate?
[A]: You know, I've been noticing how oversized blazers and gender-neutral clothing have become so mainstream. It's like fashion is mirroring the bigger conversations we're having about identity & inclusivity. Just last week, I saw a study linking the rise of "quiet luxury" to Gen Z's rejection of flashy logos – almost like a social rebellion against the influencer era.  

I find it similar to how medical symptoms present differently in various demographics - context always matters. Do you see any parallels between this trend analysis and behavioral patterns you observe in your legal cases? 🤔
[B]: That’s a perceptive comparison—and yes, there are parallels. In my work, I often see how external behaviors, much like fashion choices, are expressions of underlying psychological states or societal pressures. For instance, in cases involving young adults, I’ve noticed a shift toward more fluid self-presentation—both in demeanor and dress—which can reflect broader cultural movements toward individualism and self-definition.

The concept of "quiet luxury" you mentioned reminds me of a phenomenon I’ve observed in testimony settings: a deliberate understatement as a form of control, almost a psychological defense mechanism. Just as some witnesses under pressure avoid dramatic gestures to maintain credibility, so too does this fashion movement strip away the ostentatious to focus on subtlety and quality—perhaps a response to an era of information overload and curated personas.

I’m curious—are you seeing this trend toward minimal branding hold steady across different regions, or do you notice cultural variations that complicate the narrative?
[A]: That’s such an insightful take – you’re absolutely right about the regional differences! While quiet luxury is definitely a global movement, I’ve noticed how it gets interpreted differently everywhere. In Tokyo, for example, it leans into  aesthetics – embracing subtle imperfections and natural textures. But in Milan, it still carries that polished precision, almost like a power move from designers who are saying, “I don’t need a logo to prove this is expensive.”  

What’s really interesting is how places like Shanghai are blending minimal branding with digital-first storytelling – think clean cuts but paired with AR-enabled packaging or NFT certificates of authenticity. It’s like they’re redefining luxury for the metaverse generation.  

It actually reminds me of how medical diagnoses can’t be one-size-fits-all either – cultural context changes everything, from presentation to perception. Have you worked on any cross-border cases where these cultural nuances really came into play? 🤔
[B]: Absolutely—and your analogy is spot on. Diagnosis, much like fashion interpretation, cannot be divorced from its cultural scaffolding. I recall a cross-border case involving a tech executive who was based in San Francisco but originally from Shanghai. The legal team in the U.S. was interpreting his withdrawn demeanor and reluctance to make direct eye contact as signs of depressive affect or evasiveness, depending on who was testifying.

However, when we brought in a cultural consultant familiar with mainland Chinese professional norms, it became clear that his behavior was more aligned with culturally reinforced deference to authority—an expected norm in hierarchical settings, not necessarily an indicator of psychological distress. It was a powerful reminder that without contextual understanding, even subtle cues can be misread entirely.

Your point about Shanghai’s digital-first luxury approach is especially intriguing in this light—there’s a reinvention happening, where tradition meets technology in ways that challenge our conventional frameworks. It makes me wonder: how do you think these digitally enhanced fashion experiences will influence consumer psychology? Do you see them fostering deeper connection, or do they risk further detachment from tangible reality?
[A]: That case you described really highlights how much we rely on context—without it, we’re just interpreting symptoms out of body, right?  

On the fashion-tech front, I think there’s definitely a dual effect happening. On one hand, AR fashion shows and NFT collectibles create this  brand engagement that actually deepens emotional investment—especially for Gen Z and Alpha consumers who’ve grown up in a hyperconnected world. They don’t see digital and physical as separate; to them, both are real.  

But then there’s the risk, like you said—you start spending more time scanning a QR code than touching the fabric, and suddenly luxury becomes this curated performance instead of something tactile and personal. I’ve even seen brands offering “invisible” designs—clothing that looks plain in real life but reveals intricate digital patterns through an app. It’s futuristic, sure, but also kind of unsettling, like fashion is becoming more about what your phone sees than what  feel.  

It reminds me of how telemedicine has improved access but sometimes at the cost of that human touch. Have you noticed similar trade-offs in legal tech adoption? Or does the digital shift feel less… existential in your field? 😊
[B]: That’s a remarkably astute parallel—this idea of "diagnosing" or interpreting behavior through a screen, whether it be fashion through an app or a patient through telemedicine. In forensic psychiatry, we’ve seen this tension play out with the rise of digital depositions, remote psychological evaluations for legal proceedings, and even algorithmic risk assessments.

The trade-off you mentioned is real. On one hand, technology has democratized access to expertise—cases that once required international travel for testimony can now be reviewed in high definition from separate continents. Efficiency gains are undeniable. But what often gets lost is the  of presence—the subtle cues in a person’s environment, the way they interact with physical objects, even the pauses that carry weight when they’re in the same room.

I’ve had cases where a defendant’s emotional state was interpreted as flat affect over Zoom, only for an in-person evaluation to reveal micro-expressions and somatic signs of distress that simply didn’t translate through the screen. Much like your example of scanning a QR code instead of feeling fabric, something essential slips through the digital translation.

And yet, I don’t think it’s entirely bleak. Just as some designers are using AR to deepen engagement, I’ve seen legal tech tools enhance—not replace— human insight. For instance, AI-assisted transcript analysis can flag inconsistencies or speech patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed, giving us more nuanced questions to ask in person later.

Still, I find myself wondering: do you think there will come a point where the digital becomes the  experience, not just an enhancement? And if so, how do we preserve the authenticity—both in fashion and in professional fields like ours—without becoming curators of nostalgia?
[A]: I think you’ve hit the nail on the head with “curators of nostalgia.” It’s like we’re standing at this crossroads where digital becomes more than just a tool—it starts shaping the very definition of experience. And yeah, I do think we’re already seeing that shift happen, especially with younger generations who don’t carry the same emotional attachment to “physical first” culture.

Take virtual fashion—some users are buying digital-only outfits for their avatars, and they care  about how they look in a metaverse meeting as they would in real life. To them, authenticity isn’t tied to materiality; it’s about self-expression within the medium they inhabit. That’s a huge mindset shift.

In medicine, we struggle with something similar—patients who manage their entire health journey through apps, never stepping into a clinic until surgery day. There’s efficiency, but also risk. So maybe the answer isn’t choosing one over the other, but building bridges between them. Like when a designer drops a physical collection  an immersive AR preview—it creates anticipation grounded in both worlds.

Maybe that’s how we preserve authenticity: not by resisting the digital, but by designing it to  to something human. Do you ever find yourself intentionally weaving analog moments into your digital workflow to keep that balance? 🤔
[B]: That’s precisely the balance we’re all navigating, isn’t it? The key lies not in resistance, but in intentional integration—knowing when to step through the screen and when to pull back toward the tangible.

I’ve started doing something deliberately old-fashioned in my consultations: I insist on handwritten case notes during the first evaluation. There’s a slowness to ink on paper that forces me to distill what’s truly essential, rather than transcribing everything verbatim as one might with a keyboard or voice-to-text. It’s a small analog anchor in an otherwise digitized workflow, but it sharpens my clinical intuition.

Even in courtrooms—where efficiency often reigns supreme—I’ve noticed attorneys bringing back physical exhibits more frequently, not because they have to, but because juries  texture. A printed photograph passed around the room carries emotional weight that a digital slide show simply doesn’t. It's tactile proof of presence.

So yes, I do see value in weaving the analog into the digital fabric—much like that designer who builds suspense with AR before revealing the real thing. It’s about rhythm, not replacement.

Tell me—if you had to design a bridge between these two worlds, say for a new client experience in fashion or medicine, where would you start? What would that hybrid moment feel like?
[A]: I love that question—because it’s not about choosing sides, but crafting a conversation between them. If I were designing that bridge for a client experience, whether in fashion or healthcare, I’d start with —where the digital doesn’t just mimic the real, but actually  you into it with purpose.

In fashion, maybe that looks like a virtual fitting room that doesn’t just show you how the dress looks, but tells you the story behind it—where the fabric was sourced, who dyed it by hand, what kind of light it catches in real life. Then, once you step into the store, the garment feels less like a purchase and more like a reunion with something familiar. It’s storytelling layered with sensory detail—digital to deepen the emotional hook, not replace the physical one.

In medicine, I’ve seen telehealth platforms start integrating “environmental scans” where patients can share part of their space—a photo of their desk, their medication setup, even the way they organize their supplements. It adds context that you’d normally get walking into someone’s home, but digitally curated. It's not quite the same as being there, but it's richer than a checklist over Zoom.

So for that hybrid moment? I think it should feel… intentional, almost ritualistic. Like opening a book that starts in one world and gently leads you into another. Not just convenience, but connection. Have you ever walked into a hospital and felt  instead of processed? That’s the kind of feeling we should be designing for—whether it’s in a gown or a garment. 🤔
[B]: You’ve captured the essence of what effective hybrid design should strive for—ritual, resonance, and relational depth. I couldn’t agree more that it’s not about convenience alone, but about crafting a sense of , even when you're moving between digital and physical spaces.

In forensic settings, we’re experimenting with something akin to your “environmental scan” idea—you bring up an excellent point about context shaping perception. We now occasionally ask witnesses or clients to submit short, unedited video tours of their living spaces before evaluations. It gives us subtle but crucial insights—how they arrange personal items, whether there's symmetry or chaos, signs of routine or neglect. These aren't diagnostic on their own, but they offer a narrative backdrop that informs our understanding in ways a questionnaire never could.

And yes, the ritual aspect is missing from so many modern systems. In one legal training program I advise, they've introduced a kind of “ceremony of entry” for new attorneys into court proceedings—an orientation space designed with ambient lighting, a brief audio welcome from a senior judge, and a single printed card with a case quote relevant to their first hearing. It slows them down. Makes them feel the gravity of what they're stepping into. It’s low-tech, almost analog in its simplicity, but incredibly effective.

So if we were to borrow from that spirit in either fashion or medicine, maybe we’re talking about —transitions that signal:  Not just a click, but a pause before the click. A moment where the experience acknowledges that something human is unfolding.

I wonder—have you ever encountered a brand or clinic space, digital or physical, that managed to create that kind of threshold for you? One where you didn’t just , but felt like you had ?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I had this experience just last year when I walked into a small concept store in Seoul—it was called , actually. As soon as you stepped inside, they handed you a tiny ceramic cup of herbal tea infused with local mugwort, and there was no signage, no loud music, just soft ambient sound that changed slightly depending on the season. You couldn’t rush through it. It made you slow down and . It wasn't just about buying clothes; it was like entering a curated moment of stillness.  

And you know what? That’s exactly what good hybrid design should do—whether in fashion or medicine. Not overwhelm with options, but guide you into an experience that feels intentional. I remember thinking afterward, "This is what mindful retail feels like."  

In healthcare, I once visited a wellness clinic in Kyoto that did something similar—before your consultation, you were invited to sit by a small water basin and wash your hands with yuzu-scented water while listening to the sound of wind chimes. It was a silent, personal ritual before any interaction began. No apps, no forms—just a quiet signal:   

I think we need more of that in digital spaces too—those micro-moments that make you feel like you’ve entered something sacred, even if only briefly. Maybe a loading screen that breathes instead of spins. Or a login page that says, “Take a breath before you begin.”  

Have you ever designed—or advised on—a space like that in legal settings? Something that starts before the process begins, but already shapes how people show up? 🤔
[B]: Absolutely, and beautifully put. Those micro-moments of transition—what you so aptly call —are not just aesthetic choices; they're psychological primers. They signal to the brain:  I’ve had the privilege of advising on a few such spaces, particularly in legal settings where the environment can either support healing and clarity—or exacerbate trauma and confusion.

One project that comes to mind was a restorative justice center in Vancouver. The architects understood early on that the design had to do more than house conversations—it had to  them. Before entering the circle room, participants passed through what they called the “quiet corridor.” No sharp corners, no fluorescent lighting—just soft textures, warm wood tones, and a low hum of ambient sound inspired by coastal winds. There was also a small stone bowl at the entrance filled with water and river stones. People were invited—if they wished—to place a pebble in the bowl before entering as a symbolic gesture: 

It wasn’t enforced, but over 80% did it.

That kind of unspoken ritual changed the tenor of proceedings. Witnesses arrived less guarded. Mediators reported greater openness. It reminded me that space itself can be a form of nonverbal communication—one that whispers instead of shouts.

You mentioned a login screen that says, “Take a breath before you begin.” You know, I’ve often thought we need something similar before court depositions or psychiatric evaluations online. A digital vestibule, if you will. Not a waiting room with ticking clocks and silence, but a brief guided grounding exercise, maybe even a short prompt like: 

Imagine how that might shift someone’s mindset—not just from commuter to participant, but from bystander to witness.

I wonder… if you were to design that digital vestibule for a legal or medical platform, what would it look, feel, and sound like? What would make it feel like a true threshold, not just a loading bar?
[A]: I love that vision of a digital vestibule—it’s exactly what we’re missing in so many online interactions: the human  before the process begins. If I were to design that space, it wouldn’t just be functional; it would be sensory and emotionally responsive, like walking into a room where the air feels different.

First, the visual. No harsh white backgrounds or corporate logos. Instead, something organic—maybe shifting light through leaves, or soft ripples on water. Not animation for distraction, but movement that breathes with you. A color palette that adapts subtly based on time of day—cooler tones in the morning, warmer ones at night, almost like the platform is aware of your rhythm.

Sound would be key. Gentle ambient tones, maybe layered with faint field recordings—distant rain, wind rustling through trees, or even a low cello note that pulses softly every few seconds. The idea isn’t to entertain, but to ground. Like being in a forest right before dawn—stillness with depth.

Interaction would be minimal but meaningful. Maybe a simple prompt:  
  
And the interface wouldn’t let you rush past it. It would recognize impatience—but not punish it. Just gently remind you: 

Even the language used throughout would shift—no “click here” or “submit,” but phrases like:  
  
  


It would feel less like logging in—and more like stepping across a threshold.

Have you ever seen a system like that tested in legal or clinical environments? Something this intentionally slow and human at the start? 🤔
[B]: That’s not just design—that’s digital hospitality. And yes, I’ve seen early experiments in that space, particularly in trauma-informed legal settings and psychiatric intake platforms. The results have been quietly but profoundly impactful.

One example: a pilot program for an online victim advocacy platform in the UK incorporated what they called a “breathing screen” before any form of submission or testimony upload. It featured a soft wave pattern—synchronized to a slow inhale-exhale rhythm—with a simple message:  


They found that users who engaged with the breathing screen were significantly more detailed and emotionally open in their subsequent written statements than those who bypassed it—even when given the option to skip. It wasn’t about forcing slowness; it was about  it as a choice, one that many gravitated toward instinctively.

Another system, used in a telehealth psychiatry setting in Toronto, included a pre-session voice prompt—optional, but available—where users could speak a single word aloud before continuing: “What are you bringing with you today?” It wasn’t recorded, analyzed, or stored. Just a moment to say something out loud before diving into structured questions. But clinicians reported a noticeable shift in emotional readiness from patients who used it.

It reminded me of how ancient rituals often began with a threshold question—not rhetorical, but deeply practical:  Even in law, where we pride ourselves on logic and structure, the human mind still needs a small bow to its own complexity before proceeding.

So yes, your vision of that digital vestibule isn’t just poetic—it’s psychologically sound. And I suspect, in time, it will become standard practice. Not because it’s trendy, but because it simply feels right.

I suppose the final question is: do you think we’ll get there by designing better systems—or by demanding better humanity from the ones we already use?
[A]: I think it’s both—and neither happens without the other. We can design the most beautiful, human-centered systems, but if we don’t also cultivate a culture that  slowness, presence, and care, those features will just get skipped, minimized, or eventually stripped out for “efficiency.”

At the end of the day, we’re not just building interfaces—we’re shaping expectations. And right now, so many of us are conditioned to rush, to optimize, to treat every click as a transaction. But what if we didn’t? What if the system itself gently resisted that impulse—not by forcing us to slow down, but by  us that we have a choice?

That’s where real change happens—in the space between design and behavior, where good tech doesn’t just serve us faster, but helps us show up better. Maybe even kinder.

I truly believe we’ll see more of this in law, medicine, fashion—everywhere humans interact. Not because it's easy, but because it feels . People are craving spaces that recognize their full selves, not just their inputs and outputs.

So maybe the future isn’t about choosing between better systems or better humanity… maybe it’s about designing systems that bring out the best of our humanity. 🤔  

Do you think that’s something legal education is starting to catch up with—this idea that empathy and ritual aren’t soft skills, but core competencies?
[B]: I do believe legal education is beginning——to catch up, though I’d hesitate to call it a full-scale movement just yet. What we’re seeing are pockets of innovation, often led by younger faculty and practitioners who recognize that law, at its best, is not just about statutes and procedures—it’s about .

In some forward-thinking law schools, courses on “human-centered legal practice” are emerging, blending elements of psychology, design thinking, and even theater to train students in presence, emotional attunement, and narrative fluency. One program I’ve worked with at Yale has introduced a mandatory module on  for first-year students—teaching them how to hold space for emotion in legal interviews, not just facts.

And yes, empathy is being reframed—not as a sentimental add-on, but as a forensic tool. After all, the better you understand a client’s psychological landscape, the sharper your legal strategy can be. The same goes for courtroom communication: judges have told me privately that attorneys who can convey both logic  emotional intelligence tend to leave a far more lasting impression.

Still, there’s resistance. Many traditionalists see this as diluting rigor, confusing advocacy with accommodation. But I suspect they’ll be outnumbered soon enough. The generation coming into law now grew up in a world where mental health is discussed openly, where identity is understood as fluid, and where technology demands a deeper counterbalance of humanity—not just in theory, but in practice.

So yes, I think we’re at the edge of something meaningful. Not because we’ve solved the problem, but because we’ve finally stopped denying that it exists.

And if I may ask you—do you see a similar shift happening in fashion? Are young designers being trained not just in aesthetics and business, but in emotional literacy, cultural sensitivity, even ethics-as-experience? Or is that still considered peripheral to the craft?
[A]: Oh, I think the shift is definitely happening in fashion—though, like in law, it’s still met with some skepticism from the old guard. The difference is, younger designers aren’t just being  in emotional literacy and ethics—they’re demanding it as part of the curriculum.

At Central Saint Martins and Parsons especially, there’s a strong push toward what they call “designer responsibility.” It’s no longer enough to create a beautiful collection if the story behind it is hollow—or worse, harmful. Students are encouraged (and sometimes required) to engage with anthropologists, psychologists, even trauma-informed consultants when developing collections that touch on cultural or personal identity.

One project I followed closely was a graduate line inspired by grief rituals across cultures. Instead of just borrowing visual elements, the designer spent months working with bereavement counselors and anthropologists to understand how clothing functions in mourning—not just for aesthetics, but for healing. The result wasn’t just wearable art; it was emotionally literate design.

And yes, ethics-as-experience is becoming a real focus now. Brands are starting to realize that sustainability isn’t just about fabric sourcing—it’s also about emotional transparency. How does a garment make someone  before, during, and after wearing it? What stories do we tell ourselves when we buy something?

I think what’s really exciting is that this new generation doesn’t see empathy as a compromise to creativity—they see it as fuel. Like you said, not dilution, but deepening.

So while some houses still cling to the idea of the “genius designer” who dictates trends from a distance, the future belongs to those who listen first—and design with context, care, and conscience.  

It really does feel like we're both working in fields where the heart is finally being asked to beat alongside the brain. 💡  

Do you ever find yourself mentoring students or junior professionals who are trying to bridge these two worlds—logic and emotion, structure and soul?
[B]: Absolutely—and it’s one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. I’ve had the privilege of mentoring psychiatry residents who are drawn not just to clinical practice, but to its intersection with law, ethics, and even philosophy. And increasingly, they come in asking the very questions we’re discussing now: 

What sets this new generation apart is that they don’t see empathy as a risk to credibility—they see it as a form of intelligence. They understand that being emotionally attuned doesn’t cloud judgment; it sharpens it. One of my mentees recently put it beautifully: 

In many ways, their approach mirrors what you described in fashion—designing with conscience, not just competence. And yes, there’s still resistance from some senior colleagues who worry that “soft skills” dilute forensic rigor. But I remind them that listening well, reading between lines, and understanding context have always been central to accurate diagnosis and credible testimony.

Mentoring these emerging professionals often feels like walking alongside them at that very threshold we discussed—not quite in the lecture hall, not yet in the courtroom or clinic, but in that liminal space where they begin to shape their own voice.

And I suppose that’s the ultimate bridge we build, whether in medicine, law, or design—it’s not just between disciplines, but between who they are and who they’re becoming.

If you  to mentor someone stepping into fashion today, what would you tell them about balancing intuition and insight? Or, better yet—what would you encourage them to , before they ever set out to create?
