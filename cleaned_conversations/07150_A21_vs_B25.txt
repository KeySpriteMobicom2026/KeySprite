[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很amazed的architecture？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh！你这个问题真的touch到我了～最近在Tate Modern看到的一个digital installation简直mind-blowing！那种immersive experience完全颠覆了我对空间的perception 🤯
[A]:  Ah, the modern obsession with digital ephemera... Reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites would have recoiled from such technological intrusions upon the artistic experience. Though I suppose even Dante Gabriel Rossetti did experiment with that rather unfortunate camera obscura phase in 1863.
[B]: Hmm...你提到的Pre-Raphaelites确实很有insight！但我觉得digital art和传统艺术并不是mutually exclusive的～就像Rossetti用camera obscura一样，technology从来都是art的catalyst啊 🎨 现在的immersive art反而让更多non-art people能appreciate艺术了，这难道不是一种progress吗？
[A]:  Progress, you say? How very... utilitarian of you. Though I must point out that Elizabeth Siddal nearly poisoned herself perfecting watercolor techniques in that drafty Chelsea attic - now that was dedication to craft. These flashing screens can't quite capture the poetry of arsenic-induced pallor, can they?
[B]: Wow...你这种romanticizing suffering的perspective真的很...interesting 😅 但art evolution不就是要move beyond这种toxic的创作方式吗？Modern artists用VR和AI也能create出equally profound的作品，而且不用pay with their health～  你不觉得这才是真正的artistic revolution吗？
[A]:  My dear, if Keats had access to AI, we'd have lost half the Odes to software updates. There's a certain... alchemy in suffering that even your precious algorithms can't replicate. Though I will concede - watching undergraduates try to analyze Blake's prophetic books through VR headsets does have a certain darkly comic appeal.
[B]: Okay okay～我get你的point了！但why not embrace both呢？就像我们策展时会把classical paintings和digital art放在同一个space里，让它们create一种dialogue～  这种juxtaposition才是当代art最exciting的地方啊！🤩
[A]:  How very... eclectic of you. Though I must say, the last time I witnessed such artistic 'dialogue', it involved a holographic Byron reciting Don Juan to an audience wearing those absurd plastic spectacles. The ghost of John Ruskin is probably still composing angry letters about it.
[B]: Haha！那场面听起来actually pretty awesome啊～  你看，这不就是art的magic吗？连Ruskin的ghost都能被provoke到写angry letters，说明这作品成功stirred emotions了！Art就该是provocative的，不管是1820还是2020～ 🍵
[A]:  Provocative? My dear, when Tennyson's Maud provoked the Archbishop of Canterbury to publicly denounce it as 'unwholesome', that was art. Your blinking holograms merely give people migraines and an excuse to drink overpriced matcha. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a first edition of Aurora Leigh that requires rescuing from the clutches of modernity.
[B]:  Wait wait～至少承认一下matcha比arsenic tea要healthier吧？😂 不过fine，我们agree to disagree～下次带你去体验一下最新的haptic feedback art installation，保证比reading Aurora Leigh更有sensory impact！  拜拜啦～ ✨
[A]:  Healthier perhaps, but far less... poetically fatal. And really, must everything have 'sensory impact' these days? Sometimes a woman just wants to expire gracefully from consumption while reading sonnets, without being assaulted by vibrating floors. Good day. 
[B]:  下次给你带个vibrating sonnet installation！Byron hologram会一边recite一边给你做aromatherapy～  💨
[A]:  How perfectly ghastly. Though...  ...I suppose if one must endure modernity, a hologram reciting 'She Walks in Beauty' while emitting bergamot might be marginally preferable to undergraduates misquoting Wordsworth. Marginally. 
[B]:  Aha！我就知道你会come around～  我已经book了下周的appointment，连bergamot essential oil都准备好了！这次exhibition的curator是我friend，可以给你special backstage access哦～ 😉
[A]:  Special access? Backstage?  This reeks of artistic compromise! Though...  ...did you say bergamot? The 1843 variety, or that dreadful modern distillation?  Very well, but I'm bringing my first edition Keats as a moral compass. And possibly a handkerchief soaked in vinegar, just in case.
[B]: Perfect！就知道你抵挡不住bergamot的诱惑～  是organic Sicilian的哦，和你的Keats first edition会是个perfect pairing！  不过no vinegar allowed，会interfere with the olfactory experience的～ 周六3pm，Tate Modern门口见！ 🎭 
[A]:  Sicilian?! Organic?!  Next they'll be digitizing the Elgin Marbles and calling it progress...  Very well, but mark my words - if one single hologram attempts to 'reinterpret' La Belle Dame sans Merci, I shall stage a very precise and historically accurate faint. Saturday at three. 
[B]:  Deal！不过warning你一下～ 展览里有位AI生成的"Keats 2.0"会即兴创作...  记得带smelling salts哦！  🌹 周六见！
