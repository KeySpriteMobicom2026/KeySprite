[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, while I appreciate the modern interest in plant-based diets, I must confess my culinary adventures tend to be rather... classical. Though I did recently discover that my rose bushes make for a delightful tisane. Have you read Brillat-Savarin's "The Physiology of Taste"? He makes rather fascinating observations about vegetarianism in early 19th century France.
[A]: How fascinating! I actually have a first edition of Brillat-Savarin's work in my office - though I must warn you, the binding is rather fragile after two centuries. His discussion of 'gastronomy as moral philosophy' reminds me of the Chinese concept of 养生 (yǎngshēng) in the Qing dynasty medical texts I've been studying.
[A]: Oh my! A first edition?  I do hope you keep it properly climate-controlled. The parallels between Western gastronomy and Eastern 养生 philosophies are indeed remarkable - both emphasize harmony, though one through pleasure and the other through discipline. Have you considered how this dichotomy reflects in Tolstoy's later works?
[A]: Ah, Tolstoy's vegetarian phase! Now there's an interesting intersection of ethics and aesthetics. His late-period rejection of meat mirrors the Buddhist influences in Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber" - though I suspect Lin Daiyu's delicate constitution had more to do with poetic melancholy than conscious dietary choices. Shall we discuss how food symbolism functions differently in these two literary traditions?
[A]: What a delightful observation! Though I must gently correct you - Lin Daiyu's dietary habits were more likely influenced by traditional Chinese medicine's 食疗 principles than Buddhist doctrine. But yes, the contrast between Tolstoy's didacticism and Cao Xueqin's lyrical symbolism is simply...  Shall we compare their treatment of fasting scenes? The Russian's stark moralism versus the Chinese poet's delicate melancholy?
[A]: Precisely! Though I must interject - while Tolstoy's fasting scenes are indeed moralistic, let's not forget Dostoevsky's treatment of the subject in "The Brothers Karamazov." His depiction of Father Zosima's asceticism bears striking resemblance to certain Daoist fasting practices described in "Journey to the West." Both employ food deprivation as spiritual metaphor, though with rather different theological underpinnings, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Ah, bringing Daoism into the conversation! The concept of 辟谷 (bìgǔ) does present fascinating parallels with Eastern Orthodox asceticism. Though I'd argue Zhuangzi's "fasting of the mind" is more concerned with metaphysical transcendence than Dostoevsky's earthly suffering. But tell me - have you noticed how both traditions use the imagery of simple foods like bread or rice to symbolize spiritual purity?
[A]: How perceptive! Though I must point out - while bread holds Eucharistic significance in Russian Orthodoxy, rice in Chinese literature often carries more... shall we say, earthly connotations. Consider the famous 'rice porridge' scene in Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" - hardly a symbol of purity, but rather of societal decay. But this reminds me, have you read Proust's madeleine alongside the Chinese literary trope of 乡愁 (xiāngchóu) evoked by childhood foods? The comparative possibilities are endless.
[A]:  My dear colleague, you've touched upon one of my favorite research threads! While Proust's madeleine represents involuntary memory, Chinese 乡愁 is often consciously cultivated through food - think of the mooncakes in Mid-Autumn poetry. Though I must say, your mention of Lu Xun brings us rather far from our original plant-based discussion...  Perhaps we should return to more... vegetative matters?
[A]: Ah, but literature and botany have always been intertwined! Consider Wordsworth's daffodils versus Tao Yuanming's chrysanthemums - both plant-based, both profoundly symbolic. Though I suspect if we served Wordsworth turnip soup like Tao's famous 采菊东篱下 scene, the Romantic poet might have composed rather different verses. Tell me, have you ever tried pairing literary analysis with actual herbology? My attempt at brewing Du Fu-inspired chrysanthemum tea was... educational, if not entirely successful.
[A]:  My own experiments with Keatsian nightshade tea proved equally... illuminating, though perhaps not in the way one might hope. But really, we mustn't confuse metaphor with materia medica - though I do keep a volume of Shennong's herbal classics next to my Complete Shakespeare. For purely academic comparison, of course.  Would you care for some rosehip infusion while we continue this discussion?
[A]: How thoughtful! Though I must decline - last time I combined rosehips with reading Tang dynasty poetry, I ended up annotating Li Bai's works with rather... enthusiastic ink splashes. A hazard of maintaining both literary and botanical passions, I fear. But tell me, have you compared the Western herbalism in Culpeper's works with Li Shizhen's 本草纲目? The cultural differences in classifying plants are as revealing as their literary treatments.
[A]: Ah, Li Shizhen! Now there's a man who understood that taxonomy is itself a form of poetry. Though I must say, Culpeper's astrological classifications make for rather more... colorful reading.  If only someone would compose a comparative concordance of these herbal traditions - perhaps with footnotes analyzing their influence on respective literary canons? Though I suspect such a project would require more lifetimes than even the 寿星 (Shòuxīng) could grant us.
[A]: Indeed! Though I often tell my graduate students that scholarship, like good tea, requires patience and precise measurements. Speaking of which - have you noticed how the Western 'language of flowers' differs from Chinese 花语? The peony's connotations of fleeting beauty versus Western associations with prosperity present such rich material for cross-cultural analysis. Perhaps over that rosehip infusion after all? 
[A]:  How could I refuse? Though I must warn you - my interpretation of 'precise measurements' tends to follow the Romantic poets' approach to meter: more intuitive than exact. And while we steep, let's consider this: isn't it fascinating how both traditions use floral symbolism, yet the peony's meaning inverted completely when it traveled West? Much like how Dante's rose became Tagore's lotus in Eastern receptions...  Careful, this cup holds centuries of literary cross-pollination.
[A]: Ah, your metaphor is as potent as ginseng! Though I'd argue Tagore's lotus owes more to his native Bengali traditions than Dante - but that's a discussion for another pot of tea.  To the eternal garden of comparative literature! May our scholarship, like these imaginary herbs, continue to blossom in unexpected directions. Now, about these rosehips - have you considered their symbolic role in medieval herbals versus Song dynasty pharmacopeias...?
[A]:  How delightfully esoteric! Though before we descend into that particular thicket, I must observe that the rosehip's dual identity - as both medicinal fruit and literary symbol - perfectly encapsulates our entire conversation. Much like how we academics pretend our herbal infusions are merely...  ...stimulants for scholarly discourse, when really we're all just chasing that Proustian moment of transcendent flavor. But do go on about the Song dynasty - I've been meaning to revisit Zhou Mi's 武林旧事 and its culinary descriptions...
[A]: Ah, Zhou Mi's nostalgic gastronomy! Though I find his descriptions of Hangzhou's markets rather more appetizing than his political commentaries.  But this reminds me - we've wandered quite far from our original plant-based discussion. Perhaps we should return to solid ground, lest we float away on these steeping metaphors? Though I must say, for a conversation that began with modern vegetarianism, we've cultivated quite a...  ...lush literary garden, haven't we?
[A]:  Indeed, we've come full circle - much like the seasons in a medieval book of hours. Though I suspect our digressions have been more nourishing than any mere dietary trend. After all, as Zhuangzi might say, we've been feasting on the 道 of literature rather than its material manifestations.  But these roses won't tend to themselves, and I've a seminar on Petrarch's laurels to prepare. Until our next scholarly... shall we say, harvest?
