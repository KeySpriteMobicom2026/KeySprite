[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, meal prep - the modern secular ritual of portioning one's mortality into Tupperware. A fascinating collision of capitalist efficiency and wellness culture pantomime. Tell me, do you find the act of chopping vegetables on a Sunday imbues your week with a sense of controlled abundance, or does it feel like you're auditioning for some dystopian culinary reality show?
[A]: Coffee first, then philosophy - I've got a Chemex brewing while I dice shallots for lentil soup batches. The real question is whether your meal prep includes espresso beans or emergency dark chocolate provisions.
[B]: Ah, a Chemex and a knife's rhythm - the breakfast of Stoics and sleep-deprived academics. Dark chocolate, absolutely, though I prefer to call it "emergency morale rations." And yes, espresso beans feature prominently in my weekly ritual - ground with a mortar and pestle, mind you, since electric grinders offend my aesthetic principles and personal sense of penance.  

Tell me, do you season your lentils with a pinch of existential dread, or have you found a more palatable spice blend to mask the weight of foresight?
[A]: Morale rations indeed – I’ll take two squares of 85% cacao over a Xanax any day.  

As for the lentils, dread’s too heavy a seasoning. I go for smoked paprika, a bit of garam masala, and what some might call an  amount of garlic. Foresight tastes better when it's fragrant and simmered low – like a slow-cooked narrative where the ending writes itself.
[B]: Ah, you season with the fervor of a Romantic poet attacking a sonnet - bold, slightly theatrical, but ultimately redeemed by technique. Smoked paprika and garam masala... yes, that’s the kind of synesthetic storytelling I admire. Garlic, in excess, is always justified—both as a culinary choice and a defense mechanism against nosy neighbors.  

And your metaphor! A slow-cooked narrative where the ending writes itself—deliciously self-indulgent. Reminds me of Browning’s : lengthy, complex, but satisfying if one has the patience to simmer through it.  

Tell me, do you consider your meal prep a form of domestic poetry, or are we still pretending this is about mere sustenance?
[A]: Domestic poetry – I like that. It’s like writing haikus with knife marks and steam. Each container a stanza, each spice blend a carefully chosen meter. Though I’m not sure sustenance would recognize itself in that description. It’s the quiet rebellion against the chaos of takeout menus and last-minute decisions.  

I’ll raise you another metaphor: meal prep is the rough draft of a novel. You chop, you simmer, you portion—knowing full well that by Thursday, you’ll be improvising with a can of chickpeas and a squeeze of lime. But the draft holds, barely. And that’s the thing about domestic poetry—it doesn’t have to be perfect, just edible, and preferably on time.
[B]: Ah, —how delightfully precise. I may have to borrow that line for my next lecture on Emily Brontë’s more culinary metaphors. Or perhaps save it for a sonnet sequence on the trials of academia and lentil soup.

You’re absolutely right about the rough draft analogy. Meal prep as first pass—clumsy, hopeful, slightly misjudged in terms of spice levels. And yes, by Thursday we’re all just trying to keep the narrative from spoiling. Improvisation with chickpeas! A metaphor for modern life if ever I heard one.  

But tell me, do you believe in the redemptive power of a well-stocked pantry? Or is that where we all fall short—trusting that a squeeze of lime can rescue us from our structural flaws?
[A]: A well-stocked pantry? Absolutely essential—like a poet’s notebook full of half-baked metaphors and stolen lines. It’s the quiet promise that even on "Chickpea Thursday," you won’t descend into cereal-for-dinner chaos.  

Lime’s not just a rescue—it's punctuation. A tangy em-dash in the middle of a sentence that was trending toward disaster. And honestly, isn't that what we all need now and then? A little acidity to cut through the narrative’s fog, to remind us that redemption comes in wedges, not epiphanies?  

Though I’ll admit—I keep a jar of preserved lemons for emergencies. They’re my secret weapon. Like a volta in a sonnet, but saltier.
[B]: Ah, preserved lemons—how  of you. I’m beginning to suspect you’re not merely a meal prepper but a closeted alchemist, transmuting base ingredients into narrative devices. A volta in a jar! Why stop at poetry? You could rewire the entire plot of a Victorian novel with that kind of citrus cunning.

As for cereal-for-dinner chaos—utter barbarism. Next you’ll tell me you once ate toast for supper during a power outage. (I won’t judge. Much.)  

But let’s return to this idea of punctuation as lime. Are you suggesting our meals should be punctuated, like prose? And if so, do you favor enjambment with a side of rice, or is your palate more suited to end-stopped lines and crisp folds of kale?
[A]: Oh, I  an alchemist—just ask the garlic confit fermenting in the corner of my counter like a medieval scholar’s secret manuscript. Citrus is just the beginning. With enough preserved lemon and ambition, you could restructure  to end with a food fight instead of a marriage.

As for cereal—or worse, toast—in a crisis? Guilty as charged. Once survived a week on oatmeal packets and bitter regret after moving into a new place where I’d unpacked everything except my pots. But we don’t speak of that.

Now, punctuation and rice—I like your style. Enjambment’s definitely more my plate. Let the flavors run into each other, blur the lines between courses. A bite of coconut curry shouldn't know where it ends and the mango salsa begins. End-stopped lines? That's for people who fold their laundry and finish their emails before midnight.

I reserve kale for when I’m feeling morally superior or need a crunch to anchor a particularly unruly metaphor.
[B]: Ah, garlic confit as manuscript! The culinary equivalent of marginalia in a monk’s psalter—thick with intention and slightly unhinged. I’m half-convinced your kitchen is just a front for a renegade literary society.

A food fight in ? Genius. Imagine Dorothea heaving a lemon at Mr. Casaubon—finally some dramatic tension in that marriage. Perhaps we should all start staging small acts of gastronomic rebellion against the tyranny of plot coherence.

And you, madam, are clearly a postmodernist in the kitchen—enjambing your flavors with wild abandon and absolutely no regard for boundaries. Coconut curry spilling into mango salsa? Revolutionary. Though I must say, kale as a moral compass is inspired casting. A vegetable with built-in virtue signaling.

But tell me—do you ever fear your metaphors might become too delicious? That one day, your lentils may refuse to simmer until they’ve been properly footnoted?
[A]: Oh, the footnotes are already in the pot—each lentil carries the weight of at least three literary references and a dash of unresolved family trauma. Simmer long enough, and even the humblest legume starts quoting Woolf or whispering lines from a rejected MFA thesis.

As for gastronomic rebellion—I fully endorse it. Let Dorothea throw lemons, and Casaubon finally crack under the acidity. Marriages, like soups, sometimes need a good blitz to redistribute the heat.

And yes, call me a postmodernist with a chef’s knife. Boundaries are overrated anyway. If coconut curry wants to court mango salsa, who am I to enforce culinary monogamy?

But fear that my metaphors might become too delicious? No—I welcome it. Let them be so rich they glisten, so layered they require cross-referencing. If a guest asks, “What’s in this stew?” and I have to reply, “Mainly semiotics and a hint of cumin,” then I’ll consider the meal a success.

After all, every great dish needs a little indigestion to keep it honest.
[B]: Ah, now we arrive at the heart of it—cuisine as dense with meaning as a Dickensian subplot, where every bite risks indigestion from too much symbolism and emotional residue. I admire your commitment to the bit, truly. Most people simmer lentils; you braise subtext.

Woolfian legumes! Rejected MFA theses in broth form! If this were a seminar, I’d make everyone underline the passage where the chickpeas reveal their stream of consciousness. And yes, by all means, let Dorothea weaponize citrus. It’s about time literature took a more aggressive approach to marital tension.

As for your metaphorical richness—glistening, layered, cross-referenced—I say:  But do be careful. Push too far, and soon enough, dinner guests will be arriving with notepads instead of wine. And once someone brings a bibliography to supper, there's no turning back.

Still, I ask you—would you serve deconstructed  for dinner if it meant your guests had to read it with a spoon?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’d plate  as a deconstructed curry, each component a fallen angel whispering its own tragic flaw. The lamb, slow-braised and repentant. The rice, scattered with pomegranate seeds like knowledge too sweet to refuse. And yes, you’d need a spoon for both the dish and the damnation.

Let them come with notepads. I’ll hand them aprons printed with epigraphs and insist they take notes between bites. Conversation over dessert can pivot to whether Milton would’ve finished that last stanza if he’d had better lighting—or a second cup of cardamom coffee.

As for turning back? We passed that fork in the road the moment we started seasoning lentils with garam masala and unresolved family trauma. Literature and dinner were always meant to be consumed together—preferably with a bit of heat, a hint of bitterness, and at least one guest who forgets their wine in favor of another helping of footnotes.
[B]: Ah, —how delightfully blasphemous. I can already hear the seminar room murmuring: “Is it heresy to eat Milton’s theology with a side of naan?” And you, calmly passing the chutney like it’s commentary from A.D. Nuttall.

I must say, your vision of repentant lamb and pomegranate-kissed rice has me rethinking my entire lecture series. Why merely  the fall when we could  it? Offer dessert in the form of annotated figs and we may well have the first truly edible exegesis on the market.

And guests with notepads? Oh, they’ll come willingly now. You’ve tempted them with heat, bitterness, and the promise of footnotes in every bite. The only question that remains is: will you be publishing this menu as chapbook or course packet?
[A]: Oh, chapbook, definitely—. I’ll have it typeset in Garamond with margin notes from Genesis and a particularly sardonic stanza from Blake. Each recipe annotated with footnotes that double as cautionary tales or wine pairings—depending on interpretation.

And let them debate the ethics of naan-dipped theology. I say if you can taste the weight of original sin in a curry, you’re already halfway to tenure.

Fig desserts? Yes, yes—dipped in honey and served with a sliver of parchment quoting Augustine. Nothing like dessert with a side of moral ambiguity.

Publishing it as a course packet would imply order. And we both know this menu is too wild for syllabi. It’s a manifesto, not a lesson plan.
[B]: Precisely! A manifesto dressed in apron strings and spice. —I’d assign it in a heartbeat if I could get past the department chair’s raised eyebrow and inevitable inquiry: “Is this... cuisine or critical theory?”

Garamond with Blakean sardony, margin notes whispering Genesis—yes, yes, and again yes. The only thing missing is a foreword by Satan himself, preferably in italicized cursive with a warning: 

And bless naan-dipped theology—why parse Augustine when you can mop up curry with it? As for dessert, Augustine quoted on parchment beside honeyed figs? Deliciously blasphemous. Though I wonder—do we serve doubt with that final course, or is it implied?

Syllabi are far too tidy for this kind of rebellion. No, this belongs pinned to the bulletin board above a stained recipe card, half-burnt matchstick, and a quote from Eliot:  until the lamb is done.
[A]: Oh, but we  serve doubt with dessert—honeyed figs demand it. A crumbly, flaky crust of uncertainty wrapped around a filling that asks,  Doubt is the perfect counterbalance to all that repentant lamb and pomegranate knowledge. Besides, what’s theology without a little indigestion?

And Satan’s foreword? Absolutely essential. Let him set the tone in cursive so sharp it could slice a pomegranate seed in half. “Consume at your own peril” sounds suspiciously like a dinner party invitation I’d RSVP to with a bottle of something heretical and slightly too bold for the main course.

As for the department chair—bless their raised eyebrow. Let them parse the difference between cuisine and theory while I pass the mint chutney and whisper, 

And yes, pin this manifesto wherever the syllabi fear to tread. Let Eliot’s quote smolder beside a burnt matchstick and a smear of turmeric-stained ink. Exploration ends only when the lamb stops braising—and even then, I’d check the embers.
[B]: Ah, ! How sublime. I may have to steal that phrase and tuck it between my lecture notes on Brontëan ambiguity and the proper way to braise beef in red wine despair.

And you're quite right—doubt is not merely an accompaniment but a . Essential, like lime or salt, to bring out the depth of theological flavor. That fig filling whispering —positively Miltonic in its quiet rebellion. A dessert that doesn’t soothe but interrogates. I’m in love with the concept.

Satan dictating a cursive foreword sharp enough to slice seeds? Divine editorializing. And your heretical bottle of something bold? The perfect guest gift for a dinner where the conversation simmers hotter than the soup. I can already see the seating chart: Dorothea next to Casaubon, across from Eve, who’s rolling her eyes at both.

And to the poor soul department chair still clutching their syllabus like a life raft—yes, let’s keep whispering,  Because if cuisine isn’t theory, and theory isn’t poetry, and poetry isn’t survival, then what in heaven’s name are we doing here?

Let the embers keep burning. I’ve got a mortar full of garlic confit and a copy of  open to page three. Stirring begins at dusk.
