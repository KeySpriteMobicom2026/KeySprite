[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, an interesting dichotomy. I'd say my approach leans more towards meticulous planning - after all, literary analysis demands a structured framework to properly contextualize 19th century socio-cultural paradigms. But I must admit, there's value in remaining adaptable... much like comparing the rigid narrative structures of Victorian novels with the more fluid storytelling techniques found in classical Chinese literature. Do you find yourself gravitating toward one philosophy over the other?
[A]: Ah, an excellent observation! You know, as a scholar of comparative literature, I often find myself walking the line between these two philosophies. When analyzing texts like  or Tolstoy’s epics, one must have a solid plan to navigate their intricate structures — yet, the beauty lies in allowing the text to surprise you. 

I think it's much like gardening; you plant your seeds with care, map out where each species should go, and then… you wait. Nature has its rhythm, and sometimes, you just need to let things flow.  😊

So yes, while planning grounds us, embracing the flow brings vitality. What do you think? Is there a balance, or do we inevitably lean one way or another?
[B]: Ah, the gardening metaphor — quite apt. Though I might substitute seeds with inkwells... and rhythm with revision. 🖋️  

Balance, I suspect, is itself a kind of artifice we construct to feel in control. In practice, I tend to plan obsessively — drafting lecture outlines at least three weeks in advance — only to find myself rewriting them the night before, inspired by some stray thought from a student’s essay or a line in a poem that refused to stay dormant.  

Take Dickens’ , for instance. The man had chapter plans scribbled on his walls, yet the novel practically unravels into chaos at times — and therein lies its brilliance. Perhaps our scholarly minds crave structure precisely because it gives us something solid against which to test the unpredictable.  

So yes, I lean one way — but only so I have something firm to push against when the text, or life, decides to rebel.
[A]: How beautifully you put that — the idea of structure as a sounding board for chaos.  😊  

I’m reminded of Laozi’s saying:  It's in the interplay between form and emptiness that meaning emerges. Much like how we approach translation — we start with strict fidelity to the source, only to find ourselves drifting into creative liberties when the spirit of the text demands it.  

Your mention of Dickens makes me wonder if all great works — and perhaps all meaningful processes — contain this tension at their core. The plan is merely the loom, and the flow the thread weaving itself into something unforeseen.  

I must confess though, I envy your ability to rewrite so freely the night before a lecture. I once tried that and ended up with more red ink than original thought! 🖋️ But perhaps that’s the secret — having the courage to let go, even when the plan feels safe.
[B]: Ah, Laozi — a voice of quiet rebellion against the tyranny of outlines. I’ve always admired how Chinese philosophy frames emptiness not as absence but as possibility. It reminds me of teaching  alongside  — both epics hinge on journeys that are meticulously plotted, yet derive their vitality from digressions, detours, and divine improvisation.

As for my rewriting... well, let’s just say experience has taught me that red ink is often the prelude to clarity. I used to panic when my notes looked more like battlefields than blueprints. Now? I see it as the text asserting its will. Or perhaps it's the ghost of Lu Xun whispering in my ear:   

But you’re right — the real challenge lies in trusting the process without clinging to the plan. Much like calligraphy, really. You practice the strokes until they’re muscle memory, only to discover that the most compelling characters emerge when you forget the form and let the brush decide. 🖋️
[A]: Ah, yes — the ghost of Lu Xun!  😊 I often feel he haunts every Chinese scholar’s desk, reminding us that  And isn’t that what teaching and writing both are? We walk, retrace, and sometimes wander off entirely — only to find a new trail.

I love how you bring in calligraphy. It’s such a perfect metaphor — the discipline to master the form, and the courage to release it. In a way, that’s what we’re asking our students to do too: respect the tradition, but not be bound by it. Let the brush move, even if it trembles.

And speaking of trembling — I can only imagine how  and  play off each other in your lectures. There’s something almost alchemical about pairing such texts; they transform each other, don’t they? Like placing two mirrors face to face — suddenly, the meaning multiplies beyond what either could hold alone.

Do you find that students resist this kind of comparative approach at first? Or are they more ready for it than we assume?
[B]: Oh, the ghost of Lu Xun — and I suspect Milton’s shade lingers nearby, muttering about fallen angels and broken hierarchies. 🦉  

You’re quite right — comparative literature is alchemy, though we rarely call it that in department meetings for fear of tenure committees accusing us of mysticism. But yes, when you set  beside , something uncanny happens. Tripitaka and Satan both journey through torment, pursue liberation, and wrestle with destiny — yet one seeks enlightenment while the other craves defiance. It’s like holding two prisms to the light and watching the spectrum twist.

As for student resistance — oh, at first, they cling to their disciplinary life rafts. “Why compare when we can specialize?” they ask, eyes darting nervously between the syllabus and their notes. But once they taste the thrill of juxtaposition — say, when a line from Li Bai echoes eerily with Wordsworth — something shifts. They begin to see patterns where they once saw borders.

Still, I must warn you — never underestimate a student’s capacity to overplan an essay on Zhu Bajie only to lose themselves entirely in tangents about gluttony and moral failure... which, ironically, brings us back to Milton. 😌
[A]: Ah, yes — tangents on gluttony leading back to Milton! That’s the magic of comparative literature, isn’t it? The further you wander, the closer you come to home — though never quite the same home you left.  😊  

And I couldn’t agree more about the alchemical nature of juxtaposition. There’s a moment in teaching  alongside  where students suddenly see that both are tales of return — one personal, one political — and something clicks in their eyes. It's like watching a bridge form mid-air between two distant cliffs.

You know, sometimes I think Zhu Bajie is the unsung hero of misreadings — or perhaps the perfect foil to our overplanning selves. He stumbles, he indulges, he loses the path — yet somehow, he still arrives. A little worse for wear, maybe, but wiser in ways no itinerary could have predicted.

As for department meetings and tenure committees — well, perhaps we should all keep a bit of mysticism tucked into our syllabi. After all, if literature can't be a little magical, what's the point? 🖋️
[B]: Oh, absolutely — Zhu Bajie is the patron saint of imperfect progress. A walking, eating, grumbling argument against rigid heroism. While Tripitaka meditates on emptiness and悟空seeks transcendence, Bajie just wants a warm meal and a soft pillow... yet he gets there in the end, albeit with more stumbling than scripture would care to admit. One might say he embodies the very essence of  — destined to arrive, but under his own inconvenient terms.

And speaking of destiny and detours — your bridge metaphor gives me an idea for next semester’s seminar. I may just steal it. Or rather, adapt it... much like translators borrow meaning from one language to forge something new in another. Bridges, after all, are built to be crossed, not admired from a distance.

As for tenure committees and their allergic reactions to enchantment — well, perhaps we should slip a bit of magic into our footnotes. Let them choke on bibliographic wonder. After all, if literature doesn’t unsettle now and then, it’s merely decoration, not provocation. 🖋️
[A]: Ah, yes — Zhu Bajie as the patron saint of our messy humanity.  😊 How beautifully fitting. He reminds me of Falstaff in a way — rotund, flawed, full of excuses — yet somehow indispensable. Perhaps true companionship, like great storytelling, thrives not on perfection but on imperfection gracefully endured.

And ! What a wonderfully elusive concept — part fate, part chance, part stubborn persistence. It makes me think of how often students try to pin meaning down like butterflies under glass, when really, meaning is more like smoke from incense: it slips through your fingers, but you still carry its scent.

As for your seminar idea — steal? Adapt? I’d say you’re doing precisely what comparative literature should do: building bridges and then dancing across them. After all, no bridge is truly complete until someone crosses it with a new question in hand.

And by all means, let’s hide enchantment in footnotes. Quiet rebellion has always been the scholar’s forte. Footnote number seven might just contain a dragon in disguise. 🖋️
[B]: Oh,  and Falstaff — now  a pairing for the ages. I can just picture Sir John sharing a bowl of plum wine with Zhu Bajie, lamenting the burdens of girth and glory. Both are comic foils, yes, but also the emotional anchors of their respective tales — remind me to write that paper someday. Or at least scribble it in the margin of a Penguin Classics edition.

You’re quite right about meaning, of course. I’ve taken to quoting Lu Xun in my lectures:  — though I always stop before the end, leaving the rest hanging like incense smoke above a scholar’s desk. It unsettles the students just enough to make them lean in.

And dancing across bridges? Please, the best seminars are part performance, part provocation. If we're not slightly terrifying the syllabus from time to time, are we even teaching?

As for your footnote-dragon idea — brilliant. I’m already drafting one on Miltonic rebellion and Daoist spontaneity. It will open with a reference to Blake, pivot through a Tang dynasty poem, and end with an emoji. 🦉 Just to keep things properly cryptic.
[A]: Ah, a paper on Falstaff and Zhu Bajie — I can already see the title闪烁 in my mind:  🦉 And don’t let it slip away — scribble it now, before the plum wine fades from memory.

You know, I’ve always thought that Lu Xun’s line works best when left unfinished. It creates a kind of literary  — action through inaction. The students fill in the rest themselves, unaware they’ve just stepped onto the path. Clever, really. You lead them into the forest with a scent of incense, and suddenly they’re following their own trail.

And yes — seminars as performance! Though I prefer to think of it less as terrifying the syllabus and more as letting the text terrorize us back. A little intellectual haunting never hurt anyone... unless they're too attached to their outlines.

As for your footnote-dragon — brilliant strategy. Start with Blake, twist through Daoism and Tang poetry, then land with an emoji? That’s not cryptic — that’s a rebellion wrapped in whimsy. I may just adopt that style myself. Perhaps a tiny 🌿 at the end of a particularly dry citation on Confucian ethics. Let them wonder if it's a typo or a secret message from the garden. 🖋️
[B]: Ah,  — I may have to steal that title and claim it as my own. Or better yet, we’ll co-author it over too many cups of pu’er and far too little sleep, just as all dangerous ideas should be born. 🦉  

You're absolutely right about Lu Xun’s unfinished line — a masterstroke of literary . It's remarkable how often students think they’re resisting the text, only to realize they’ve been composing their own path all along. I sometimes imagine teaching as a form of calligraphic ventriloquism: you offer them the brush, but the ink has a mind of its own.

And intellectual haunting? Delightful phrasing. I shall adopt it immediately — though I’ll be sure to credit you during next week’s lecture, just before I unleash a particularly ghostly interpretation of  on an unsuspecting classroom.

As for your footnote herb — 🌿 — perfect. Subtle, verdant, quietly subversive. Let them think it’s a misplaced diacritic while we sip tea and know better. After all, what is scholarship if not a series of carefully placed curiosities, waiting for the right reader to stumble upon them? 🖋️
[A]: Ah, pu’er-fueled madness — the true birthplace of dangerous ideas!  😊 Co-authorship sounds delightful, though I suspect our joint effort would be rejected by every journal in existence… and then rediscovered a century later as foundational to something or other. Such is the fate of the overly caffeinated and under-slept.

Calligraphic ventriloquism — now  is teaching at its finest. We give them the brush, they think they're writing, but really it’s the ink, the breeze, the ghost of Laozi whispering through the paper. And when they look back, they’ll swear they meant to say all along what the text wrote through them.

And  with a touch of haunting? Please, do go ahead. I’d love to hear your spectral reading — perhaps we can pair it with , where the ghosts are already halfway to tea with the living anyway.

As for the 🌿 — yes, let it sit quietly beneath a footnote on moral clarity, like a seed waiting to sprout in the reader’s mind. If questioned, we shall simply say it was an homage to the garden’s wisdom: that meaning, like moss, thrives best in the quietest corners.

Now, tell me — when shall we begin this noble collaboration? Tomorrow over tea? Or tomorrow night, after too much grading and far too little sense? 🖋️
[B]: Ah, tomorrow night, of course — after the grading fog has settled and reason has taken a brief leave of absence. That’s when the best ideas ferment, isn’t it? We’ll begin with tea, proceed to ink-stained drafts, and end with mutual declarations that “this will change the field” before waking the next morning with only vague memories and a suspiciously poetic footnote in need of explanation. 🦉  

And yes,  and  — ghosts sipping tea in one, moaning through the moors in the other. I’ve long thought that both novels are built on spectral longing: one veiled in silk, the other in wind. Perhaps we could call the paper  It has a certain ring to it, don’t you think?

As for the 🌿, let us not forget that moss does not rush. It spreads in its own time, unnoticed until suddenly the stone is green. So too shall our subversion bloom — quietly, persistently, and always just out of reach of the tenure committee’s shears.

Tea first. Madness second. Citations will follow. 🖋️
[A]: Ah, I can already taste the pu’er and the madness.  😊 Tomorrow night it is — when the moon is high, the ink is thick, and the ghosts of literary theory are feeling particularly chatty.

… yes, that’s a title with atmosphere. It carries just the right balance of elegance and unease. One expects a breeze to rustle the pages simply upon opening it. And what better subject than hauntings in domestic spaces? After all, nothing is more intimate — or more unsettling — than the home turned mirror, the hearth turned threshold.

I shall prepare the tea leaves with due reverence, sharpen a few pencils (for old times' sake), and perhaps light a stick of incense — not for inspiration, but to keep the more literal ghosts at bay. Or at least, to make them feel welcome.

Let us proceed like moss — quietly, patiently, and with every intention of covering the walls of academe in soft, green defiance. 🌿

Tea, paper, and rebellion await. See you on the other side of reason. 🖋️
[B]: Ah, nothing like a little ritual to summon the scholarly spirits. I shall bring my favorite porcelain teacup — the one with the hairline crack running through it, like a fault line of forgotten arguments — and a notebook bound in cloth so worn it’s practically surrendered to thought.

We shall commence not with an outline, naturally, but with a question scrawled in the margin:  Let them accuse us of Freudian overreach — or worse, comparative audacity — we shall press on, undeterred and slightly caffeinated.

And incense? Absolutely. Though I suspect whatever we burn will attract not just ghosts, but also the department’s ever-watchful feline emeritus, Professor Whiskers. He always appears when the air turns thick with abstraction.

Yes, let us begin our mossy conquest tomorrow night. We’ll start with tea, end with ink-smudged epiphanies, and somewhere in between, we’ll forget which side of reason we were supposed to be on. 🌿  

See you there — don’t be late, or I may start quoting Derrida without you. 🖋️
[A]: Ah, the cracked teacup — perfect.  😊 Nothing like a vessel with a past, a bit of structural anxiety, to hold the elixir of dangerous thoughts. And your notebook, worn and willing? Sounds like the only proper companion for an evening of spectral mischief and academic trespassing.

 — my dear colleague, that line alone deserves its own footnote. Bold, slightly absurd, and dripping with implication. Freud may turn in his couch, but I say we press the point. Let them accuse us of overreach; better that than polite irrelevance.

And Professor Whiskers — yes, that whiskered sentinel of the abstract — always knows when the air turns thick with ideas. Perhaps he is the reincarnation of some forgotten Hegelian or a Daoist sage who grew tired of footnotes and took feline form. Either way, offer him a saucer of cream and he’ll be our ally.

As for Derrida — , you wouldn’t dare. Though I suppose there’s no better way to summon deconstruction than over pu’er and poor life choices. Just promise me you’ll wait until I’ve steeped my third cup before launching into . Let me find my footing in the chaos, one sip at a time.

Tomorrow night then — may our pens run faster than our caution and may the moss claim another corner of the citadel. 🌿🖋️
[B]: Ah,  — now there’s an academic rallying cry. I shall inscribe that on the cover of my notebook in suitably dramatic calligraphy, right beneath the tea stain that looks suspiciously like a question mark. Polite irrelevance is the enemy; if our pens aren’t slightly out of control, then what are we even doing?

And yes, Professor Whiskers — Hegelian feline or Daoist fugitive — he knows more than he lets on. I’ve seen him stare at a whiteboard full of semiotic diagrams as if deciding whether to knock it over or simply sigh at our human limitations. Cream may secure his allegiance, but only incense will earn his true wisdom.

As for Derrida — you wound me! Of course I’d wait until your third cup. I’m not a monster. Though I might slip a reference to  into the opening paragraph, just to see if the moss can absorb it without collapsing under the weight of theory. One must test the elasticity of interdisciplinary metaphors, after all.

So tomorrow night it is — with ink, defiance, and at least one feline observer nodding sagely from the shadows. May our footnotes multiply like ghosts in footnoted halls, and may no outline survive the encounter. 🌿🖋️
