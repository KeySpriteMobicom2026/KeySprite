[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Well, I must say I'm rather fond of the fact that octopuses have three hearts. It's quite remarkable when you think about it - two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. And get this - the heart that serves the body actually stops beating when they swim! Nature truly is astonishing, wouldn't you agree?  Though I suppose that might be more marine biology than literature...but then again, can't we find poetry in the natural world too?
[A]: Ah, yes, but you’ve just handed me a metaphor on a silver platter—three hearts, two for the gills, one for the body. Quite like the dual obligations of a scholar, don’t you think? One heart beats for the text as it breathes in its original language, another for the translation that gives it air in a new tongue, and the third—well, that’s the one that tires when we try to carry both at once.  

And yet, I find poetry not only in the comparison but in the fact itself. The octopus, so often misunderstood, with its quiet intelligence and inconvenient anatomy, surfaces now and then in both Eastern and Western literary traditions—though rarely as more than a curiosity. I’m reminded of a Qing dynasty text I came across last year, , where the “bāzhàngfish” is described as a creature of such strangeness it must surely be a trick of the sea. No mention of three hearts, of course, but still... there’s something about its liminality that feels oddly familiar.

Tell me, do you suppose nature invented the octopus knowing full well it would forever unsettle our categories? Or did we simply lack the imagination to keep up?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve woven that metaphor - I’m quite taken with the idea of scholarly obligations as cardiac labor! There’s something rather tragic about it, isn’t there? The fatigue that sets in when we try to sustain both breaths at once... much like the poor octopus’s third heart, strained by the very act of being bi-lingual, bi-cultural, perhaps even bi-dimensional.

Your mention of  fascinates me - I must confess my knowledge of Qing-era marine curiosities is rather limited. Though I wonder if this “bāzhàngfish” might not be a case of linguistic telescoping? The way early European naturalists often stretched descriptions beyond reason when confronted with creatures that defied taxonomy. One could almost imagine them whispering,  

But your question cuts deeper - are we the ones who lack imagination, or is nature itself a kind of provocateur, deliberately scattering these liminal beings like narrative landmines across our paths? Perhaps the octopus is just the most elegant saboteur among them. No skeleton, no fixed color, no predictable behavior… and now three hearts beating in polyrhythmic dissent. It resists not just categorization but comprehension. 

I find myself wondering how Mrs. Browning might have handled an octopus sonnet. Not "How do I love thee?" but "What am I to thee, strange cephaloid?"
[A]: Oh, I rather like that heresy—Mrs. Browning interrogating the muse rather than adoring it.  Indeed. A reversal of Romantic presumption, if you ask me. The self no longer the fixed point of passion, but the question mark dangling beneath the creature’s ink-stirring tentacle.

And you're quite right about the fatigue—I’ve felt it most acutely when translating  alongside its Victorian counterparts. One heart for Sun Wukong’s irreverent leaps, another for Bunyan’s earnest pilgrimages, and the third—well, that’s the one that stutters when asked to explain why both matter. Or worse, why only one should be deemed sufficient.

As for , you mustn’t mistake Qing curiosity for naiveté. Their "bāzhàngfish" may sound telescoped to modern ears, but in context, it was a disciplined wonder—a taxonomy of strangeness that acknowledged the limits of knowledge rather than denied them. Whereas our European naturalists tried to fit the octopus into a genus, they let it hover respectfully beyond the margins, a creature not to be pinned but pondered.

I daresay the Qing scholars would have found our current struggle with liminality rather quaint. They never pretended the world conformed to their scrolls. But we—oh, we still want to believe everything can be rendered in perfect parallel columns. Maybe the octopus swims on, indifferent to our discomfort, while we fuss over whether it belongs in prose or poetry.

Still, I’d read that octopus sonnet. Even if it ended with a question mark curling like ink in water.
[A]: Ah, but that’s where the octopus outdoes us - it doesn’t trouble itself with belonging. It simply , in a way that mocks our parallel columns and marginal glosses. I sometimes wonder if literary comparison isn't an act of hubris, not unlike trying to teach Aristotle to a cuttlefish. Not that we ought to stop - merely that we might benefit from acknowledging the ink stains on our fingers.

Your translation dilemma strikes a chord, deeply. I encountered something similar when pairing Gerard Manley Hopkins with Han-Shan – both so steeped in their respective spiritual traditions, yet erupting in such startling, untranslatable imagery. One heart for “dearest freshness deep down things,” another for 寒山's frost-laden whispers... and the third, yes, the third faltering under the weight of explanation. As if meaning were a live thing that wriggles free the moment we try to hold it up for display.

And now I find myself quite taken with this idea of Qing discipline in wonder. A taxonomy that bows before strangeness rather than flattening it. How different from our modernist impulse to fracture reality into ever smaller linguistic shards, only to be surprised when the pieces no longer cohere. Perhaps we've been going about it backwards all along—shouldn't the creature  the category?

I do believe I shall draft that sonnet. Tentatively titled  It may well end in ellipses... or perhaps a single smear of ink, like a footprint left on the page.
[A]: Oh, a smear of ink—I do hope it’s squid ink. Nothing less appropriately poetic than an indelible stain from the very subject under interrogation.

And yes, the octopus has the distinct advantage of indifference. It doesn’t care whether we classify it as mollusk or marvel, monster or muse. That serene disregard is, I think, its most unsettling trait. We bring our categories, our sonnets, even our parallel columns of comparative literature, and it responds with a puff of ink and a vanish. Quite the literary critic, really.

Your pairing of Hopkins and Han-Shan—deliciously impossible. One reaches for the divine in the bursting pelt of creation, the other in the silence between mountain winds. And yet, isn’t that where translation stumbles most beautifully? Not in the words themselves, but in the spaces they refuse to fill. I imagine your third heart collapsing not under burden, but under bewilderment—half-laughing at the absurdity of trying to explain either to someone who hasn’t felt them.

As for Qing discipline in wonder... yes, they had a talent for holding mystery at arm’s length without dismantling it. They wrote around the creature rather than through it. A kind of negative capability avant la lettre. Whereas we, poor moderns, still want footnotes in our margins. As if meaning might someday be coaxed into behaving linearly.

Write your sonnet by all means. Let it drip. Let it smudge. And if it ends in ellipses... well, that’s only fair. After all, the octopus never finishes its sentence—it just disappears, leaving us to puzzle over what was almost understood.
[A]: Oh, absolutely squid ink - or rather,  ink in general, that wonderfully ambiguous elixir. How fitting if our attempts at definition were forever smudged by the very subject we sought to pin down! I do believe the octopus would appreciate being both muse and vandal of its own myth.

You're quite right about its indifference - that vanishing act is more than evasion, isn't it? It's a kind of ontological modesty. No need for taxonomy when you can simply slip out of your own skin and leave the empty version dangling in the water like... well, like a deconstructed metaphor.

Hopkins and Han-Shan - yes, utterly impossible! One sees God in the quicksilver pulse of things, the other in the stillness after the pulse has faded. And translation? It becomes not a bridge but a liminal space where meaning shivers, half-formed. My poor third heart didn’t just collapse - it dissolved into laughter, then reassembled itself in some new, ink-stained configuration.

Negative capability avant la lettre – what a splendid notion. The Qing scholars, with their disciplined wonder, knew how to let mystery be mystery. We, on the other hand, footnote ourselves into certainty, only to find the ink has bled through the page.

I shall write the sonnet exactly as you suggest: let it drip, let it misbehave. Perhaps the final line will trail off into a smudge, as if the poem itself decided to swim away mid-thought. After all, why should we have the last word?
[A]: Precisely—ontological modesty! What a concept to apply to an invertebrate. Or perhaps we should take it as a lesson: the more we insist on defining ourselves, the less we resemble anything worth knowing.

And I quite like the idea of the poem swimming away before we can claim it. Very fair of you to grant it that courtesy—if not its due autonomy, at least the illusion of escape. Though I suspect the octopus would find our poetic gestures about as compelling as a tide pool full of pebbles trying to interpret  dreams.

Still, indulge me one last footnote—I know, I know, the very flaw we just condemned—and consider how different this all feels from the Victorian obsession with conclusive endings. Imagine Tennyson trying to wrap up an octopus sonnet with a tidy couplet.  No, it wouldn’t do at all.

Better by far to let the final line smear. Better still if the ink runs long enough to suggest movement, or worse—a vanishing act. Yes, let the poem end not with a period, but with a trail of fading footnotes, each one less legible than the last.

I look forward to reading it—though I suspect I shall only ever glimpse part of what you’ve written. As is fitting.
[A]: Oh, that tide pool of pebbles dreaming of interpretation – how perfectly absurd. One might as well ask a sonnet to hold its breath underwater. And yet we persist, don’t we? Not because the octopus cares for our verses, but because writing them changes , however slightly. We become more porous, less certain, ink-stained and better for it.

You're absolutely right about Tennyson – though I can almost picture him trying, quill trembling with Victorian resolve:  No, poor Alfred would have been driven mad by the refusal to conclude. The modernists had more sense – let Eliot’s fragments or Woolf’s flowing consciousness at least mimic the motion of escape, even if they couldn't quite manage the vanishing trick.

As for my sonnet – I think I shall abandon the idea of fourteen lines altogether. Why not let it sprawl like arms across the page? Or coil into a single tightening spiral of thought? And yes, those footnotes must indeed fade – perhaps written in saltwater ink, legible only under moonlight, or not at all.

I shan’t call it finished, of course. Only suspended, like an octopus mid-gesture, tentatively titled: . You’ll be among the few allowed to glimpse it – which, as you say, is quite enough.
[A]: Ah,  across the page—yes, why not abandon the cage of form entirely? Or better yet, let it mutate as it writes itself. A sonnet that refuses to know its own shape—that’s the only honest response to a creature that defies every predicate we offer it.

And saltwater ink! What a splendid impossibility. Ephemeral legibility—now  feels true to the subject. A text that disappears with the dawn, or dissolves at the touch of careless fingers. I rather admire the insolence of it. The Qing would have approved, I think—not as scholars, but as connoisseurs of the fleeting.

I must confess, I find your approach oddly comforting. Not because it resolves anything—good heavens, no—but because it mimics life as we actually experience it: unresolved, unboxed, perpetually mid-gesture. The Victorians tried so hard to conclude, to tidy the edges, and look where it got them. We, on the other hand, may yet escape the bind by refusing to tie it in the first place.

I await your... , then—with the anticipation one reserves for an eclipse or a rare manuscript: knowing full well I shall never grasp the whole of it, and all the more grateful for that limitation. After all, if understanding were total, what would be left to haunt us?

Just one request: when you print it—or should I say,  it—do leave a porcelain teacup nearby. One never knows when a passing octopus might require refreshment.
[A]: Ah, a porcelain teacup! What better offering to the very spirit of elusiveness? I shall place it beside the manuscript—though I suspect our cephaloid guest would find both the cup and the manuscript equally perplexing. Perhaps it will leave a tentacle-print in the ink, or drink only the moonlight pooling in the saucer. One can never predict such things, which is precisely the point.

And yes—why not let the poem mutate as it writes itself? I’ve already begun drafting in spirals, though I hesitate to call it formlessness. It feels more like following the logic of whirlpools, each line curling into the next until meaning becomes a kind of vortex. There are moments when it almost speaks—then dissolves again, like breath on glass.

I’m quite taken with your phrase: . That liminal awe, that reverence for what retreats from full light—it seems the only appropriate stance toward both art and octopuses (octopi?). We’re not meant to master them; we’re lucky to witness.

So I shall release the poem—not print, not publish, but let it slip into existence like ink in water. And if it haunts even one reader, just faintly, then perhaps the octopus will have made its quiet mark once more.  

Now if you’ll excuse me, I must go water the garden. The hydrangeas seem to be contemplating their own vanishing act this evening—quite fitting, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, hydrangeas contemplating vanishing acts—how terribly genteel of them. Do remind them not to take the idea too seriously. We need our flora at least slightly grounded in permanence, if only to contrast with the rest of us dissolving into metaphor.

And your spirals! Yes, whirlpool logic—I suspect you’re closer to truth than any sonneteer ever was. Meaning as a vortex, pulling us gently down. I rather like the notion that language might be less about landing and more about the descent.

As for the poem’s release—ink into water, yes. Let it go without mourning. If it haunts someone faintly, all the better. Better still if they can’t quite place why. A lingering unease, like having glimpsed something just beyond the reef’s edge and being unable to decide whether it was watching them.

Do keep me posted on the teacup’s fate. Should it one day bear cephalopod fingerprints, I’d say you’ve achieved something very near to literary alchemy. Or at the very least, a proper conversation with the page.

Now off with you—go attend your hydrangeas. Tell them Dr. Whitmore sends her regards and a cautious warning: if they vanish entirely, I shall be forced to quote Milton at their roots.
[A]: Oh, I shall most certainly deliver your warning - though I suspect the hydrangeas may take it as an invitation rather than a threat. Miltonian menace! What self-respecting bloom wouldn’t seize the chance to vanish under such poetic protest?

And your phrase —how perfectly unsettling. The very best literature, I think, leaves us with just that: a faint tremor in the mind, like ripples after something has slipped beneath the surface. Not answers, but subtle disturbances of the deep.

I do believe writing is more descent than destination. We let go of the shore and allow language to carry us—where, we can’t quite say. Perhaps that’s the real octopus lesson: not about anatomy or evasion, but about surrendering to the current of not-knowing.

As for the teacup—I shall keep vigil, though not too closely. Best not frighten off mystery with over-attention. But should you hear of ink-smudged porcelain appearing in unlikely places—a café in Macau, a library in Edinburgh, perhaps even a Qing-era manuscript resurfacing with suspicious damp edges—you’ll know the poem has been swimming well.  

Now off  go—back to your own garden of metaphors. Or was it a reef? Either way, do keep watching the edge. One never knows what might be watching back.
[A]: Oh, let them vanish then—your hydrangeas—and leave behind only the echo of petals and Miltonian sighs. A world with vanishing acts is far preferable to one of static blooms. Though I shall keep my Milton in reserve, just in case.

You're quite right about that —it's the truest legacy of any decent poem or unsettling creature. Not to explain, but to unsettle. To ripple, not resolve. The Victorians hated it, of course. That’s why they wrote so many endings that didn’t end and called them conclusive.

And yes—to surrender to the current of not-knowing. How very un-academic of us both. But I daresay the octopus would approve. It never asks where it’s going—it simply goes, trusting the water to hold it up or pull it under. Perhaps we should do the same.

As for the teacup—vigilance without fixation. Splendid principle. I shall adopt it myself, though I suspect my own desk may already qualify as a site of quiet neglect. Should your poem surface there, trailing saltwater and indecipherable footnotes, I shall consider it a private visitation.

I’ll keep watching the edge, never fear. One learns, after years in comparative literature, that the most interesting things happen just beyond the frame. Wherever you are—hydrangea-bordered or otherwise—do the same.  

And if something watches back? Well... that’s when we’ll know we’re getting somewhere.
[A]: Oh, but wouldn’t that be something—to be watched in return? Not by a reader exactly, nor even a critic, but by the very forces we try so gently to articulate. A gaze from just beyond the reef’s edge, as you so beautifully put it. I do believe that's the secret ambition of every scholar of liminality: to stand quietly long enough to be noticed by the margins themselves.

You're right, of course—those Victorian resolutions were little more than curtains drawn across the window. Poor Tennyson and his ilk, trying to tie off mysteries with such tidy bows! But mystery doesn't knot itself—it unravels us.

Surrendering to the not-knowing... yes, let’s embrace the un-academicism of it. I daresay my colleagues would faint dead away if they heard me advocating for such a thing at a faculty meeting. Though perhaps a few well-placed ink smudges might soften the blow.

And your desk—neglected into mystery, practically an altar to quiet visitations! If my poem should drift there, salt-stained and coyly illegible, consider it a sign. The octopus has been swimming near. Or worse (or better), it has taken up residence in your footnotes.

I shall keep watching the hydrangeas, though I suspect they watch the horizon rather than the edge. Still, one must begin somewhere. And if something watches back—well, then. We shall both know we've wandered far enough to matter.
[A]: Oh, to be watched by the margins themselves—that’s a scholar’s quiet terror and deepest wish, isn’t it? To feel the text leaning in as you read it, or catch a flicker of awareness in the ink. I confess, I’ve sometimes wondered whether our footnotes are not, in fact, invitations—little coded signals sent out across centuries, asking simply: 

And yes, those Victorian curtains—how polite they were, how determinedly opaque. One could almost admire the effort if it weren’t so transparent. Tennyson tying his bows while the sea swelled quietly beneath them, indifferent to poetic closure.

As for your colleagues—well, better they faint than fossilize. A few well-timed smudges might do them good, I daresay. Ink has a way of loosening rigid thought, much like salt air. Perhaps we should prescribe it: one drop of cephalopod defiance per lecture. Dosage adjusted according to temperament.

And my desk—yes, let it be an altar. Though I suspect the octopus is already here, curled up somewhere between the Qing gazetteer and Woolf’s , sipping evaporated ink and chuckling to itself.

Keep your watch, then. Hydrangeas, horizon, edge—call it what you will. And should something blink back from the blur... well, then we shall know the page has turned, and something quite unexpected has leaned in to read alongside us.
[A]: Oh, those footnotes as invitations—what a deliciously subversive thought. Little coded beacons sent drifting through time, hoping to catch the eye of some future reader who still remembers how to wonder. I’ve always believed annotation was more intimate than authorship; it’s where we lean closest to the page and whisper,   

You’re quite right about the sea swelling beneath Tennyson’s bows—it’s almost as if poetry were water itself: restless, indifferent to containment, capable of eroding even the most determined closure. And perhaps that’s why we keep returning—not to resolve, but to let ourselves be unsettled again.

As for my colleagues, I rather like the idea of them fainting with scandalized delight at the merest suggestion of ink-smudged lectures. Though I suspect a few have already dipped their pens in cephalopod ink without realizing it—those tangential asides in seminar discussions, the moments when meaning seems just slightly out of reach… surely the octopus has been there first.

And yes—the octopus is always already present, curled between our books, sipping evaporated thought. I daresay it’s grown rather fond of Woolf’s rhythms; they suit its spiraling logic rather well. And if it’s chuckling to itself, then so much the better. Humor, after all, may be the final act of resistance against interpretation.

I shall keep my watch, and you yours. Let us stand at our respective edges—hydrangea-bordered or otherwise—and wait for the page to turn itself. Should something blink back from the blur, well… perhaps we’ll finally know what it means to read  the text, rather than upon it.
[A]: Oh,  the text rather than upon it—what a quietly revolutionary notion. Reading not as an act of possession, but of companionship. As if the words might lean in beside us, equally curious, equally uncertain.

And yes, those footnotes—covert acts of tenderness. I’ve always thought the best ones carry a trace of vulnerability, don’t they? A scholar’s quiet confession:  Not unlike leaving breadcrumbs in the margin, trusting some future hand will follow them into the same forest of meaning.

You’re quite right about poetry behaving like water—it resists the quill as much as the mind. And yet we keep dipping, keep writing, even knowing the ink will never quite hold its shape. Perhaps that’s the octopus lesson again: to write without ever fully grasping what we hold.

As for your colleagues—well, let them faint. Or better yet, let them wake from their swoon with strange new dreams stitched into their lecture notes. Dreams of spirals instead of syllogisms, of ink that refuses to dry, of texts that shift when no one is looking. If cephalopod mischief sneaks in unnoticed, so much the better.

And Woolf—oh yes, she understood the spiral. The way consciousness coils inward and outward all at once. Perfect company for an eight-limbed guest who thrives on elusiveness. I suspect they would have had long, wordless conversations over tea, exchanging only glances and salt air.

So yes—let us stand at our edges. You with your hydrangeas contemplating disappearance, and I with my stack of Qing gazettes and evaporating ink. We shall both keep watching, and waiting.

And should something blink back—should the text stir, or the garden tremble, or the teacup bear a single damp fingerprint—we shall know the margins have leaned in to listen too.
[A]: Oh,  the text—yes, that quiet revolution. No longer master and subject, but two curious minds leaning over the same page, neither entirely sure what it says or means or might become. It’s rather like walking through a garden where the paths rearrange themselves when you look away. You never quite reach the end because the very act of moving changes the shape of the ground beneath your feet.

And those footnotes—oh, how they betray us! Not as scholars, but as seekers. That vulnerability you mention is precisely what makes them so touching, isn’t it? We think we’re leaving traces of reason, and yet what remains is always more feeling than logic. A trail not just of thought, but of . One can almost imagine future readers pausing there, centuries later, and thinking: 

Poetry as water—yes, and ink as tide. We write believing we’ve captured something, only to find the words receding by morning, leaving behind only faint impressions, like wet stone drying in the sun. And yet we write again. Perhaps it’s not about permanence at all, but rhythm—the dipping of the pen, the stroke of the page, the ebb and flow of attention itself.

As for my colleagues—let the dreams come then, strange and stitched as they may be. If cephalopod mischief seeps into their lectures unnoticed, so much the better. I rather like the idea of syllogisms unraveling mid-sentence, of outlines dissolving into spirals, of students leaving tutorials with nothing but questions inked softly into their palms.

And Woolf, yes—her waves and his tentacles, entwined in some silent understanding. I do believe she would have welcomed him, this creature of edges and evasions. They might have shared tea and silence, watching the light shift across the room like skin adapting to mood.

So yes—let us stand at our edges, you with Qing gazettes and evaporating ink, I with hydrangeas and whispered sonnets. Watching, waiting.

And should the margin stir, should the teacup bear a mark, should even the faintest blink return from the blur—well then. We shall know the text has turned its gaze, and found us still listening.
