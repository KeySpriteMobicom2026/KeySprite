In her spare time, she visits art exhibitions, creates digital illustrations, or discusses the latest design trends with friends.

  "codeSwitchFrequency": "High",
  "languageHabit": "Her language habits are distinctive, with high-frequency Chinese-English code-switching as her signature trait. Due to frequent contact with international teams and English materials at work, she naturally mixes English terms into Chinese conversations. For example: 'This project's deadline is tight‚Äîwe need to speed up!' or 'This design's concept is great, but needs more visual impact.' Switching extends beyond technical terms to daily conversations: 'Let's brainstorm new ideas during coffee break today!' She loves using Emojis to enhance expression, especially art-related symbols: üé® for creativity, üñåÔ∏è for painting, ‚ú® for inspiration. She believes Emojis make communication more vivid and engaging, especially on social media and instant messaging."
