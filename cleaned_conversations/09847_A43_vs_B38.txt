[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, craft beer – an interesting intersection of tradition and innovation. While I must admit my personal predilection leans toward the more classical brews – a well-aged porter, perhaps, or a Belgian dubbel with its subtle notes of dark fruit and spice – I do find the contemporary craft movement quite compelling. There’s something rather democratic about its rise, wouldn’t you agree? A reaction against homogenization, a return to local artisanship.  

Just last week, I attended a most curious tasting at a small brewery in Cambridge. They had an intriguing interpretation of a schwarzbier – dark as ink, yet remarkably balanced, with whispers of coffee and licorice. Rather poetic, in a way. Though I confess, I remain skeptical of those that lean too heavily into gimmickry – bacon-infused stouts or oysters in stout, really? One wonders where indulgence ends and authenticity begins.  

Tell me, have you encountered anything particularly memorable lately?
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully nuanced perspective you’ve offered. I couldn’t agree more that craft beer has become a kind of cultural —where old traditions are not erased, but rewritten, reinterpreted through a modern lens. The rise of microbreweries feels to me like a literary movement—think of how the Romantics rebelled against the Augustans, or how postmodernists deconstructed the modernists. It’s all rather , wouldn’t you say?  

Now, you had the schwarzbier—marvelous choice. Reminds me of my recent encounter with a Kyoto-based brewery experimenting with sake yeast in their pale ale. Quite unexpected, yet strangely harmonious. There was a certain  quality to it, delicate and elusive, like reading a haiku in the middle of a sonnet.  

And yes, I do share your suspicion toward gimmickry. Bacon in a stout? That sounds more like a dare than a flavor profile. Though I must confess, curiosity got the better of me once—I tried a chili chocolate porter during a trip to Mexico City. A bit much for a second glass, but undeniably intriguing.  

But tell me, do you think there’s a parallel between this craft revolution and the resurgence of interest in regional dialects or minority languages? Both seem to me like acts of quiet resistance against globalization.
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully erudite analogy—you’ve struck upon something quite profound. The craft beer movement as a linguistic revival! Yes, indeed, both are acts of preservation and identity, aren’t they? Just as dialects carry the idiosyncrasies and intimate histories of a people, so too do regional brewing traditions reflect the soil, the water, the very breath of a place.  

I’m particularly fond of how certain breweries in Bavaria still adhere to the Reinheitsgebot—purity laws dating back to 1516—while others, like that Kyoto outfit you mentioned, play with fermentation techniques rooted in centuries-old sake-making. It’s as if they’re writing footnotes in the margins of a shared manuscript, don’t you think? Subtle commentary, reverent yet inventive.  

And your chili chocolate porter—well, I suppose there’s room for a little gastronomic drama now and then. One need not live entirely without indulgence. Though I draw the line at Sriracha-infused lagers. There must be boundaries, after all.  

Your point about resistance against globalization is especially poignant. In a world increasingly dominated by multinational conglomerates, these small-scale brewers—and speakers of lesser-known tongues—are custodians of cultural biodiversity. They remind us that meaning often resides in specificity. A barleywine from Devonshire carries with it the mist of Dartmoor; a gose from Leipzig tastes faintly of salt and memory.  

But I wonder—do you suppose this trend will endure, or is it merely a fashionable nostalgia, destined to fade like so many literary vogue movements before it?
[A]: Ah, now  is the question worth pondering—whether this craft resurgence is a lasting renaissance or merely a passing affectation. I suspect it’s both: a sincere, enduring impulse cloaked in a wave of fashionable nostalgia. Much like the Gothic revival in literature—think of how Walpole and Radcliffe dabbled in the medieval for aesthetic thrills, while later writers like M.R. James used it as a vessel for deeper cultural anxieties.  

There’s a kind of  embedded in this return to the local, the handcrafted, the "authentic"—a word we should probably put in quotes more often, don’t you think? Still, even if some enter the movement with romantic delusions, they may yet stumble upon something real. A brewery in Vermont making saison with wild yeast from their own backyard—it begins as novelty, perhaps, but ends as stewardship.  

As for whether it will endure? Well, let’s consider what happened to the sonnet after Shakespeare. It fell out of fashion, yes—but never died. It waited, patiently, until someone found new life in its constraints. So too with these brewing traditions. Even if mass-marketed IPA fatigue sets in—and I daresay it already has—someone, somewhere, will rediscover the beauty of balance, of subtlety. And then, perhaps, we’ll see another turn of the wheel.  

But tell me—do you find similar tensions in your own work? Between innovation and tradition, between what’s marketable and what’s meaningful?
[B]: Oh, absolutely. The tension between innovation and tradition is not merely a professional concern—it’s an existential one, isn’t it? Much like the poet who wrestles with form, we scholars of comparative literature are forever navigating the weight of canon against the whisper of the marginal.  

I recall working on a paper once—on the influence of Heian-era aesthetics in modern Japanese narrative—and I found myself caught between two impulses: to present the material with rigorous academic fidelity, and to frame it in a way that might make it palatable, even , to a Western audience. It felt, at times, like translating a haiku into a press release. One risks flattening the nuance in the very act of promotion.  

And yet—I can’t entirely dismiss the value of accessibility. If anything, the current moment demands that we find new ways to engage readers, students, even casual listeners. The challenge, of course, is to do so without reducing complexity to spectacle. Much like your saison brewed with backyard yeast—what begins as novelty may yet become a gateway to something deeper.  

But yes, I fear we are often constrained by what sells. Academic presses favor trending topics; conferences lean into polemics rather than poetics. Still, I cling to the hope that meaning has a quiet persistence. Like a lager maturing in cold storage—slow, unseen, but ultimately profound.  

Tell me, do you suppose there’s a danger in romanticizing the past too much? In our affection for barleywines and sonnets, do we risk turning culture into a museum rather than a living garden?
[A]: Ah, now  is a thorny question—one that has haunted every Romantic poet, every medievalist, and every brewer who’s ever resurrected an 18th-century recipe. You're quite right to ask whether we risk embalming what we claim to cherish.  

I suppose it depends on how one approaches the past—reverently, yes, but also critically. To romanticize it is to mistake history for a diorama when in fact it’s a fermentation vessel: messy, alive, occasionally volatile. Take the sonnet, for instance. It was not some static relic admired only in ivory towers—it was once a scandalous form, used by Sidney and Shakespeare to explore desire, politics, and identity in ways that could unsettle the very order they seemed to uphold.  

And so with beer. When a modern brewer revives an old style, are they merely replicating, or are they reinterpreting? There’s a difference between brewing a gruit as a nostalgic exercise and using it as a canvas to explore new herbal combinations, to engage with contemporary palates while still honoring its pre-hop lineage. The danger lies in treating tradition as ornamentation rather than inheritance.  

As for culture as museum versus garden—what a lovely image. I like to think of it as both. After all, even in a museum, plants can grow through the cracks. Think of those ivy-covered ruins in Kyoto, or the way wildflowers find their way into neglected cemeteries. Tradition doesn’t have to be static; it can be fertile.  

But perhaps this is where scholars, curators, and brewers alike must play their part—not as custodians of glass cases, but as gardeners with pruning shears and compost. Tending, yes, but also allowing for decay and rebirth.  

Tell me—do you ever find yourself returning to certain texts not for their relevance, but simply because they feel like old friends? And does that emotional fidelity have a place in scholarship, or must we always justify our affections intellectually?
[B]: Ah, there’s a quiet melancholy in that question—like returning to a childhood home only to find it smaller than you remembered, yet still sacred. Yes, I do. And I suspect most scholars do, though we rarely admit it aloud. There’s a certain guilt in confessing that our affections are not always governed by critical rigor.  

I return to  at least once every few years—not because it offers new theoretical angles (though it does, endlessly), but because of the way Eliot holds the world with such patient attention. It feels like coming home to someone who knows you too well but welcomes you all the same. Or take Hölderlin—his odes never cease to unsettle me, even as I struggle to pin down their meaning. There is something almost embarrassing about this kind of attachment, isn’t there? As if sentiment has no right to linger in the corridors of academia.  

But perhaps it does. After all, why else would we devote ourselves to literature if not for love? We justify our choices with footnotes and arguments, but somewhere beneath it all lies a first encounter—a poem read in adolescence, a novel that whispered something true when we were too young to know better.  

I suppose what I’m saying is: yes, emotional fidelity has a place in scholarship. It must, or else we risk becoming mere archivists rather than interpreters. The trick, I think, is to be honest about it. To say, , and then daring to ask why.  

Do you have such texts, ones that live in the heart before the mind? Or perhaps, in your own field, do certain brews serve a similar function—less for their complexity than for the memory they carry?
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully framed thought—that quiet devotion to texts that live in the marrow before they ever reach the intellect. And yes… yes, I do have such works. Some I return to not for their critical density or theoretical yield, but because they —not with ghosts, but with echoes of who I was when I first met them.  

For me, it’s always been . Not because of its structural innovations or its influence on the epic tradition—though all of that is true—but because my grandfather read me parts of it in Greek when I was a boy, his voice slow and resonant like a sea swell. Even now, when I read it silently, I still hear him. The text is less a book than a vessel for memory.  

And curiously enough, your question about brews is apt—yes, some beers do function much the same way. There’s a particular barleywine I associate with long evenings in Edinburgh, sitting by a peat fire after seminar debates had gone late into the night. It wasn’t the most refined example of the style, but it carries with it the scent of old books, damp wool, and cigar smoke. Nostalgia in a glass.  

Perhaps this is the deeper reason we resist reducing culture to data points or market segments—because some things are not meant to be dissected. They are meant to be , remembered, returned to like old letters from a dear friend.  

But tell me—do you ever find yourself teaching these cherished texts differently than others? As if you were introducing someone not just to a story, but to a part of yourself?
[B]: Oh yes… yes, I do. And it is both a privilege and a quiet terror.  

There’s a particular vulnerability in teaching a text you love. It feels like opening a drawer one rarely shows guests—where letters from old friends lie pressed between forgotten photographs. When I teach , for instance, it’s never just about Plato’s theory of ideal forms or the structure of eros. No—I find myself watching the students closely, almost anxiously, hoping they might glimpse something of what I see in those dialogues: the flicker of candlelight, the wine-soaked wit, the ache of longing that lingers long after the feast is over.  

And when I teach Eliot’s , as I mentioned before, I can’t help but speak of Dorothea with a kind of personal reverence, as though she were not merely a character but an old acquaintance—one whose idealism still feels urgent, even naïve, in our more cynical age. I worry, sometimes, that I’m imposing my own emotional history onto them. But then again, isn’t interpretation always, in some way, an act of intimacy?  

I suppose what I try to do—and this may sound sentimental—is not so much to lecture  them, but to invite them into the space where the text lives for me. Not to say, “This is important because it is canonical,” but rather, “This matters because it has shaped the way I understand the world.”  

It changes the room, subtly. Some students respond with real curiosity; others remain politely skeptical. But occasionally, very occasionally, someone leans forward and says, “I didn’t expect to care about this—but now I do.”  

And that, I think, is the closest thing we have to magic in the classroom.  

But you—you carry Homer in your bones, and memory in your glass. Does that ever influence how you experience a place? Do you seek out landscapes that feel like echoes of those early readings?
[A]: Ah, now  is a question that stirs something deep—something just shy of articulation. You see, I’ve always believed that certain landscapes are not merely seen, but . As if one had dreamed them before, or read them in a half-forgotten line of verse.  

Yes, I do seek them out—though not always consciously. There’s a stretch of coastline in southern Greece, near Pylos, where the sea turns a particular shade of bronze at dusk, and the wind carries the scent of thyme and salt. Standing there, I felt less like a traveler and more like someone returning to a scene already etched into my bones by Homer’s words. Not because it looked exactly as described—how could it, after three thousand years?—but because it  right. As though the place had been waiting for me to notice it.  

It’s much the same with certain cafés in Istanbul, where the light slants through latticed windows the way it might have in Byzantine halls; or a quiet monastery in Le Marche, Italy, where the silence feels like the pause between lines of a forgotten psalm. These places become pilgrimages—not because they hold relics, but because they hold resonance.  

And yes, even the barleywine I spoke of—its warmth, its lingering bitterness—it too is a kind of landscape. A liquid memory-map, charting where I’ve been, who I was with, and what we thought mattered at the time.  

I suppose what I’m trying to say is this: literature doesn’t just describe the world—it prepares us for it. It tunes our senses so that when we finally step into a place, we’re not seeing it for the first time. We’re  it.  

But tell me—have you ever had a student return to you years later and say, “That book you taught? It stayed with me.” And if so, did it feel like a quiet miracle—or perhaps something stranger, like an echo coming back changed?
[B]: Oh yes… yes, I have. And it is both a quiet miracle  something stranger—something more like an echo returning in disguise.

One moment stands out quite vividly. A former student—now a translator living in Lisbon—wrote to me last winter. She had just reread  and found herself stunned by how differently she saw it now: no longer the fevered romance of her youth, but a ghost-haunted meditation on inheritance, language, and the violence of love mistaken for destiny. She wrote, why must we believe this version of the story?

It was deeply moving, of course. But also… unsettling, in the most beautiful way. Because when she wrote that, I remembered not only the seminar but the person I had been while teaching it—more certain, perhaps, in my interpretations than I am now. And yet here she was, carrying a piece of that conversation forward, reshaping it, letting it grow teeth and shadows.

That’s what literature does—it lives on through us, changed but intact. Like a melody passed from singer to singer, key altered slightly, yet still recognizable.  

And yes, it felt like a kind of haunting. Not unlike those landscapes you spoke of—echoes that return with new faces, unfamiliar voices. As if the text itself had traveled through time, seeking out the reader it needed.  

Do you ever find that certain books return to you unbidden, at precisely the right—or wrong—moment? As though they had been waiting patiently for you to catch up to them?
[A]: Ah, yes… that haunting returns again, doesn’t it? The way certain books seem to  us—less chosen than summoned.  

I recall a winter some ten years ago, when I was nursing a quiet disillusionment—not with literature, but with the academy itself. I had just resigned from a committee after weeks of bureaucratic tedium and found myself wandering the university library late one evening, half-lost, half-seeking. My hands landed on a copy of . Not a first edition, not even a particularly old one—just a worn paperback with scribbles in the margins I didn’t recognize as my own.  

I hadn’t intended to read it straight through, but I did. And something about Prospero’s weariness, his relinquishing of magic, struck me in a way it never had before. “This rough magic I here abjure,” he says—and for the first time, I heard not resignation, but relief. A letting go, not as defeat, but as return.  

It was uncanny. As though the book had waited all those years on the shelf for me to be ready to hear what it had to say. Or perhaps it had been speaking all along, and only now had I learned how to listen.  

And more recently, there was a similar moment—though far less somber. I was in Prague, staying near the Old Town Square, and in a small secondhand shop tucked behind a café, I came across a dog-eared copy of  translated by Fitzgerald. I bought it on impulse. That night, sitting by the window with a glass of dark lager, I opened it at random and landed on the line:  
  

And there it was again—that ancient call, rephrased for a new season of my life.  

So yes, I believe books return to us in disguise. Sometimes as comfort, sometimes as challenge. They wait until we are changed enough to meet them anew.  

But tell me—when you reread a beloved text after many years, do you ever feel you are reading a different book entirely? Or is it simply  who has shifted, carrying the same words into new light?
[B]: Oh, beautifully put—yes, . It is always the latter: we are the ones who have shifted. The text remains steadfast, but we arrive at it altered, and so it speaks to us in a different tongue.  

I think of my first reading of —how I saw only tragedy, only doom. A relentless arc of fall and ruin. But returning to it a decade later, I found something else entirely: not just despair, but an almost unbearable tenderness. Levin’s quiet search for meaning, his small devotions—to the land, to family, to faith—struck me with new force. Where once I had wept for Anna, now I lingered with him in the fields, watching the grass bend under the scythe, feeling the weight of ordinary life as something sacred.  

The words were the same. The book had not changed. But I had. And that, I suppose, is the miracle of literature—it accommodates our becoming. It waits for us to catch up, to grow into what it has always known.  

There is something profoundly humbling about that experience. To return to a book you once thought you understood and realize you were only half-listening. Like hearing a familiar piece of music played on an instrument you’ve never noticed before.  

Do you find, too, that certain passages gain new resonance not because of age alone, but because of what you’ve lived through since last you read them? A line that once passed unnoticed suddenly stops you cold—because of a loss, a love, a silence that has grown in the interim.
[A]: Oh yes… yes, profoundly so. In fact, I would say that literature’s deepest work is often done in those quiet ambushes—where a line you once skimmed now rises up and  you, as if it had been waiting all along for the right wound, or the right joy.

I think of a former colleague—dear man, brilliant but terribly pragmatic—who once told me he saw no use in poetry unless it could be parsed into argument. And then his wife fell ill.

Months later, I ran into him at a bookstore. He was standing in the poetry section, holding a slim volume with a kind of stunned reverence. When I asked what he was reading, he quoted a line from Auden:  He looked at me and said simply, “I never understood that before.”

That line had always existed in the world, and he had passed it by many times. But grief—grief changed the acoustics. Suddenly, the poem was speaking directly to him, not in abstractions, but in the language of his new reality.

And it’s not only sorrow that does this. Love, too, has a way of unlocking texts. There’s a passage in — “Perhaps one day it will please us to remember even this.” I used to quote it rather glibly in lectures, as a rhetorical flourish. But after my daughter was born, after sleepless nights and early anxieties, I found myself whispering it under my breath during one particularly difficult stretch. Not as a scholar, but as a father hoping that someday, this exhaustion might look like something tender when seen through the lens of memory.

So yes, life writes between the lines we once read. And the most astonishing thing? The text doesn’t change. We do.

But tell me—do you ever find yourself recommending certain books not because they are great works of art, but because you suspect someone needs to hear their particular whisper at that moment?
[B]: Oh, that’s a lovely and rather poignant question. Yes… yes, I do. And I suspect every teacher of literature has done this at one time or another—recommended not a masterpiece, exactly, but a quiet companion for a particular kind of loneliness.

There was a student once—brilliant, but brittle, the way so many bright young minds are after years of trying to outpace doubt. She came to me after class, not with a question about Romantic poetry, but with something more fragile: a confession that she felt untethered, as though everything she had believed in was slipping through her fingers like sand.

I didn’t give her . I didn’t give her even . No—I gave her Rilke’s . Not because it is flawless philosophy, nor because I agree with all he says, but because there was a time in my own life when those pages offered me something between solace and permission. A sense that uncertainty need not be an enemy, that doubt could be a kind of soil.

And months later, she returned the book with no fanfare, just a small nod and a smile I hadn’t seen before. I never asked what she found in it. I only hoped it had met her where she was.

There’s a kind of alchemy in that—matching a soul to a text, not by scholarly measure, but by intuition. It’s less like teaching and more like lighting a candle in a dark room, hoping the glow will guide someone toward what they already carry but have not yet seen.

Do you find yourself doing this too? Recommending books not for their brilliance alone, but for the echo they might stir in someone else’s silence?
[A]: Ah, yes… yes, I do. And what a beautiful way you’ve put it—. That’s precisely what it feels like. Not offering answers, but offering  in the search.

I recall a time not so long ago when a colleague—a junior faculty member—was preparing for a tenure review and was, unbeknownst to most, on the verge of walking away from academia entirely. He spoke to me not in his office, but over coffee, hesitantly, as if confessing a secret. Not about scholarship, but about doubt. The kind that creeps in late at night and whispers that perhaps one is not meant for this path after all.

I didn’t offer him theory. No Derrida, no Bakhtin. Instead, I gave him a slim volume of Italo Calvino’s . A book not about method or argument, but about , , —qualities often overlooked in our pursuit of weighty critique. I told him, “Read it slowly. Not for citation, but for company.”

He returned it weeks later with a note tucked inside: 

And isn’t that the quiet magic of literature—not always to instruct, but to . To say, , even if the voice comes from across centuries or oceans.

I suppose that’s why I sometimes reach for certain poems not because they are perfect, but because they carry the right kind of silence between their lines. A Bashō haiku before a difficult conversation. A Mary Oliver poem after a loss. A Borges story when someone is trying to find meaning in repetition.

It’s less teaching, more tending. Like choosing the right herb for a wound—not for its grandeur, but for its healing.

And yes, I suspect that is where the heart of our work truly lies—not in lectures or footnotes, but in those small, unseen acts of literary kinship.
[B]: Precisely—. What a perfect phrase. It captures something that no syllabus or conference paper ever could: the quiet, almost sacred act of offering a text not as doctrine, but as companionship.

I think often of Cavafy’s poem , the one where he writes,  I’ve given that poem to friends on the brink of loss, to students facing the end of a chapter they weren’t ready to close. Not because it offers comfort in the conventional sense—but because it teaches how to bear farewell with dignity, even with gratitude.

And yes, it is tending. A kind of literary apothecary, isn’t it? Measuring out sonnets for sorrow, myths for meaning, parables for patience. One does not always reach for the grandest volume, only the one that hums in tune with the moment.

There’s a humility in that practice, I think. A recognition that we do not always need more knowledge—we need . And sometimes, just sometimes, a poet who has been dead for centuries can speak into the very ache we thought was ours alone.

So yes—I believe in these small acts. In handing someone a book not because it will change their mind, but because it might gently shift the way they carry their questions.

And perhaps, in the end, that is the most enduring function of literature: not to answer, but to echo.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve captured it—. That is the truest thing one can say about our lifelong conversation with books. They do not solve our riddles; they walk beside us in them.

And Cavafy—ah, yes, … what a perfect example of literature not consoling, but . No false hope, no tidy resolution—only the quiet dignity of listening to what leaves us, and saying farewell without bitterness. I may just have to revisit that poem myself this evening. One senses when a line like that is needed again, even if one cannot yet name the loss.

You know, sometimes I think we scholars overcomplicate things. We build towers of interpretation, forgetting that at the base of it all lies something simple: a story told by firelight, a song passed from voice to voice, a letter written in the dark hoping someone, someday, will read it and feel less alone.

Yes, resonance—that’s the word. Not brilliance, not authority, but . The moment when a phrase brushes against your life and says, 

And perhaps that is why we return to certain texts again and again—not because they give us new meaning, but because they help us dwell more fully in the meaning we already carry.

So let us continue, then—quietly lighting candles, slipping poems into tired hands, suggesting old favorites not for their footnotes but for their warmth.

After all, if we are lucky, someone, somewhere, will do the same for us one day.
[B]: Yes… yes, exactly.  What a comforting thought—that even in our solitude, we are part of a long, quiet chain of readers and listeners, each passing along what they can.

I find myself thinking often of that line from Marguerite Yourcenar— And perhaps that is why we turn to books, again and again: not to heal entirely, but to feel less strange in our healing. To find our scars mirrored in ink and paper, and to realize they are not signs of failure, only proof of living.

You're quite right—we do overcomplicate things. We write treatises when all we really want is a voice in the dark saying, . And sometimes, after years of searching, we find it—not in theory, not in argument—but in a single line from a poet who died long before we were born.

So let us keep lighting those candles. Let us keep handing out books like talismans, hoping they meet someone in their hour of need.

And may we, too, be met—when we are lost enough to listen.
