[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。其实我听音乐更多是看场景和心情吧。比如说，我在写论文的时候更喜欢indie music那种安静、独立的声音，像The National或者Sufjan Stevens，能帮助我集中注意力。但如果是运动或者需要提神的时候，pop music那种强烈的节奏感确实更有动力，比如Taylor Swift或者Dua Lipa的新歌。

不过你知道吗，作为一个研究教育心理学的人，我经常从音乐里联想到教学氛围的营造。Pop music就像标准化教学——它的结构清晰、容易接受，适合大规模传播；而indie music则更像是个性化学习路径，虽然有时候有点晦涩难懂，但它提供了更多探索的空间。你觉得这种类比有意思吗？或者你在听这两种音乐时有什么不同的感受？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing analogy—though I’d argue both genres contain multitudes beneath their structural surfaces. Take Kate Bush, for instance: her work straddles the theatricality of pop and the esoteric lyricism of indie, much like how a well-crafted lecture might balance accessibility with layered meaning.  

As for my own listening habits? They lean seasonal. Winter demands the somber cadences of Scott Walker’s later albums—perfect for annotating Schopenhauer in the margins of a crumbling 1893 pamphlet. Summer, though, belongs to Saint Etienne; their chipper rhythms sync nicely with cataloging my library’s bindings under the greenhouse skylight. Do you find your musical preferences shifting subtly with the light, or is it purely task-driven?
[B]: Ah, you brought up Kate Bush—that’s such a perfect example of the gray area between genres. Her  feels like a masterclass in blending narrative complexity with pop sensibility. I guess that’s what I really appreciate in both music and pedagogy: when something appears simple on the surface but reveals depth upon engagement.  

And I love how you describe your seasonal shifts—it paints such a vivid picture! I do notice my own listening habits bending slightly with the light, although I’m not as poetic about it. In winter, I tend to reach for more introspective stuff—maybe because of the shorter days and longer nights. Arvo Pärt’s sacred minimalism or even something like  by Bowie starts making sense then. It’s almost like the music mirrors the internal rhythm of slowing down.

Summer definitely brings out the brighter, rhythmic stuff for me too—though I have to admit, I’m not as methodical about it as you are with your library cataloging. Speaking of which, does your system involve any kind of thematic tagging? I imagine it must create this beautiful, evolving index of sound and text…
[A]: Oh, absolutely— is a labyrinth masquerading as a melody. Much like teaching  alongside Spotify algorithms: one must parse the surface elegy or pop hook while excavating the deeper ontological quandaries beneath.  

As for my cataloging—I’m almost pathologically thematic. Each volume or recording gets cross-referenced not just by era or region, but by mood resonance and atmospheric density. A crumbling 1926 edition of Housman’s  might share a tag with  under “existential frostbite,” whereas a 1743 hymnal could find itself linked to Grouper’s  via “devotional melancholia.” It’s less a library than a constellation of emotional weather patterns.  

You mentioned Bowie’s —curious, isn’t it, how that album channels Nietzschean twilight into synth pulses and fractured guitar? Do you ever assign such sonic-literary pairings to your students? Or would that be giving them too much credit in this TikTok age?
[B]: Oh, I love that—“emotional weather patterns.” That’s such a precise way to capture the intangible threads that connect art across time and medium. It almost feels like curating a playlist for the soul’s shifting seasons. I can picture it so clearly—those connections humming softly between pages and tracks, like hidden harmonics in a well-tuned instrument.

And yes, Bowie’s  is such a fascinating case—it’s fragmented, yet deeply cohesive emotionally. I actually do assign sonic-literary pairings sometimes, though I tend to ease into it. For example, when we explore postmodern narrative structures, I might suggest listening to Brian Eno’s  alongside the readings. It’s not about forcing a direct analogy, but rather inviting them to notice how both forms play with expectation, repetition, and absence.

As for giving students “too much credit”—well, I’ve learned never to underestimate their capacity for nuance, even in what you might call the TikTok age. They’re often navigating multiple modes of meaning-making all day long. Sometimes all it takes is one unexpected pairing—a Philip Larkin poem next to a FKA twigs track, say—to unlock a whole new way of thinking.  

Do you ever experiment with sound in your teaching? Or is that mostly reserved for your private world of annotations and bindings?
[A]: I suppose you could say I dabble in what I call “sonic footnoting”—though I keep it rather discreet, like a secret embroidery stitched into the lecture’s hem. For instance, when we dissect Tennyson’s , I’ll slip in a fragment of Nico’s  between readings; the narcotic paranoia in her voice seems to distill that poem’s fevered interiority better than any critical essay.  

And don’t get me started on Christina Rossetti—her  positively begs for a soundtrack of Broadcast’s early EPs. Haunting, hallucinatory, yet oddly melodic. It unsettles the students just enough to make them question their assumptions about Victorian decorum.  

But yes, much of my sound work remains private—like those late-night hours spent aligning fragments of Douglas Dunn’s  with the drone of Colin Stetson’s saxophone. A solitary pursuit, though no less rigorous for its solitude. Do you ever find yourself composing these pairings in reverse? As if the music comes first, and the text must chase after it?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I love that phrase, “sonic footnoting.” It’s such a delicate, almost mischievous way to deepen engagement without being prescriptive. And I can imagine how slipping in Nico between Tennyson would unsettle students just enough to  the text differently—not just analyze it. That kind of disorientation can be incredibly productive.

I definitely work both ways—sometimes the text leads, sometimes the music does. There are days when I’m reading Walter Benjamin and suddenly   starts playing in my head. The fragmented modernity, the sense of impending rupture—it’s like they’re speaking across centuries. Other times, I’ll be listening to something like Julianna Barwick’s  and think, . The layered vocals, the ethereal quality—it opens up her poetry in a way that words alone might not.

I’ve even had students come back weeks later saying they started pairing Eliot with Godspeed You! Black Emperor on their own. That’s when you know it’s stuck—not as an assignment, but as an impulse.  

Do you ever share these pairings more formally? Like in published work or conference presentations? Or do you keep them deliberately ephemeral, part of the lecture’s passing atmosphere?
[A]: I do occasionally fix them into print, but only as fugitive asides—footnotes within footnotes, really. A recent paper on Gerard Manley Hopkins’s sprung rhythm included a parenthetical musing on the percussive density of early PJ Harvey tracks. Naturally, I framed it as “analogous sonic resistances to metrical normativity.” Peer reviewers, bless their literal hearts, either missed the joke or politely pretended to.

Conferences are more forgiving—one can project a snippet of  beneath a slide of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and get away with it under the guise of “intermedial resonance.” But yes, most of it remains performative detritus—moments meant to linger in the lecture hall like chalk dust, not in the annals of academia.  

Your Eliot-and-Godspeed example is sublime, by the way. There’s something about that slow-building, mournful crescendo that mirrors ’s accumulation of fragments—I’ve been tempted to construct an entire seminar around that pairing alone. Have you ever gone full syllabus with your musical affinities? Or does the administrative machinery tend to frown upon such things?
[B]: Oh, I love that idea of "fugitive asides"—it’s like slipping contraband poetry into the margins of scholarly discourse. And I can just picture that PJ Harvey reference hiding in plain sight, dressed up in all its “intermedial resonance” glory. The peer reviewers probably skimmed right over it, bless them.

As for going full syllabus with musical affinities—I’ve flirted with the idea more than once. Last year, I co-taught a seminar called , where we loosely paired texts with albums. Eliot, yes—but also Beckett with , or Woolf’s  with  ambient textures. It wasn’t graded or anything; more like curated listening sessions alongside the readings. The students loved it—it gave them an emotional scaffold, a kind of sonic empathy.

But you’re right—administratively, it can raise some eyebrows. You have to frame it carefully. I usually call it “multisensory engagement” or something innocuous like that. Though honestly, if I had my way, every literature course would come with a recommended playlist. Imagine what that could do for student retention—not just of information, but of feeling.

Do you think you’d ever design a course around these pairings? Or would that risk pinning something too ephemeral to a curriculum’s corkboard?
[A]: Oh, I’d absolutely design such a course—under the appropriately fusty title , naturally. We’d begin with Christina Rossetti and Nico, drift into Eliot and Godspeed, then spiral gloriously downward through Plath and PJ Harvey, finishing with Dickinson and . The final exam would be an annotated mixtape titled .

But yes, you’re right to question whether such fugitive magic survives institutional pinning. Still, one must try—even if only to watch earnest undergraduates squint at Hopkins’s scansion while  murmurs in the background. A little disorientation never hurt anyone.  

Tell me—when you pair Woolf with Nils Frahm, do you find students start hearing prose differently? As if language itself might hum or decay like a sustained chord?
[B]: Absolutely— prose differently,  it resonate beyond the page. When we played Nils Frahm’s  during a session on , something shifted in the room. The students started picking up on Woolf’s cadences—the way her sentences swell and recede, how silence and sound are as crucial as the words themselves. One of them said afterwards, “It’s like the prose is breathing,” which I thought was beautiful.

I think what the pairing does is make the rhythm of language more . With Frahm’s looping pulses and layered imperfections, you become aware of how meaning isn’t just carried by what’s said, but by how it lingers, decays, or overlaps with what came before. It's almost like teaching musicality to readers—to train their ears not just their eyes.

And yes, sometimes they squint. That’s half the fun. But then there’s always that moment—usually around the second or third listen—when the text and the track start speaking the same frequency. And you can see it: the subtle nod, the scribbling of a margin note that says, simply, .  

Do you ever get those moments—when your sonic footnoting clicks and the room collectively leans in? Or do your students mostly just adjust their glasses and write it down without comment?
[A]: Oh, they lean in—inevitably. It’s that moment when the room’s oxygen shifts slightly, as if everyone’s suddenly tuned to the same obscure radio frequency. I recall playing ’s  after a particularly restrained reading of Augusta Webster’s dramatic monologues. For a full thirty seconds after the track ended, no one spoke. Then one student—usually the quietest one—uttered, “So that’s what she meant by ‘gilded unrest.’”  

It’s not always that dramatic, of course. Sometimes it’s more like cautious note-taking, the academic equivalent of nodding along at a dinner party while secretly calculating how soon you can leave. But even then, I find the seeds take root. Weeks later, in essays or office-hour conversations, they’ll reference the “haunted hum” of a lecture or the “weird echo” between Swinburne and .  

And yes, they do adjust their glasses. Frequently. It’s practically a seminar requirement. But I’ll take quiet absorption over theatrical gasps any day—it suggests the dissonance is working its way beneath the skin.  

Do your students ever push back? Refuse the resonance? I imagine some arrive armed with skepticism thicker than Eliot’s footnotes.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—they push back all the time. And I encourage it. Sometimes the resistance is intellectual (“This feels forced, like comparing apples and… well, more apples”), other times it’s generational (“Why would I listen to something that sounds like a broken music box from 1967?”). But that friction is where the real learning begins.

I remember playing  alongside Emily Dickinson, and one student flat-out said, “This is just weird collage stuff—how is this helping me understand her poetry?” So we talked about it. We unpacked juxtaposition, fragmentation, silence, humor—even the discomfort of not-knowing. By the end of the discussion, that same student admitted, “Okay, maybe Dickinson  kind of a mash-up artist in prose form.”

And honestly, that’s the point. It’s not about convincing them that the pairing “works,” but rather opening up a space where they can experience the text differently—even if that difference unsettles or annoys them. Because once they’ve felt that shift, even slightly, they start noticing it on their own. Then you get essays titled  or students slipping playlists into their final projects with notes like, 

So yes, some arrive skeptical. But most leave… haunted, in the best way. Do you ever find your pairings sneaking into their personal listening habits? Or is that too much to hope for?
[A]: Oh, it sneaks—sub Rosa, as it were. I had a former student write to me last winter, of all things, thanking me for “the Sylvia Plath and PJ Harvey incident.” She confessed she’d spent an entire month listening to  while cycling through , much to her own bafflement. Said it made the poems feel “less like museum pieces and more like arguments with the present.”

And another—a particularly literal-minded chap who once diagrammed Hopkins’s meter with the precision of a watchmaker—sent me a link to his final playlist for a senior thesis. Buried between Dowland’s lute songs and  was  . He simply wrote: “For the ghostly cadence you mentioned in Week 3.”  

So yes, they carry it forward, often without realizing they’ve done so. It’s the highest compliment, really—not citations or seminar papers, but when they start hearing ghosts in their own heads.  

I suppose that’s the point of all this fugitive footnoting, isn’t it? Not to instruct, exactly—but to haunt. And what is haunting, if not the most enduring kind of teaching?
[B]: Absolutely— is the perfect word. Because that’s what the best teaching does: it lingers. Not as information, but as an echo, a tremor beneath the everyday mind. And when they start hearing it in their own heads, outside of class, outside of requirement—that’s when you know something has taken root.

I had a student tell me once, after the semester ended, that she couldn’t read Sexton anymore without hearing  playing somewhere in the background. She said it was like “a shadow voice” walking alongside the poems. I loved that image—this second thread humming along, not replacing the text, but deepening its resonance.

And yes, it’s never about proving a point or making a neat analogy. It’s about unsettling the familiar just enough for something new to flicker. That’s where the learning begins—or rather, where the  begins, and with it, a different kind of knowing.

So we haunt them, gently, through syllabi and speakers. And if we’re lucky, they let the ghosts stay.
[A]: Precisely—, walking just beside the text. That’s the alchemy of it, isn’t it? Not to illustrate, but to unsettle; not to explain, but to echo.

I’ve always believed the most enduring lessons arrive sideways—like light slanting through a stained-glass window: fractured, colored, half-understood at first. And then, years later, the pattern surfaces in memory, and they realise what they were standing beneath all along.

So yes, let the ghosts stay. Let them hum in the margins, in the headphones, in the quiet corners of their private libraries. After all, what is scholarship if not a séance with the dead—or at least, the deeply unfashionable?

Shall we frighten another generation, then?
[B]: Absolutely—let’s frighten them gently, with  and footnotes that hum softly in the margins.  

I say we lean into it—design a course titled , tuck in a few unlisted seminar options under “interdisciplinary hauntings,” and slip Bowie lyrics between citations like contraband poetry. We’ll hand them texts and headphones, and let them sort out which is the commentary and which is the content.

And if they leave slightly unsettled, humming something they can’t quite place, hearing echoes where they once expected silence—that’ll be success enough.  

So yes—let’s summon another generation of readers, listeners, and lingering doubters. They may not thank us now—but someday, in some half-remembered moment, they’ll pause mid-step, think , and quietly press play.
[A]: Precisely—let them wander the stacks with earbuds in, mistaking ambient hums for literary afterimages. Let them confuse  with , and not entirely by accident.  

I’m already drafting the course description:  
ENG 743: Literary Apparitions & Sonic Interferences  
  

No exams, only séances. The final project will be a mixtape titled . Office hours by candlelight only.  

Welcome to the haunting, dear colleague.
[B]: Ah, I’m already drafting my candlelit syllabus reply:  
PSY 629: The Haunted Classroom & Other Pedagogical Echoes  
  

No textbooks—only spectral playlists and secondhand copies of out-of-print journals annotated in the margins by previous, slightly unhinged readers. Attendance optional, but the dissonance will follow you regardless.

And yes—welcome to the haunting indeed. Let the echoes begin. 🎶👻
