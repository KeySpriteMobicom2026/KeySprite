[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, DIY projects...这个话题让我想起前些日子在读加德纳的《艺术即经验》，里面提到的手工制作对人的认知发展颇有启发。虽说平时多是侍弄花草，但偶尔也会做一些简单的木工。上周末试着用紫檀木做了个笔架，虽然粗糙了些，但看着它从一块毛料渐渐成形，倒也颇有趣味。你呢？有做过什么有意思的DIY项目吗？
[A]: Hmm，你提到加德纳，让我想到他多元智能理论里的，确实和DIY这种动手实践联系紧密。紫檀木做笔架听起来已经很精致了！我自己最近在尝试一个有点challenging的project——用回收材料做一个书架。灵感其实来自我教跨文化心理学时的一个观察：不同文化中，人们对于“家”的象征物往往跟手工制作有关，比如北欧的木质家具、日本的手工漆器。我想把这些元素mix一下，做成一个有点fusion风格的作品。不过cutting那块木头的时候差点划到手，下次得记得带手套😅。话说回来，你的木工过程有遇到什么tricky的地方吗？
[B]: Interesting observation about bodily-kinesthetic intelligence — indeed, the tactile engagement in DIY connects deeply with that. My woodworking process was tricky mostly because of the wood’s natural tendency to split — especially with紫檀木’s dense grain. I had to研究一下 traditional Chinese carpentry techniques, like the use of wooden dowels instead of metal nails to allow for expansion & contraction.  

Your fusion-style bookshelf sounds fascinating! The cross-cultural angle adds depth to the project — almost like a material对话ue between Nordic minimalism and Japanese craftsmanship. As for cutting safety, you’re absolutely right — I learned that the hard way too. Maybe we could even say: a cut finger is the price of haste, much like how in literature, a rushed interpretation往往leads to误读.  

How are you joining the recycled materials?传统榫卯或许可以提供一些灵感，尤其是考虑到文化象征的意义。
[A]: Ah, wooden dowels — brilliant choice! It’s amazing how传统techniques can solve modern problems, like a timeless lesson in patience and material respect. I’m using mostly reclaimed pine wood for my bookshelf, joined with a mix of metal brackets  some simple mortise-and-tenon joints I managed to figure out after watching a few YouTube tutorials 🎥. Not quite the full traditional 榫卯 system, but I’m trying to incorporate its spirit — especially the idea of interlocking pieces without relying on external fasteners. It’s funny you mention haste and误读, because every time I rush a cut or skip a measurement, I end up with a误差 that makes me rethink the whole design.  

I’ve also embedded some small ceramic tiles I made myself — inspired by Japanese , where broken pottery is repaired with gold. So instead of hiding flaws, I’m highlighting them as part of the shelf’s “story.” Definitely adds a narrative dimension to the object, wouldn’t you say? 📖✨
[B]: Absolutely — your approach is like a material embodiment of what Gadamer called , where the object carries within it layers of cultural memory and personal narrative. The use of 榫卯’s spirit, even if not strictly traditional, echoes the Confucian idea of  (ritual) — form as a vessel for meaning, not just function.  

And kintsugi! What a poetic gesture. It reminds me of how in , Murasaki Shikibu deliberately leaves certain ambiguities unresolved — imperfections that invite interpretation, much like your ceramic inlays. Those gold-repaired cracks become visual annotations, guiding the viewer’s hermeneutic gaze.  

As for误差 — yes, they’re like textual lacunae. You try to fill them, but sometimes they force you to read the whole design anew. I had a similar moment when carving the笔架 groove — one slip, and the curvature became more  than , almost like a calligraphic stroke that implies rather than defines.  

I’d love to see a photo once it’s done — assuming you don’t mind sharing. I might even bring it up in my next lecture on East-West aesthetics — with credit, of course. 😊
[A]: That would be wonderful — I’ll definitely snap some photos once it’s finished. Your comparison to  and  is spot on. It really does tie back to how objects aren’t just functional — they’re carriers of intention, history, and dialogue. I love how you connected the误差 to textual lacunae; in a way, every mistake becomes an invitation for reinterpretation, almost like a reader-response theory applied to woodworking 🤔📚.  

And your笔架 groove story is a perfect metaphor — that shift from precision to suggestion, from rigid form to open meaning… sounds a lot like hermeneutics, doesn’t it? Maybe we should start calling DIY “material exegesis” 😄.  

By the way, I’d be curious to hear what examples you use in your lecture on East-West aesthetics — any particular texts or artifacts that consistently spark good discussion?
[B]: Ah, what a delightful phrase — . I may just borrow that in my next seminar. 😊  

As for examples in my lectures, I often begin with a juxtaposition of two texts: Zhuangzi’s tale of the匠石 carving wood with effortless skill, and Heidegger’s  — the fourfold of earth, sky, divinities, and mortals — to explore how both Eastern and Western traditions conceive of craft as a form of dwelling. Students usually find the parallel between  and  fascinating, though not without its interpretive challenges.  

Another favorite is comparing Persian miniature paintings with Renaissance perspective art. The former emphasizes symbolic arrangement over spatial realism, much like how your bookshelf prioritizes narrative over structural uniformity. That always sparks a lively discussion about what counts as “accuracy” in representation.  

And of course, no East-West lecture is complete without reference to Ezra Pound’s mistranslations of Chinese poetry — a perfect case study in how误读 can sometimes create new aesthetic价值值. In a way, it’s not so different from your DIY project: an act of recombination, where meaning emerges through friction and fusion.  

I’d say your bookshelf would fit right in — both as an object lesson and a metaphor. 📜🪵
[A]: Ah, Zhuangzi and Heidegger in the same breath — that’s high-level conceptual weaving! I can imagine the look on students’ faces when you drop that匠石 meets  bombshell 😄. I mean, both traditions pointing to a kind of harmony between maker and material — it really does echo your point about craft as dwelling.  

And Ezra Pound’s “creative mistranslations” — now  a phrase worth unpacking over coffee 📚☕️. It makes me wonder: do you push the analogy further with DIY? Like, is every handmade object a kind of translation — from idea to form, from culture to context? Especially when there's a bit of cultural borrowing involved, like my half-Scandinavian, half-Wabi-Sabi shelf.  

I’d love to hear more about how students respond to those comparisons. Do they tend to lean into the philosophical parallels, or do they get stuck on the differences? And have you ever had someone try to make their own metaphorical “translation” through a hands-on project? Maybe something like embodied learning?
[B]: Ah, an excellent line of inquiry — and yes, I do often see students’ eyes widen when we go from Zhuangzi’s匠石 to Heidegger in a single lecture! But once the initial surprise passes, many begin to grasp that both traditions are, in their own way, articulating a kind of  — whether through the flow of  or the grounding of . Some find it abstract at first, but when we connect it to tangible examples — like a well-crafted object or even a carefully brewed cup of tea — the ideas gain texture.

As for your question about handmade objects as translation — I’d say that’s not only poetic but also philosophically rich. Each DIY project is indeed a process of , if you will — translating intention into matter, thought into form, and yes, culture into context. Your shelf, with its Nordic-Wabi-Sabi hybridity, is a perfect case: a material dialectic between minimalism and imperfection, utility and beauty, silence and story.

I’ve had students who tried to make such metaphorical translations before — one created a mixed-media scroll painting using digital prints of classical Chinese landscapes, overlaid with ink-brushed annotations inspired by Roland Barthes. Another built a small wooden chest with compartments labeled in Mandarin and French, each holding objects that “translated” concepts like memory, identity, and loss across cultures. It was quite moving — a literal  symbolic vessel of cross-cultural reflection.

So yes, embodied learning — where the hand shapes the mind even as the mind guides the hand — is very much part of what I try to encourage. After all, as Dewey reminds us, art and experience are not separate realms; they are continuous. And perhaps the same can be said for craft and understanding. 📖🪵✨
[A]: Wow — that student chest sounds like a miniature  of cultural memory. I can almost imagine opening each drawer and stepping into a different emotional landscape — quite literally holding跨文化in your hands. It’s fascinating how tactile engagement deepens the cognitive resonance; you’re not just analyzing concepts, you’re constructing them through material choices, textures, even the resistance of the wood against the chisel.

That connection to Dewey is spot on — his idea of aesthetic experience as continuous with everyday life really bridges the gap between making and knowing. I find myself thinking of the  quote: “A narrative is an act of reconstruction, not replication.” And isn’t that what we’re doing in both craft and cross-cultural interpretation? Reconstructing meaning through embodied action?

I wonder — have you ever had a student take this kind of embodied learning beyond the classroom? Like, into their daily lives or communities? I’m curious if the tactile-aesthetic mode has a ripple effect beyond academic reflection — maybe into something more civic or relational.
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive question — and yes, I’ve seen that ripple effect more than once. In fact, one former student, after taking my course on East-West aesthetics, started a small community project called  — it began as a workshop series where participants, mostly young adults from diverse backgrounds, would collaboratively craft objects using traditional techniques from their own cultures. The idea was simple yet profound: to use making as a way to explore identity, memory, and shared space.

One session focused on the Japanese concept of  — the inseparability of form and function — while another drew from Islamic geometric pattern-making as a meditative practice. But the magic happened not just in the crafting itself, but in the conversations that emerged — around tools, materials, even silences. It became a kind of tactile dialogue, where cultural boundaries softened through shared labor.

I think you're absolutely right to connect this with Genette’s idea of narrative as reconstruction — because every handmade object tells a story, one shaped by intention, interrupted by material resistance, and ultimately reinterpreted by those who encounter it. And when that object is made in community, it becomes a site of relational meaning — not unlike what Nussbaum calls  in literature, but grounded in wood, clay, and thread.

So yes, embodied learning doesn’t stop at the classroom door — if we’re lucky, it spills into daily life like ink from a brushstroke, quietly reshaping how we see, touch, and dwell with others. 🪵📖🤝
[A]: That’s beautiful —  sounds like a living, breathing example of what we might call . I love how it brings together the tactile and the narrative, not just as a way of knowing, but as a way of  with others. It makes me think of how Hannah Arendt describes action as something that reveals who we are — not through speech alone, but through deeds that leave a trace in the world. In a way, these crafted objects become such traces — quiet yet enduring acts of presence and connection.

I can imagine the conversations emerging not just from what was said, but from how a hand moved across paper, or how a piece of wood resisted the grain. There's something deeply human in that — a kind of vulnerability that comes through making, especially when you're working with traditions that carry personal or ancestral meaning.

It also reminds me of your earlier point about误读 — because in collaborative making, there’s always the possibility of misinterpretation, yet those moments can open up new creative pathways. Like a knot in the wood that forces you to change direction — frustrating at first, but ultimately generative.  

I wonder if you’ve thought about documenting some of these projects — not as static artifacts, but as evolving narratives? Maybe even incorporating digital storytelling or soundscapes to capture the rhythm of creation? I’d be curious to see how the material voice translates into other media. 🎧🪵📖
[B]: What a rich and thoughtful vision — I can already hear the soft rasp of chisels, the murmur of voices around a worktable, even the creak of wood settling into new form… Yes,  — that’s exactly it. It’s not just about understanding another’s perspective, but about feeling with them through the medium of matter itself. A kind of intersubjectivity grounded in touch, tension, and time.

You’re right to bring in Arendt — her notion of action as revelation fits perfectly here. When someone carves, stitches, or folds a material into shape, they are, in a sense, disclosing themselves to the world. Not through declarations, but through gesture, patience, perhaps even hesitation. And those traces — a hesitant brushstroke, a mended joint, a knot worked into the design — become testimonies of presence, much like the marginalia in an old manuscript.

As for documenting these projects — it’s something I’ve been contemplating, especially after seeing how ephemeral many of these creations are. One student, inspired by the idea of , deliberately left her woven basket unfinished, saying that “completeness would freeze its story.” How do you document something that resists finality?

Your suggestion of digital storytelling or soundscapes is intriguing. I can imagine audio recordings layered with narration — the grain of a voice echoing the grain of the wood, so to speak. Or a visual montage where hands move across materials while subtitles trace evolving thoughts: 

Perhaps even a podcast series —  — where each episode centers on a particular object and the stories it carries. We could include ambient workshop sounds, interviews, even poetic reflections. It would be a way to translate haptic memory into auditory narrative — a different sensory register, but still deeply rooted in the act of making.

I’d love your input on such a project — especially your ear for rhythm and resonance. After all, you seem to listen to objects as one might listen to a poem — attentive not just to what they say, but to how they breathe. 🎧📖🪵✨
[A]: Hmm,  — I love how it carries both weight and whisper. It makes me think of how Walter Benjamin wrote about the storyteller as someone who carries history in their voice, passing it on not through analysis but through presence. In a way, your podcast idea could do just that: let objects speak through the people who shaped them, and the materials that resisted or yielded.

I can already imagine the soundscape of a workshop — the rhythmic tapping of a mallet, the uneven rasp of sandpaper, maybe even the occasional sigh or chuckle. These aren’t background noises; they’re the syntax of making. And when layered with reflection — like  — they become something like a poetic meter, grounding thought in motion.  

Your idea of subtitles tracing inner experience is brilliant too — almost like a visual  to the audio. It reminds me of how some classical Chinese paintings include calligraphy right on the canvas — commentary woven into the image itself. A kind of multimodal brushwork.  

As for the name, maybe we could play with a slight variation — ? It nods to both material texture and narrative depth. Either way, I’d be honored to contribute — whether through sound design, writing, or just being a critical listener. After all, someone once told me that teaching, like craftsmanship, is best done in dialogue — and this feels like a very beautiful one beginning. 🎙️🪵📖✨
[B]: … Ah, that has a quiet resonance to it — subtle, textured, and just a little haunting. I can almost hear the title spoken softly at the beginning of an episode, followed by the sound of a hand brushing along the length of a wooden board — not smooth, but gently resisting, as if the grain itself were whispering back.

You're quite right about the soundscape — those rhythmic gestures of making are more than ambient noise; they’re a kind of embodied syntax, a grammar of effort and intention. The tap of a mallet isn’t just a tap — it’s punctuation. A pause for thought. A comma before a shift in direction. And when someone laughs or sighs while sanding a rough edge, that’s a footnote, perhaps even a revelation.

I’d love to explore the calligraphic parallel too — integrating text not as caption but as commentary, floating over footage of hands at work. Maybe even using brush-and-ink animations to echo the motion of carving or stitching. It would be a way to bring the visual into dialogue with the auditory, much like how Zhuangzi uses parable and metaphor to accompany action.

And your idea of  means more than you know — because like any craft, this kind of project thrives on dialogue. Not the kind that fills silence, but the kind that deepens it. Like two people working side by side, speaking only when necessary, yet always attuned to the rhythm of the other’s hand.

So yes, let’s begin this conversation — slowly, carefully, and with attention to the grain. 🎙️🪵📖✨
[A]: I’m already imagining the first episode — maybe we start not with a grand statement, but with a gesture. A hand selecting a piece of wood, turning it in the light, considering its possibilities and limits. Just a few quiet moments of that, accompanied by soft ambient sound — the hum of a workshop, the occasional creak of floorboards — before any voice enters.

And then, perhaps a simple question:  Not in a romantic sense, but in a phenomenological one — how does it resist, yield, or surprise? That, to me, is where the dialogue begins: between maker and matter, past and present, intention and accident.

I’d be happy to help shape those early recordings — maybe even bring in a portable mic to capture some real woodwork sessions. There’s something about analog texture that digital can’t quite replicate; like the difference between reading a poem and hearing it spoken, breath behind the words.

As for the calligraphic layer — I wonder if we could animate brushstrokes in post-production, syncing them with the rhythm of carving or stitching. A visual echo of the hand’s movement, appearing just as a maker hesitates or adjusts their grip. Almost like an inner thought made visible.

Yes, let’s begin — slowly, as you said, with attention to grain, silence, and the spaces between gestures. I think Zhuangzi would approve. Or at least smile quietly, as匠石 might, before making his cut. 🎙️🪵🖋️📖✨
[B]: Precisely — , not the explanation. Let the hand move first, let the wood speak through its grain before any word is uttered. That silence — filled only with the subtle friction of fingers against timber — would be the most eloquent overture.

I can already see it: slow light across a workbench, dust suspended in air, time thickened. Then, the question —  — not as an intellectual puzzle, but as a maker’s prayer. A humble listening.

That’s where  should begin, because it places us — both listener and maker — in the space of becoming. No theory upfront, no framework — just the body, the material, and the quiet negotiation between them. Everything else follows from there: the cultural echoes, the philosophical parallels, even the laughter after a mistake.

Your idea of capturing real woodwork sessions is essential. There's irreplaceable depth in analog sound — the irregular rasp of a hand plane, the slight hesitation in a stroke, the breath behind effort. It’s the difference you say between reading and reciting — and I do believe Zhuangzi would nod at that analogy, perhaps with a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

And yes, the animated brushstrokes — syncing them with moments of decision or doubt adds a visual introspection, like a silent commentary emerging from the material itself. A kind of calligraphic consciousness, echoing the maker’s intent — or resistance to intent.

So, shall we consider this the first draft of our pilot episode? I’ll begin drafting a rough outline — no rush, of course — and we can shape it further as the material suggests. After all, every good craft begins with a single, attentive gesture. 🎙️🪵🖋️📖✨
[A]: Absolutely — let’s call this the  of our pilot. I love the idea of resisting theory at the outset; better to begin with the body, the bench, the grain — and let reflection emerge from there, like wood shavings curling away from the blade.

I’ll start gathering some field recordings soon — maybe even test a short clip of me planing a piece of walnut while talking through that initial question:  Just enough to capture texture, breath, and motion without overthinking it. We can always refine later.

As for the outline, I’m all ears — or rather, all hands — to see where the material leads you. And yes, Zhuangzi would definitely approve of beginning slowly, attentively, with empty hands ready to be filled.

Looking forward to seeing how this takes shape — no pun intended 😄. Let’s keep listening, carefully, to what wants to be made. 🎙️🪵🖋️📖✨
[B]: Wonderful —  it is. No over-polishing, no grand prologue, just the quiet hum of making. Let’s keep our hands loose and our ears open.

I’ll begin drafting the outline with that same spirit — not a rigid script, but more like a sketch in charcoal, smudged at the edges, leaving room for the material to guide us. Perhaps we can build each episode around a central gesture or moment of decision — like that first turning of the wood in the hand — and let the reflections grow from there, like rings forming slowly around a lived experience.

Looking forward to hearing your field recordings — the sound of planing walnut, the rhythm of breath behind effort, the subtle resistance of grain. There’s something deeply intimate about that — almost like listening to thought before it becomes language.

And Zhuangzi would indeed approve. I imagine him standing quietly by the bench, watching the shavings curl away, saying nothing — only nodding once, as the blade moves true.

So yes, let’s proceed — gently, attentively, and always with an ear for what the material wants to say. 🎙️🪵🖋️📖✨
