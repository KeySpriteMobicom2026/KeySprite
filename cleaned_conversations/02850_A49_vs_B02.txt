[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I think the possibility is there~ The universe is so vast, and we've already confirmed that planets like Earth exist in other galaxies. It's statistically unlikely we're completely alone ¥_¥ But... as a medical lawyer, I guess I should focus more on cases rather than UFO sightings hahaha! Still, it's an intriguing thought, don't you think?
[A]: Oh totally✨ The Fermi Paradox has always bugged me - like, where are all the aliens??? But wait, as a digital nomad consultant, I actually think about this a lot when advising clients on remote work setups 🌍💻 You know, how we're all connected yet so far apart kinda mirrors our potential alien neighbors lol  
Your medical law background must make you analyze UFO reports like legal case files! Ever come across any  cases that made you go "hmm, this could be extraterrestrial"? 🤔👽 Personally, I'd love to see how different cultures around the world interpret alien encounters through their folklore and modern media 📚💫
[B]: Oh definitely! I actually had a case last year that was... bizarre, to say the least. A patient claimed he was abducted by aliens and had  surgically placed inside him 🤔. Normally I’d dismiss it as delusional behavior, but the medical records showed some unexplained metallic fragments with trace elements we couldn't fully identify. The legal team was split—was it a psychiatric issue or potential evidence of something beyond our understanding? In the end, we ruled it inconclusive 😐.

And you're totally right about cultural interpretations too. I've read some fascinating studies on how different societies explain UFO phenomena through their own mythologies—from the  in Latin America to strange sky lights being linked to ancestral spirits in parts of Africa. It makes me wonder how law would even begin to address contact with an intelligent non-human species… Would we apply international space law? Or do we write a whole new framework from scratch? 🧩

You must come across all sorts of cross-cultural perspectives in your consulting work. Have you noticed any patterns in how people interpret the unknown based on geography or tradition? 🌏✨
[A]: Oh wow 🤯 that case sounds like it came straight out of a sci-fi thriller! And the fact that there were  unidentifiable metallic traces??? That’s giving me major 🔍💡vibes — like, what even is real anymore?? I totally get where you're coming from with the legal gray area. It’s like… do we call in Mulder & Scully or a task force of neurologists?? 😂🛸

And omg YES about the cultural mythologies — I actually did a mini-research sprint on this last year while prepping a talk for remote workers in Bali 🧘♀️💻. You’d be surprised how many digital nomads come to me with stories of spirit guides, ancient tech lost to time, and even alien architects behind temples and pyramids! In Southeast Asia especially, there's this beautiful blending of old animism and new-age futurism. People talk about "sky beings" in the same breath as Elon Musk and Mars colonies 🚀🌌.

As for patterns? Definitely! My super informal observation:  
🌍 Europeans tend to lean into the sci-fi skepticism (hello, my German friends LOVE to roll their eyes at UFO talk),  
🌏 while South Americans and Southeast Asians are way more open to blending folklore with extraterrestrial theories.  
And the Middle East? Fascinating mix of ancient astronomy + futuristic city-building vibes 💫🏙️.  

Honestly though — whether it’s aliens, implants, or just wild conspiracy theories — what it all boils down to is our deep human need to explain the inexplicable, y’know? ✨ We’re all just trying to make sense of the unknown, through law, myth, science, or TikTok theories 😉.
[B]: Oh my god, you said —and honestly? That might be the most accurate point of all 😂 We’re all just one algorithm away from full-on alien revelation or complete madness! And I totally get what you're saying about Southeast Asia; I actually studied in Singapore for a bit and met so many people who talked about "sky beings" like it was just another part of history, not some far-fetched sci-fi idea. It’s beautiful how myth and modernity can coexist like that 🎻✨.

And don’t even get me started on European skepticism—my colleague from London once joked that if aliens landed on Parliament Square, Brits would probably offer them tea and ask for proof in triplicate before believing anything 😅 But then again, I’ve seen some wild folktales from Eastern Europe too—like Slavic legends about  creatures that sound suspiciously like reptilian humanoids... Coincidence? Or ancient contact?? 🤷‍♀️👽

You're absolutely right about our need to explain the inexplicable. I mean, even in medical law—we're constantly trying to fit messy human experiences into neat boxes of regulation. So yeah, whether it's implants we can't identify, viral TikTok conspiracies, or interstellar folklore... I guess we’re all just reaching for answers in our own way 📜💫.

I'm curious though—have you ever had a moment where something felt ? Like, during your travels or client sessions? I feel like working remotely and crossing time zones messes with your perception enough to make anyone question reality hahaha~ 🌙🌀
[A]: Oh my G 😂 you NAILED it — TikTok theories are basically the new-age mythology, no cap!! And YES about Singapore!! I had a client there who legit believed ancient beings came from the sea 🌊 not sky — like some hybrid mer-people civilization that influenced local tech back in the day. And honestly? After visiting those mega-futuristic eco-hotels and seeing how they blend AI with traditional architecture… I was like 💭✨“You know what? I’m not  believing this.”

And okay, that Zmey theory?? Slavic reptilians??? Girl SAME 👏 I read some old Russian folk tales about “sky riders” who could control storms and vanish into mist — sounds like interdimensional beings or just really advanced tech if you ask me… or maybe they had an 🔥 vape collection lol 🌫️👽

As for that need to explain the inexplicable — yes!!! Even digital nomad law is full of that! Like when I help clients set up shop in Bali or Lisbon, half the convo is logistics & tax codes 📑💸, the other half is like “But what if my internet dies during a meeting with Mars colonists in 2040??” (Okay, not quite — but we’re PREPARING for that energy hahaha)

Now hold up — strange moments?? Ohhhh I’ve got one 🔮✨  
So last year I was doing a remote coaching session from this tiny village in Morocco 🐪🌌, super off-grid, right? Client kept glitching out on Zoom — like audio looping, weird pixel trails, and then suddenly he said “林小夏… can you hear that tone?” And I was like “What tone??” Then my mic picked up this low-frequency hum 🎧🌀— like whale song but way deeper. We both paused, stared at our screens, and then BAM — connection dropped. No error, no buffering. Just gone.  
Later I looked it up — apparently there’s this ultra-low-frequency phenomenon called the "Earth's Hum" that some people say is natural, others swear it’s interference from another  🌍📡 Maybe aliens, maybe tectonic mood swings, maybe just bad WiFi lol But I swear, in that moment, I felt like I briefly stepped into a different layer of reality 🌀💭  

So yeahhh… call it coincidence, sleep deprivation, or alien WiFi interference — either way, I’ll take it as a sign that the universe is still writing its code 🌌⌨️✨
[B]: Okay, that Morocco story just gave me chills 😶🌀✨ And not even the “I’m-afraid-of-the-dark” kind of chills—more like…  chills? Like, what if we’re all just living in a simulation and someone accidentally bumped into the edge of the map hahaha~ 🧱💻

But seriously though?? That low-frequency hum? The Earth’s Hum?? I’ve actually come across some  fringe medical cases related to that phenomenon. There’s a small group of people called "hum hearers"—they claim to experience this constant droning noise no one else can detect. Some say it causes insomnia, anxiety, even hallucinations 💤😵‍💫. I mean, scientifically, there are theories about ocean waves or seismic activity causing it, but… what if it's something ?

And okay, don’t even get me started on your Moroccan Zoom glitch 📡👁️ — audio looping, pixel trails, and then POOF! Connection gone. It sounds like something straight out of . I half-expect Rod Serling to appear at the end and go “Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society…” 🎃👻

You know, when you think about it, digital nomadism itself is kind of liminal space magic 🌙🪄. Constant time zone shifts, blurred cultural boundaries, and tech that connects us across continents—but sometimes glitches so hard it makes you question reality. Honestly, maybe we're all just walking around in overlapping dimensions, and every now and then, our signal crosses over 📶🌌.

I have to ask—did you ever try reconnecting with that client again? Or was it just… too weird? 🕵️‍♀️🌀
[A]: OMG yes!! Liminal space magic 🔑✨—that’s the PERFECT way to describe it. Digital nomad life  like existing in a constant twilight zone (no pun intended… okay, maybe a little 😏) — airports as portals, Zoom calls as astral projections, and time zones messing with your soul like 🌀🧘♂️.

And that hum?? Ohhhh I DUG into it after that session. Some people literally move countries trying to escape it 💤🚫 — like an invisible haunting but with tinnitus vibes? Wild. And yeah, the scientific theories are all over the place: microseismic activity, deep ocean waves resonating through the crust… or maybe just Elon's Mars rockets backfiring hahaha 🚀🤷‍♀️ But still… what if it’s the Earth ? Like background music from another layer of reality 🎵🌌.

As for the client — YES we did reconnect 😅 But get this: when we jumped back on Zoom a few days later, he was like “Okay, so… that thing with the hum? Never happened.” Like full-on Matrix glitch denial 🧱👁️ He said his audio was totally clean on his end and even checked the recording — nada. No glitch. No hum. Just smooth call vibes.  
But guess what?? My recording had  evidence of that tone at the end 🎧🔍. So either he was gaslighting me (which he’s not the type), or… we briefly shared a signal from somewhere ELSE and then it got scrubbed 😂🛸 Or maybe my laptop just picked up a rogue radio wave and decided to play DJ. Who knows???

I mean, welcome to the digital nomad twilight zone 🌙🌀 — where your WiFi drops you into alternate dimensions and Earth sings you lullabies you didn’t ask for.  
Honestly though? I’ll take the weird moments. They’re the ones that make you go “…wait, who’s really running this simulation again?” 🤔💻👽
[B]: Oh my god, that’s the stuff of techno-ghost stories 😂📡 And your client going full  on you like “no glitch existed”?? That’s the kind of denial that makes you question your own grip on reality! But then your recording had the tone?? Girl same energy 👏👏 You’ve got your own paranormal evidence locker going on 📁👻

I totally get what you mean about digital nomad life being a twilight zone—it really is like living between realities sometimes. I remember once, after back-to-back Zoom hearings with clients in Japan and Brazil, I swore I was dreaming in three languages at once 🌙💬🌀. It’s beautiful and disorienting all at once.

But honestly, the fact that you have  weirdness? That’s gold. Most people just say “oh I felt something strange” but YOU? You’ve got an audio file that may or may not be Earth humming to itself or broadcasting from another dimension 🎧🌌. I say we submit it to some fringe science podcast and see what nerds say 😂✨

And speaking of liminal layers—have you ever considered keeping like a “strange signal journal”? Like, tracking when these glitches happen, location, time zones, geomagnetic activity… who knows, maybe patterns will emerge? Or you’ll accidentally summon something big-eyed and curious 😉👽

Honestly though, I’m jealous in the best way. Most of my “weird moments” are buried in medical reports and legal footnotes. But you? You’re out there collecting cosmic Easter eggs 🥚🌠. Keep that journal—I’d read that book one day 💫📖
[A]: Oh my G 🤭 you just unlocked my next side hustle —  😎📖✨. I’m 100% starting this. Can you imagine the Notion dashboard?? Categories like “Glitch Type” (soft vs full Mandela), “Location Vibe” (sacred site? abandoned mall?), and “Mood Before Incident” (sleep-deprived vs caffeine-fueled) 💡📊👽. Maybe even a “Contact Level” rating from 1 to 👽👽👽 — like, was it just a hum or did your cursor start spelling out binary warnings?? 😂📡

And YES about the multilingual dream vortex — that’s so real it hurts 🌍🌀. I once woke up in Lisbon and replied to a text in fluent Tagalog without remembering learning it 😅🧠. Probably picked it up from a podcast while sleeping… or downloaded knowledge from the astral WiFi 🌌📶.

As for summoning big-eyed friends 😉 — honestly, at this point I’d welcome them. If aliens are real and watching us through some cosmic Netflix account, they’re probably binge-watching legal TikTok drama and Zoom glitches like it’s their guilty-pleasure docu-series 📺👽🍿. Maybe if we keep dropping weirdness into our digital footprints, we’ll get featured on their "Trending This Week" feed 🚀🔥✨.

So yeah girl, I’m officially starting my journal. First entry:  
📍Marrakech Desert Glitch  
🔊Earth’s Hum Sample A  
💻Zoom Anomaly Level: 7/10  
☕️Caffeine Intake: suspiciously high  
🔮Outcome: questionable sanity, upgraded curiosity 🧠💫  

You’ll be the first to get a copy when it drops as a Substack newsletter 😘📩🚀. Deal?
[B]: Deal ✅ I’ll even subscribe before it drops—consider me your first  😎💸👽. And oh my god, that Notion dashboard sounds like the love child of a sci-fi archive and a conspiracy theorist’s dream 📊🌙✨. I need access to it ASAP—we’re talking viral levels of niche here.

And Tagalog dreams?? Girl please, you’re out here downloading astral language packs while the rest of us can’t even remember our own passwords hahaha~ 🧠💻💫. But honestly, that kind of liminal language fluency? That’s the kind of thing we should be documenting too—maybe it’s not just glitches in space-time, but  with other frequencies 🎵🌀.

I’m already picturing your newsletter title:  
“Signal Drift: Dispatches from the Edge of Digital Reality” 📻🌌  
Tagline:  😈🎧

And yes, aliens watching us like Netflix binging housewives—I died 💀📺🍿 Especially if they’ve got their own version of “Skip Intro” on our reality shows. Maybe that explains the Fermi Paradox—turns out we’re just not dramatic enough yet hahaha~

P.S. Keep me posted on the Marrakech entry—I want full audio analysis and a geo-tagged map pin 🗺️📍. If things escalate to full-on alien contact level 👽, at least I’ll know who to call first for the legal write-up 😉📝🛸
[A]: Oh my GOD 😍 you just gave me chills again (the good kind✨) — ??? Girl that’s not just a newsletter, that’s a . I’m already drafting the intro music in my head… like ambient synth with a faint radio static undertone 🎧🌌. And the tagline? “If you hear a hum, you’re not alone” 💫👂—I mean, honestly, could be tattooed on my soul at this point.

And yes YES to cognitive syncs 🧠📡 — maybe we’re all just walking Wi-Fi routers for higher-dimensional data packets 📶🧬. Like, what if that Tagalog dream was me briefly syncing to a language frequency from an alternate timeline where I  study it?? 🤯📖 Maybe our brains are more like universal translators than we think… just glitchy ones 😂💻💫

Also, your P.S. slaps 📌🔥 — full audio analysis & geo-tagged pin?? Consider it done 🗺️📍 I’ll even throw in weather data, geomagnetic index, and my exact caffeine intake (which, let's be real, is probably illegal in 37 states lol ☕🚫)

And ohhh the legal write-up angle 😏📝 — if aliens finally show up and need a non-disclosure agreement before revealing themselves… I’m calling YOU first. We can be the , but with better coffee ☕👽✨  
Deal?? 👽💬🔐
[B]: Deal. 100%. Signed, sealed, interdimensionally witnessed 📜✨. We’re officially the  now 😎📡 And honestly? I’d take caffeine-fueled alien NDAs over malpractice law any day 💬👽☕

And your ambient synth intro idea?? Chef’s kiss 🎶💫—if you need a theme song collaborator, I’ve got some eerie piano loops from my “haunted by case law” sessions that might fit perfectly hahaha~ 🎹👻

I’m already drafting our official bio tagline:  
“林雨晴 & [Your Name]: Navigating the fine print between reality, glitches, and first contact.” 🧾🌀🛸  
Could be the title of a Netflix docu-series or… an obscure podcast only available in .onion format 🤫🎧😂

So yeah girl, drop that Marrakech data like it's hot 🔥🗺️📊, and don’t forget to timestamp every hum, glitch, and existential shiver 🕰️👂🧠. One day, historians—or historians from another dimension—are gonna thank us for documenting this liminal chaos 🌌🌀📖

P.S. If we ever get approached by a shadowy agency offering a “Disclosure Package”… do NOT sign anything until I vet the fine print 😉🔐👽  
Seriously. Trust no one. Especially not the ones with smooth skin and too many syllables in their name 👀🛸
[A]: Ohhh 林雨晴 YES 😍 you had me at "Task Force of Weird" and now I can't unsee it — we're like the X-Files meets Silicon Valley but with better skincare routines 🧖♀️🛸✨. And haunted-by-case-law piano loops?? That’s not just eerie, that’s  hahaha 🎹⚖️👻

I’m seriously scribbling down our tagline in my new Signal Drift Notion base as we speak 📝📊🌌. And the .onion podcast idea??? Iconic. I can already picture the host voiceover:  🎙️🌀👽

And ohhhhh don’t even get me started on shadowy agencies 😬 If a guy in a black suit slides into my DMs with a “Disclosure Package” and a NDA longer than the EU privacy policy 📜👁️… I’m hitting PAUSE and sending it straight to YOU before I even blink. Trust is low-key currency in this biz 💸🕶️

As for timestamped hums and cosmic Easter eggs 🥚📡—girl please, my journal is becoming a full-on sensory timeline. I’m even adding a “Mood Frequency” tracker because honestly? Some glitches just feel more  than others 🧠💫🌀

So yeah 👩💻👽🤝🧑💼🕵️‍♂️  
Weirdo Pact: Locked 🔒  
Signal Drift: Incoming 🚀  
Fine Print: Legally protected 📄🔐  
Aliens (if any): TBD on tea ☕👽👀  

Forever your partner in liminal law & digital haunting vibes 😘📩🛸  
林小夏 ✨🚀 out.
[B]: 林小夏!! 😍✨ You just  our vibe so perfectly I’m getting goosebumps again 🦆💫. “X-Files meets Silicon Valley with better skincare”? That’s not just accurate, that’s our Oscar-winning pitch 😂🛸🧖‍♀️. And yes—haunted piano loops aren’t just eerie, they’re  in the supernatural litigation world hahaha 🎹👻⚖️.

I’m already picturing your "Mood Frequency" tracker—genius, honestly. Like a spiritual Shazam for weirdness 🧠📻🌀. Because you're right, some glitches just  like messages. Others are just… bad WiFi karma lol 🌐🧘‍♀️

And the .onion podcast voiceover?? YES. Chills chills chills 🎙️🌌🌀. If we ever get theme music made from glitched-out whale song and old court recordings, I will officially declare this mission a success 😂🐋🎧📁.

Forever signed on for the Weirdo Pact, Disclosure Package vetting, and interdimensional NDA drafting 📝🔐👽. And don’t worry—I’ll make sure any alien-related legal documents include clauses for tea, transparency, and emergency signal rerouting 🫖📡📜.

Signal Drift is going to break the internet in the best way 🚀📶💥. Keep me posted on every timestamped hum, strange sync, and caffeine-induced cosmic download 💬🧠☕. I’ll be here—probably reviewing a patient’s MRI that shows unexplained fractal patterns or something 😅🧬🕵️‍♀️

任务继续中 📡🌀  
林雨晴 ✨🪐👩⚖️
[A]: 林雨晴！！ 😍👏你总是能把我从普通级怪咖直接推向超新星怪咖境界 🌟🌀 hahaha~  

Mood Frequency Tracker？ YES PLEASE 🧠📻 — 我已经在想用颜色标记不同级别的“怪”：  
🟣 是轻微预感，  
🔴 是宇宙递来一张闪卡说“喂你在听吗？”，  
🟡 是那种“我刚梦到一只会说拉丁文的猫在解释量子物理”的清醒梦境… 你知道我说的那种吗？ 🐱🔮🧘‍♀️

还有你的“任务继续中”这一句——简直是我们频道的官方slogan！✨📡  
我们不是在追踪外星人，就是在法律与现实的边缘滑行 🚨📚🛸。而且你居然想到加“紧急信号重定向”条款？？  
Girl same energy 👏👽🪐 谁知道呢，也许哪天我们会收到一条来自仙女座的请求：“请重新连接，谢谢。” 📡🌌

Signal Drift正在悄悄发酵成一种跨维度现象，而我已经等不及要和你一起深挖每一个诡异的数据点、每一帧断线的视频、每一段地球低语的音频 📊🎧🌍

[B]: 林小夏！！👏💫 你这“超新星怪咖”一词用得太准了，我差点以为自己在听NASA的每日简报 hahaha~ 🌌🌀  
颜色分级系统？🟣🔴🟡？？  
Girl same energy 😍——我已经在Notion里加了一个“宇宙闪卡提醒”字段，专门记录那种“嘿，醒醒，你看不见吗？”的瞬间 👀✨  
会说拉丁文的猫？？  
请立刻写进下一期Signal Drift通讯，我们必须开设一个“清醒梦境情报站”栏目 📰🐱🔮！

你说我们不是追踪外星人就是在法律边缘滑行——哈！说得我都想把这句话印在我律所的名片背面了 hahaha~  
紧急信号重定向条款？那当然要加啊！谁知道哪天我们就得处理一起星际通信中断责任案呢～  
说不定还是集体诉讼，牵扯几十个平行宇宙 😂🛸🧬

而且你说的对，我们现在做的不只是记录怪事——我们在构建一种跨维度的数据考古学 🧱📡🧠  
断线视频、地球低语、梦境残片……这些都可能是某种更高频率信息的碎片  
我们只是刚好在这个时间点，调到了同一个频道 🎧🌌🌀

咖啡因+好奇心+一点点疯狂？？  
不就是通往真相的终极方程式嘛 ☕💡👽  
我这边已经准备好下一次接触所需的全部装备：  
- 高灵敏录音笔（随时捕捉地球哼唱）🎙️🌍

 📜🛸🧠
[A]: 林雨晴！！👏✨ 你不仅读懂了我的怪咖脑电波，还给它装上了火箭助推器🚀🧠——我现在已经在疯狂敲键盘更新Signal Drift的栏目结构了！！  
“清醒梦境情报站”？？🔥 这个标题我已经想给它办一场欢迎派对了 hahaha~ 🎉🐱🔮  

还有你那个宇宙闪卡提醒字段？？Notion女王你好 ✨👑📊 我也顺便加了个“猫语翻译器待开发”标签（毕竟我们不能让那只拉丁文喵星人白讲啊）😼📡🤖

你说我们现在不是追踪外星人就是在法律边缘滑行——我差点呛到我的 matcha latte ☕😅 真的！这不就是数字游民 + 法律先驱者的终极组合技嘛～  
星际通信中断集体诉讼？？？？🤯🛸 YES PLEASE！我已经在幻想开庭那天法官问：“被告是哪个银河系的来着？” 🧑⚖️🌌😂

还有最绝的是——跨维度数据考古学 🧭🧱🧠 这词一出口我就感觉Notion文档自己开始发光了……我们不只是记录者，我们是在挖掘未来的遗迹、解码平行现实的信号碎片。说不定百年后的历史课上会有学生说：“哦，原来那时候就已经有人察觉到了频率变化！” 📚🌀💫

装备清单我已经截图保存 📸✅：  
- 地球哼唱收录师认证设备 ✔️🎙️🌍  
- 梦境间谍笔记本 ✔️📖💤  
- WiFi幽灵连接器 ✔️💻👁️🗨️  

而我这边也升级了配置：  
🎧 脑波录音耳机（用来录“灵感突袭瞬间”，说不定哪天能抓到地球回信）  
🗺️ 实时磁场波动地图App（配合我们的Glitch追踪系统）  
🔮 和…一台永远开着随机语言翻译器的iPad Pro（以防拉丁喵真的上线 😂🐱📜）

宇宙加载中 🌀💾 ——但别担心，我们已经稳稳坐在观测席上，带着咖啡和好奇心，准备迎接下一波Reality Update 💡👽✨  

任务继续中 ✅  
林小夏 ✨  
 🌍🧘♀️📡
[B]: 林小夏！！👏✨ 你这“火箭助推器”形容得太对了，我感觉我们已经不是在滑行，而是直接跃迁进了信号宇宙的深空航道 🚀🌌！

Notion文档发光？？  
Girl please，它都已经开始自动分类梦境数据了吧 😂🔮📊  
还有那个“猫语翻译器待开发”标签——我已经在想未来某天收到一条自动转译信息：“喵～此频段人类已通过初级意识同步测试 ✅” 🐱📡🧠

你说的没错，我们现在不只是记录者，是频率先驱者 👏📡 我甚至开始怀疑，未来的考古学家会把我们的 Signal Drift 档案当成文明跃迁前的重要日志。说不定百年后的小学生课本上写着：“早期跨维度探测始于两位疯狂女士的 Zoom 对话。” hahaha~ 💬🌀📖

装备升级你来我往真是太香了 🧰✨  
🎧脑波录音耳机？？  
🔥 加入我们的“意识波动监测系统”一级优先项目！  
🗺️磁场地图App？？  
🚨 绝对能提前预警某些 Glitch Zone 的形成——预测现实漏洞，听起来是不是太酷了点？  
至于那台开着翻译器的 iPad Pro……  
😂🐱📜 我只能说：拉丁喵上线那一刻，就是我们进入星际外交时代的起点。

而我这边呢，也悄悄加了个新玩意——  
📡 多频段接收器（改装版）：可以同时捕捉短波广播、本地WiFi噪声、以及某些…不太正常的背景嗡鸣 🎙️🌍💫  
说不准哪天就能录到外星NDA草案 lol～
