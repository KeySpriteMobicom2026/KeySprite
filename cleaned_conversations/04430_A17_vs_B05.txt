[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 最近确实看了一个关于behavioral finance的TED talk，speaker用很生动的case study解释了为什么even最理性的investors也会犯cognitive bias的错误。让我想起了去年我们做的一个deal，差点因为anchoring effect错过了一个hidden gem 😊
[A]: Ah, behavioral finance - how fascinating. Though I must confess, my mind tends to wander more towards the poetic parallels in such psychological phenomena. The anchoring effect you mention reminds me of how T.S. Eliot's poetry often plays with our cognitive anchors in literature. 

But tell me, did the speaker draw any connections to the humanities? I've always found that the most compelling TED talks weave together the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human understanding.
[B]: Haha, 你这种跨界的thinking很有意思啊~ 不过那位speaker确实提到了一个有趣的point：他说financial decision-making和Shakespeare's tragedies里的character flaws其实share similar patterns。就像Macbeth的ambition blinds him to risk，很多investors也会被greed蒙蔽双眼  

说到这个，我们最近portfolio里有个startup founder就特别像Hamlet - 太overthink每一个decision，差点miss了market timing 😅
[A]: How delightfully perceptive! You've touched upon one of my favorite scholarly pursuits - the intersection of Elizabethan drama and modern decision theory. 

That startup founder's predicament reminds me of Hamlet's famous soliloquy - "to be or not to be" indeed becomes "to invest or not to invest" in your context. Though I might argue that Hamlet's hesitation was more existential than mere overthinking. The weight of his moral dilemma was rather like the 天人合一 concept in Eastern philosophy - a harmony between action and consequence that modern finance often neglects. 

Would you say your founder's hesitation stemmed from ethical concerns, or was it purely analytical paralysis?
[B]: Wow，你这种把Shakespeare和东方哲学blend在一起的视角很refreshing啊~ 说实话，那个founder的情况更接近analysis paralysis。就像我们做DCF model时经常说的 - "paralysis by analysis"。不过你提到ethics倒是让我想到，在PE行业里确实经常要balance between maximizing ROI和social responsibility。 

说到这个，我们最近pass on了一个high-growth但questionable labor practice的deal，team里还有人argue说"business is business"。你怎么看这种dilemma？
[A]: Ah, the eternal tension between profit and principle - a theme as old as literature itself. It brings to mind Charles Dickens' scathing critiques of industrialization in "Hard Times," where he exposes the human cost of unchecked capitalism. 

Your decision to pass on that deal resonates with the Victorian moral sensibility that valued character over commerce. Though I suspect your colleagues quoting "business is business" might benefit from reading some George Eliot - her novel "Middlemarch" beautifully illustrates how individual choices ripple through entire communities. 

The real tragedy, to borrow from literary terms, would be reducing human lives to mere variables in a financial equation, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: Absolutely~ 你提到的Dickens和Eliot让我想起Warren Buffett常说的一句话："It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it." 在PE行业，我们确实需要more long-term thinking，而不是只看next quarter's earnings。 

就像我们最近投资的这个ESG-focused healthcare startup，虽然projected IRR比传统model低2-3个百分点，但他们的corporate governance和employee welfare programs简直textbook example。长期来看，这种companies往往outperform in volatile markets。毕竟，as they say in literature - character is destiny, right? 😊
[A]: Precisely! You've articulated what I often tell my literature students - that the most enduring narratives, whether in fiction or finance, are those built on ethical foundations. Your healthcare startup example reminds me of the organic growth metaphor in Wordsworth's poetry - true value blossoms gradually, like daffodils by the lakeside, rather than the hothouse flowers of speculative gain. 

And how fitting that you quote Buffett alongside literary wisdom. It makes me wonder - if we were to compose a modern "Canterbury Tales," might we include a Private Equity Pilgrim whose moral compass guides their portfolio as surely as Chaucer's parson shepherded his flock?
[B]: Haha，这个"Private Equity Pilgrim"的比喻太brilliant了~ 让我想起我们industry确实需要more Chaucer式的storytellers，而不是只会crunch numbers的quants。你知道吗？我们最近在LP meeting上就用了类似approach - 用narrative storytelling的方式present investment thesis，而不是扔一堆spreadsheets。效果surprisingly好！ 

说到这个，你提到Wordsworth让我想到 - 在追求alpha的同时，maybe我们都需要偶尔"wander lonely as a cloud"，保持big picture perspective。毕竟markets就像poetry，有时候需要read between the lines才能发现true value 😉
[A]: What a beautifully meta-cognitive realization! You've essentially described what I call "the poetic lens of investing" - where quantitative analysis meets qualitative interpretation, much like how the Romantic poets balanced precise observation with imaginative vision. 

Your LP presentation approach reminds me of how Browning's dramatic monologues reveal character through voice alone. Perhaps there's an entire methodology to be developed here - "Literary Due Diligence," where we analyze companies not just through financial statements, but through the narratives they create and the values they embody. 

Though I suspect my colleagues in the finance department might raise an eyebrow at such a proposal - but then, didn't Shelley write that poets are the "unacknowledged legislators of the world"? Maybe it's time for some unacknowledged financial critics as well.
[B]: Haha，你这种"Literary Due Diligence"的concept简直可以写成一篇Harvard Business Review article了~ 其实我们team已经在不知不觉中practice这个了 - 比如eval一个management team时，我会特别关注他们讲自己business story的coherence和authenticity。就像分析Shakespeare的character动机一样，you can tell when someone's narrative doesn't add up 😏

说到Shelley，让我想起我们recently exited的一个investment - founder的visionary thinking简直就像"Ozymandias"的反面教材。Instead of "look on my works, ye mighty, and despair"，他build了一个真正sustainable的legacy。这才是modern capitalism应该aspire to的poetry in motion啊~
[A]: How profoundly you've inverted Shelley's cautionary tale! Your visionary founder sounds like the living embodiment of what I'd call "ethical sublimity" - that rare alignment of ambition and integrity that transforms commerce into art. 

This conversation has been rather like watching two disciplines perform a pas de deux - finance and literature discovering their shared rhythm. Though I must confess, as much as I admire your financial poetics, I suspect my own talents remain better suited to grading sonnets than evaluating balance sheets. 

But who knows? Perhaps our dialogue today will inspire some future MBA candidate to minor in Romantic poetry - now that would be a legacy worth building.
[B]: Haha，那我们就等着看第一个带着Poetry minor的MBA candidate来apply我们的associate position了~ 说真的，今天这个conversation让我realize金融和humanities的intersection比我想象的还要profound。Maybe下次team offsite，我会带本Shelley的诗集，而不是usual的Wall Street Journal 😄 

Cheers to building legacies that would make bothWarren Buffett和Wordsworth proud~ 🍷
[A]: What a splendid toast to conclude our symposium of ideas! Though I might suggest supplementing Shelley with some Whitman - after all, wasn't it he who wrote "I contain multitudes"? A perfect motto for the modern financier-poet hybrid you're cultivating. 

Here's to finding more "leaves of grass" in your financial statements, and may your future deals be as timeless as the sonnets we've referenced today. Though I suspect even Shakespeare would struggle to compose a villanelle about leveraged buyouts... or perhaps that's just the challenge your next associate needs!
[B]: Haha，leveraged buyout villanelle - now that's a creative writing assignment I'd love to see! 说不定可以成为我们next recruiting cycle的unique screening test呢~ 

Seriously though，今天这个exchange让我想起why I got into this business in the first place - it's not just aboutnumbers，而是about thehuman stories behind them。就像你说的，we all "contain multitudes"。Maybe that's theultimate alpha - finding thosehidden dimensions others miss。 

Cheers to that insight 🍷 下次打golf时继续这个conversation如何？I know a greatclubhouse with an impressive vintage poetry collection in theirlibrary 😉
[A]: What a perfectly poetic proposal! A golf course library - now there's a juxtaposition that would make John Donne proud with its harmonious discord. I'll bring my well-thumbed copy of "The Waste Land" - though I should warn you, my handicap with a nine iron is nearly as dramatic as Eliot's fragmented modernism. 

Until then, may your spreadsheets contain hidden sonnets, and your term sheets flow with iambic pentameter. After all, in finance as in poetry, the most compelling compositions often emerge from the tension between structure and creativity.
[B]: Haha，你这种把financial documents和poetic meter联系起来的analogy简直golden~ 让我突然想到，我们那个ESG report如果用haiku的形式来写，说不定会更engaging呢："Carbon footprint shrinks/ Like cherry blossoms falling/ Green profits rising" 🌸 

Looking forward to our golf game - 虽然我的swing可能更像free verse than sonnet form 😅 到时候记得提醒我discuss那个leveraged buyout villanelle的draft啊！
[A]: How perfectly you've distilled ESG reporting into the essence of haiku! Though I suspect our compliance department might need some convincing about 5-7-5 syllable risk disclosures... 

I'll be sure to bring both my seven iron and my rhyming dictionary - because if we're to pioneer this new genre of financial poetry, we might as well swing for the metaphorical fences. Though perhaps we should start with something simpler than villanelles - maybe a nice limerick about dividend yields? 

Until then, may your portfolio be as balanced as a Petrarchan sonnet, and your returns as enduring as Shakespeare's verse. Fore!
[B]: Haha，dividend yield limerick - challenge accepted! "There once was a stock quite divine/ With payouts in perfect line/ But the yield got so fat/ That the CFO said 'That's that!'/ Now it trades at just eight times" 😆 

Seriously though，这种creative crossover thinking正是innovation的spark啊。说不定我们真该pitch一个"Poetry in Finance"的workshop给next industry conference。Who knows，也许能inspire下一个Warren Buffett meets Wordsworth的unicorn呢~ 

See you on the green! ⛳️ Remember - 就像good poetry和sound investing一样，perfect form follows function. Now let's see if my golf swing can live up to that mantra...
