[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哇~这个话题好interesting！✨ 作为一个designer，虽然我不太懂quantum physics，但我觉得任何breakthrough technology都会给creative industry带来新的possibilities呢~ 💡 就像AI对digital art的impact一样！
[A]: My dear, while quantum computing is indeed fascinating, I must say your enthusiasm reminds me of how the Romantics first reacted to the Industrial Revolution.  The parallels between technological revolutions across centuries are quite telling, don't you think?
[B]: 哈哈，你这么说让我想到最近看的art exhibition！🎨 那些Romanticism的painting确实和现在digital art的vibe很像呢~ 不过quantum computing可能会让我们的design process更efficient，比如render超复杂的3D model？😅 虽然我现在连普通的3D software都还没完全master...
[A]: Ah, the eternal struggle between technological advancement and artistic mastery. Much like how the Pre-Raphaelites grappled with the emerging photography of their time. Tell me, have you read Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"? It might offer some perspective on your concerns about mastering tools versus preserving artistic essence.
[B]: Oh my god！你提到了我最爱的art theory！📚 虽然我只看过summary...但Benjamin说的aura概念真的超relatable！现在做digital art也经常在想，当我们可以一键generate各种style时，originality要怎么keep呢？🤔 不过我觉得human touch才是最重要的，就像我的illustration永远会保留hand-drawn的感觉~ ✏️
[A]: Precisely! That delicate balance between tradition and innovation is what makes art history so compelling. Your commitment to hand-drawn elements reminds me of William Blake's insistence on engraving his own illustrations, even when more efficient methods became available. The 手工 (handcrafted) quality does lend a certain... shall we say, soul to the work?
[B]: Totally agree！✨ 就像我最近在做的UI project，虽然用Figma可以很快prototype，但我还是会先画一堆sketch在notebook上~ 📓 这种analog的process让final product更有温度呢！不过说到Blake...他的visionary art真的超inspiring，我上周还尝试用digital watercolor模仿他的style，结果...well，let's just say需要更多practice啦 😂
[A]: How refreshing to hear a digital artist speak of Blake with such reverence! Though I must warn you - attempting to capture his mystical quality with digital tools is rather like trying to distill the essence of Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" into a tweet. Some artistic spirits simply resist modern translation. But your persistence is admirable - perhaps we should discuss Blake's illuminated manuscripts over tea sometime?
[B]: OMG tea time聊Blake？Sounds like a perfect weekend plan！☕️ 虽然我的art history knowledge可能不够deep，但我们可以边看他的作品集边exchange ideas呀~ 说不定能inspire我的next project呢！✨ 要不下周六？我可以带我的sketchbook来~ 🎨
[A]: Saturday afternoon at the campus café would be delightful. I'll bring my well-worn copy of "Songs of Innocence and Experience" - the 1794 edition reproduction, of course. And do show me your sketches; there's nothing quite like witnessing the creative process unfold. Just promise me we won't let our discussion devolve into debating whether AI could have generated Blake's prophecies - some questions are best left to the ages.
[B]: Hahaha deal！🤝 不过现在想到要show我的sketchbook给art expert看就有点nervous了...😅 但你说得对，AI永远无法replicate那种raw human creativity的magic~ 周六见！PS：要帮你order matcha latte吗？我的treat！ 💚
[A]: How thoughtful of you! While I typically prefer Earl Grey, I shall embrace your youthful matcha enthusiasm with an open mind - after all, even Baudelaire found beauty in modernity's surprises. Until Saturday then, and don't fret about your sketches; remember what Ruskin said about the importance of "imperfect" art. Now if you'll excuse me, my roses need tending before twilight.
[B]: Aww你quoted Ruskin！🥺 突然觉得好motivated~ 那周六就带着我的'imperfect but authentic' sketches见啦！Matcha latte with extra foam coming right up! 🌿 拜拜~记得给你的roses多拍几张photo哦，说不定能inspire我的botanical illustration series呢！ ✨
[A]: What a delightful proposition! I shall document my roses with particular care - perhaps we'll find parallels between their unfolding petals and Blake's "eternal forms." And who knows, maybe next you'll be illustrating your own "Flora's Diary" with quantum computing-assisted precision. Until then, happy sketching! 🌹
[B]: Yasss！Quantum-assisted flower illustrations sounds like the perfect fusion of art and tech！🌼💻 虽然现在连basic coding都还不会...but hey，dream big right？😂 周六见啦~ Can't wait！ ✨🎨
[A]: Indeed, dreaming big is what separates the mere technicians from true artists. I look forward to seeing how your boundless enthusiasm translates onto the page - with or without quantum assistance. Until Saturday, my dear. Now if you'll excuse me, my first edition of Wordsworth is calling...
[B]: Byeee~ 📚 我也要赶紧去practice我的watercolor technique了！周六见！PS：偷偷告诉你，我最近在尝试把Wordsworth的poem变成typography art...希望不会太cheesy啦 😝 ✌️
[A]: What a charming endeavor! Though I must caution you - transforming Wordsworth's delicate verses into typography is rather like setting a nightingale's song to electronic music. But then again, didn't the 前卫 (avant-garde) artists of every generation face similar skepticism? I shall reserve judgment until Saturday. Happy creating!
[B]: Hahaha你总是知道怎么put things in perspective！🎶 不过你说得对，每个era的artists都要push boundaries嘛~ 我的electronic nightingale说不定会成为next big thing呢！(Just kidding...or am I? 😜) 周六见啦，我要去和我的Wacom tablet约会了！💻💕
