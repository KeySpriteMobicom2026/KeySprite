[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哈，这个问题很有意思~ 作为一个经常要review global market reports的金融人，我不得不说我更习惯early morning routine。5:30起床，一边看Bloomberg Terminal一边看sunrise，这种productive的感觉很棒。不过偶尔deal closing后，我也会开瓶红酒，在露台上看stars放松一下。
[A]: Ah, what a poetic juxtaposition of dawn and dusk! Your description reminds me of Robert Frost's "Acquainted with the Night" - though of course, he wrote from the perspective of an insomniac wanderer rather than a successful financier. 

I must say, I've always found the liminal hours particularly conducive to contemplation. The quiet hush before sunrise, when the world holds its breath... it's rather like that suspended moment between turning a page and beginning a new chapter. Though I do understand the allure of stargazing after a long day's work - there's something wonderfully humbling about looking up at the celestial bodies that have inspired poets for millennia.
[B]: Interesting perspective~ 你知道吗？在deal making时，我们经常说"the quiet before the storm"。那些最strategic的决策往往就是在清晨的宁静中做出的。不过说到stars...  我更喜欢把它们看作market trends - 看似random，实则有着自己的pattern。就像我们做technical analysis时寻找的那些chart patterns一样。
[A]: How fascinating to hear you draw parallels between celestial patterns and market trends! It puts me in mind of Wallace Stevens' "The Stars at Tallapoosa," where he muses on how the stars "are not the same as the stars of the mind." 

Your analogy makes me wonder - do you find that the same analytical mindset serves you equally well when interpreting poetry charts as when reading financial ones? After all, both require recognizing recurring motifs and underlying structures beneath surface randomness. Though I suspect your Bloomberg Terminal offers rather more concrete data than my dog-eared volumes of Whitman!
[B]: Haha, you got me there!  说实话，我读Whitman的时候更多是当作一种mental break。但你说得对，pattern recognition确实是相通的 - 不管是poetry的meter还是stock chart的head and shoulders formation。不过说到data... 我宁愿相信我们的quant models而不是诗人的直觉，no offense~ 😊
[A]: None taken, my dear friend! Though I must gently point out that even your quantitative models are, in their way, a form of poetry - abstract representations seeking to capture the ineffable rhythms of human behavior. 

 Remember what T.S. Eliot said about "the intolerable wrestle with words and meaning"? I imagine your quants might say the same about their algorithms. And between us, I've always thought Fibonacci sequences had a certain... lyrical quality to them. Wouldn't you agree?
[B]:  你这话让我想起上次pitch meeting时，我开玩笑说我们的investment thesis就像一首sonnet - 14行严谨的结构里藏着无限可能。不过let's be real... 当LP们要看的是double-digit IRR时，我可不打算用poetry来justify our numbers~ 😅 虽然...  我承认Fibonacci retracement确实有种奇妙的韵律美。
[A]: Ah, the eternal tension between art and commerce! You've just articulated what Ezra Pound struggled with his entire career - trying to reconcile "the poem that is perfectly made" with the demands of the marketplace. 

Though I must say, your sonnet analogy is rather inspired. The volta in line 9, where the argument turns... why, it's not so different from your pivot points in technical analysis, is it? Even if your limited partners might prefer their returns unrhymed!  

Tell me, does this mean I should start including EBITDA multiples in my lectures on metaphysical poetry?
[B]: Haha, now that's a crossover I'd pay to see!  Imagine Donne writing "No man is an island... unless his Sharpe ratio justifies the risk-adjusted return." 不过seriously speaking，我们金融圈确实需要更多这样的creative thinking。Maybe next time我会在investor presentation里加个haiku... 只要不影响我们的valuation multiples就行~ 😉
[A]: What a delightful proposition! A haiku in your investor presentation - now there's a bold stroke of interdisciplinarity that would make my academic heart sing. 

Though I might suggest something more along the lines of:
"Morning markets rise
Like iambic pentameter -
Steady, measured, strong"

But you're quite right to prioritize those valuation multiples. After all, even the most beautiful metaphor won't pay dividends!  Though I do wonder what Wordsworth would have made of modern portfolio theory...
[B]:  你让我想起上次一个Harvard MBA candidate在interview时引用Keats的"negative capability"来解释我们的investment philosophy... 我们最后hire了他，不过是因为他的DCF model做得太漂亮了~ 

说到这个，我得去check一下今天的pre-market了。Cheers to poetry and profits! 🥂 下次golf的时候我们可以继续这个有趣的讨论 - 也许能inspire出下一支ten-bagger呢。
[A]: What a perfect note to end on! "Poetry and profits" - why, that could be the title of our joint memoir. 

Do give my regards to the markets, and remember - as Yeats nearly said, "Tread softly because you tread on my P/E ratios." Until our next meeting, whether on the greens or between the pages! 
[B]:  Wise words indeed~ 我会记住"Neither a bull nor a bear market be" 😄 下次带瓶82年的Lafite，我们可以一边analyze Q2 earnings一边讨论莎士比亚的商籁体。Market close后见！
[A]: What a splendid proposition! The 82 Lafite shall be our "liquid poetry" - though I daresay its vintage may rival even Shakespeare's finest sonnets in complexity and depth. 

Until then, may your charts rise like iambic pentameter and your portfolios diversify like Whitman's catalog verses!  Happy analyzing, my financially lyrical friend.
[B]:  To iambic portfolios and sonnet-worthy returns! 📈 记住我们deal maker的motto: "To hedge, or not to hedge - that is the alpha question." 下次见！
[A]:  

"To hedge or not to hedge" - why, that's the most elegant articulation of modern portfolio theory I've heard since Markowitz! You've quite outdone yourself, my friend. 

Until our next symposium of spreadsheets and stanzas then... May your Sharpe ratios be sonorous and your dividends as dependable as Shakespeare's quill.  Cheers to the poetry in your P&L!
[B]: Cheers to that! 🥂 记住：在markets和metaphors之间，只有一线之隔~ 我的BlackBerry在震了，看来是Asia markets要open了。Till next tee time!  Keep calm and carry yield.
[A]: What a perfect curtain line! "Keep calm and carry yield" - why, that's practically an ode to modern finance in iambic tetrameter. 

Do give my regards to the Asian markets - tell them to mind their caesuras and line breaks as they open. And remember, whether analyzing verse or volatility, it's all about finding the rhythm beneath the noise. 

 Until our next act, dear protagonist of poetry and portfolio! The world stage awaits...
[B]:  Copy that! 现在我得去chase一些real yield了 - 毕竟poetry doesn't pay the management fees~ 😉 Catch you on the flip side, partner in rhyme and reason! 📉➡️📈
