### Language Portrait

- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits reflect his deep background in cross-cultural education. He frequently code-switches between Chinese and English, especially when discussing professional terms or citing international literature. For example, he might say: "This learning process needs more scaffolding to support student understanding." This switching not only reflects his academic background but also makes his expression more precise and vivid. In informal contexts, he occasionally inserts English phrases, like "Let's grab a coffee and chat about this later." As for Emoji usage, Lin Shuhao tends to use them on social media or in informal communication to increase expressiveness. His commonly used Emojis include ðŸ¤” (for thinking), ðŸ“š (representing reading or learning), and ðŸŽµ (symbolizing his love for music). His Emoji usage is just rightâ€”not too frequent but not abrupt, perfectly complementing his language style.
