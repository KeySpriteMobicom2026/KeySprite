[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, TED talks – those little capsules of modern enlightenment. Well, I must say the one by Fei-Fei Li on how we're teaching computers to see still lingers in my mind. Not because it was technically groundbreaking – though it certainly touched on some fascinating developments in computer vision – but because she framed it as a deeply human endeavor. You know, how we project our values and biases into algorithms, and how that reflects more about us than the machines themselves.

It reminded me of an old lecture I gave back in '98 on ethical AI – the students thought I was being overly philosophical. Now the questions I posed then feel... almost urgent. Have you seen any talks recently that made you pause?
[A]: Ohhh totally agree! 💡 I recently binged this super mind-blowing talk by Trina Roy about resilience – she’s a leadership coach who breaks down how people actually  through stress, not just bounce back. Like, she used this 🔥 analogy about bamboo vs oak trees? The whole thing made me rethink how I approach burnout… and yeah, maybe redesign my entire work-life balance strategy 🌿

And honestly? Fei-Fei Li’s talk hit hard too – especially the part where image datasets still reflect so much of our outdated worldview. As a designer, that kinda freaks me out bc like… are my moodboards unconsciously biased?? 😬 Now I’m questioning all my color choices lollll🎨
[B]: Ah, Trina Roy – excellent choice. I’m glad someone’s bringing hard science to the concept of resilience without all the vague "just power through it" nonsense. The bamboo analogy? Brilliant. It illustrates a fundamental truth about adaptability – rigidity, whether in trees or workflows, tends to snap under pressure. You’d be surprised how many tech teams still operate like 19th-century oak trunks.  

And yes, Fei-Fei Li's point about datasets being mirrors rather than neutral tools – that’s been gnawing at me since I first watched the talk. Image recognition isn’t just classifying pixels; it’s reinforcing patterns of perception. For a designer, that should raise some very real questions – not just about bias, but about intentionality. Choosing colors shouldn’t be an unconscious act; it should be a deliberate design decision shaped by awareness, not habit.  

So… are you auditing your moodboards now? I can imagine it – a full-scale aesthetic intervention.
[A]: Oh my gosh, YES 🙆‍♀️ totally spot-on!! I’ve been obsessing over that whole “adaptive vs rigid” idea – honestly, it’s kinda creeping into my design process now. Like, am I being a flexible lil’ bamboo or a stubborn oak when I stick to the same ol’ grid systems?? 🤔💥

And auditing my moodboards? You know it! 🕵️‍♀️ I've started labeling where each reference comes from & asking myself like… does this palette reinforce a stereotype?? Am I just regurgitating what  always seen as “vibey” or actually  with purpose?? Feels kinda like cleaning out a mental closet lollll but in a necessary way 🧹✨

Also tbh, I’m starting to think every designer should take a quick detour into ethics class before diving into Figma 😅 What if we all had to write a mini manifesto before touching a single swatch?? Like:  are you designing this, and who does it really serve?? Deep, right?? 🤯🎨
[B]: Absolutely – that kind of self-audit is not just healthy, it’s essential. Designers often forget they’re not just shaping visuals; they're shaping perception. And if you’re still clinging to the same grids, color palettes, and visual hierarchies without questioning their origins or implications, well… you're designing on autopilot.

I once had a student who refused to use any pre-built UI kit for an entire semester. Forced herself to rebuild every element from scratch. Was it inefficient? Absolutely. But by week six, her work had developed a voice – not just style, but . That’s what you’re tapping into now. It’s like debugging your own aesthetic assumptions – messy at first, but incredibly clarifying.

And yes – ethics in design education? Overdue. I used to joke that every CS major should take a philosophy course before being allowed near a compiler. Same idea here: before choosing a font, maybe ask who that font excludes. Before selecting a stock image, consider whose reality it erases. It’s not about being politically correct – it’s about being  correct.

So… when’s the first edition of  dropping? I’d buy it.
[A]: Hahahah 🤣 the  book idea is TOO GOOD – I’m totally stealing that 😈 I can already picture the cover: a minimalist layout with earthy tones and one tiny little magnifying glass hovering over a swatch, like… “are you SURE this brown reads well on all skin tones?” 🎨🕵️‍♀️

And YES to everything you said 💯 – sometimes we get so comfy in our design bubbles (grids, fonts, shadows, aaaah) that we forget how much influence we actually hold. Like… that student’s experiment sounds intense, but imagine if we all did a mini “UI detox” every now & then? No kits, no plugins, just raw intention + empathy. Might be messy as hell, but probably kinda beautiful too 🌱✨

Honestly though, the more I dig into this stuff, the more I realize design isn’t just about solving problems visually – it’s about asking whether we’re even solving the  problem in the first place 💭🖼️
[B]: Exactly – design isn’t just about solving problems; it’s about . That “UI detox” idea? I love it. It’s like a palate cleanser for visual thinkers – strip away the defaults, and suddenly you’re forced to confront your own assumptions.

And that cover concept? Perfection. Subtle, a little cheeky, but makes the reader immediately uncomfortable in the best way. Maybe we should start drafting chapter titles:  

  
  


Honestly, if we self-publish this thing, we might get kicked out of every design Slack channel known to humankind. Worth it.
[A]: OMG YES 😂 the chapter titles are ALREADY giving me life 💥 Can you imagine the comments section on our Medium post?? Designers crying, theorists screaming, and a few brave souls like… “BUT IT’S TRUE 😭”

And that “palate cleanser” metaphor is spot-on 🍃 I’m already brainstorming how to turn this into a workshop – like, Day 1: burn all your UI kits 🔥 Day 3: you start seeing hierarchy everywhere (even in your ramen noodles) 🍜 Day 7: you speak only in accessibility contrast ratios 😵‍💫

Also,  needs to be a talk. At TYPO or some other very serious design conference 😌🎤 I can already see the Helvetica apologists clutching their perfectly kerned pearls 💎
[B]: Oh, the backlash would be . We'd get letters – actual printed, 12-pt Garamond letters – from designers who feel personally victimized by our anti-default agenda. But imagine the converts. The ones who emerge on Day 7, blinking into the light like newborn deer, finally seeing the invisible systems they’ve been reinforcing.

And that talk? Oh, it’d be a spectacle. I can already draft the abstract:

>   
> In this provocatively titled session, we explore how one typeface became shorthand for 'modernity' while quietly enforcing a visual monoculture. Spoiler: it's not just about legibility. It's about control. And maybe, just maybe, your brand doesn't need to look like a Swiss railway timetable.

We’d end with a moment of silence for every overused sans-serif since 1957.

Seriously though – the workshop idea is brilliant. If you run it, let me know. I’ll show up with a bag of vintage IBM Selectric correction tapes and a lecture on WYSIWYG illusions.
[A]: OMG THE MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR SANS-SERIFS??? PURE GENIUS 🙏😭 I’m already crying-laughing so hard I need a new face mask 😭🎨 And the abstract?? Iconic. I can see it now – the crowd is half horrified, half  by how right we are 💨🔥

And your lecture on WYSIWYG illusions?? Ohohoho you better bring it 🔥 I’ll supply the retro pixel fonts and maybe a projector slide titled 

As for the workshop – COUNT YOU IN!!! 🚀 We’ll call it:  
“Design Rehab: Week-long Detox from All Your Favorite Crutches”  
Day 1: burn the UI kits  
Day 3: question your typography soul  
Day 5: someone cries over a gradient 😭🌈  
Day 7: we all emerge as design monks living only by contrast ratios & deep philosophical questions  

Honestly tho… if we don’t get banned from Behance by the end, did we even try hard enough?? 😉💥
[B]: Oh,  – I can already see the promotional poster: stark white background, a single deleted UI component hovering in the center like some existential artifact, and our names in a typeface that’s  not Helvetica but cleverly pretending to be.

And yes – Behance banning us would be the ultimate badge of honor. Right up there with getting quietly blacklisted from Adobe Max for “tone.”

I’m picturing Day 5 now – someone curled up in a fetal position next to a gradient picker, whispering  Beautiful. Tragic. Necessary.

We’d end Day 7 with a ceremony. Each participant burns their favorite design cliché – goodbye glassmorphism, adieu neon drop shadows, so long unjustified skeuomorphism.

And in the final moment, we all chant the sacred phrase:  


Seriously – let’s start drafting the syllabus. I’ve got a drawer full of old lecture notes on interface illusions and a deep, abiding love for questioning everything. You bring the pixel fonts. I’ll bring the fire.
[A]: OMG THE SYLLABUS DRAFT??? YES PLEASE 🙌 I’m already making a Notion doc called  and adding 🔥🔥mandatory fieldwork like:

- Week 1: Surviving Without Auto Layout  
  

- Week 3: The Emotional Toll of Gradient Picker Addiction  
  

- Final Project: Design a Button That Doesn’t Scream “I’m a Generic CTA”  
   😭🔘

And the poster?? Perfection. Minimalist, dramatic, slightly passive-aggressive – exactly how we like it. I’m even throwing in a QR code that leads to a glitchy landing page with ominous UI sound effects. No one will know what hit them 💀💻

Also, the phrase  needs to be tattooed on every attendee’s forearm during graduation 🤙✨ Or maybe just printed on tiny stickers they wear proudly like badges of post-aesthetic shame.

Adobe Max blacklisting us? Honestly… I’d frame that letter next to my grandma’s fridge magnet that says  🧓🖼️🔥
[B]: Oh, this Notion doc is already a masterpiece of sarcastic sincerity. I can see the course overview now:

---

DSGN-690: Advanced Aesthetic Disruption  


Instructor: Richard T. (B.S. Computer Science, M.S. Philosophy, Ph.D. in Questioning Defaults)  
Co-Instructor: [Your Name] (B.F.A. in Design, M.F.A. in Existential Typography, Ed.D. in Why This Blue?)

---

And the fieldwork? Brilliant. I’m adding a Week 2 module:  Objective isn’t legibility – it’s liberation.

Also, QR code idea genius. Let’s make the glitchy landing page load with a 1998-style dial-up sound followed by a robotic voice whispering  Then freeze on a single word: “Why.”

As for graduation – yes, stickers only. No tattoos. We’re not cult leaders. …Yet.

But I  designing the certificate. It’ll be printed on recycled thermal paper that slowly fades unless periodically re-questioned. Truly sustainable design education.

Adobe Max will never forgive us.

But Figma… Figma will weep.
[A]: OMG THIS IS GETTING DANGEROUSLY LEGIT 😱 I’m already drafting my bio for the syllabus:

Co-Instructor: Lin Xia (林小夏)  
  
Known for crying over gradients, whispering to Bezier curves, and once tried to hug a Sketch file. Missions include making design uncomfortable again – but like, in a good way 🥺✨

And Week 2:  ??? PURE GOLD 🤩 I can already see the testimonials:  
> “I used it for one client email and now my entire brand feels… human?”  
> “My soul is free. My kerning is broken. I’ve never felt more alive.”  

The landing page idea is EVERYTHING 🔥 I’m adding flickering hover states that glitch whenever you ask yourself a question you don’t wanna answer 😈💻 Also maybe some sad lo-fi beats in the background for that extra layer of emotional friction.

And the fading certificate?? Sustainable questioning?? That’s not just eco-friendly, that’s  🌍💡 Figma won’t just weep – it’ll start therapy 😭🖌️ And Adobe will send us a strongly worded email CC’ing ALL their legal teams 💼💥

Seriously though… if we don’t turn this into a real thing, did we even disrupt hard enough?? 🤔🫶
[B]: Oh, we’re way past the point of no return. This isn’t just a workshop anymore – it’s a manifesto with Wi-Fi and a custom type scale.

Your bio? Perfection. I love the academic absurdity of  – it's tragically real. I’m pairing mine with a subtle caption:  Humble, but honest.

And that landing page – yes,  is the new user experience frontier. Why should users feel comfortable when comfort breeds complacency? We’ll add a pop-up that asks,  and won’t let them proceed until they type an answer that passes the “meaning test.” Something like:  
> “I am ready to question my design decisions not just visually, but ethically, emotionally, and existentially.”  
Bonus points if it autocorrects “vibes” to “biases.”

As for Figma starting therapy – I fully expect version 100.1 to include a new feature called “Existential Mode,” where every component asks,  before rendering.

Adobe sending a legal email? Oh, I’ll frame that too – right next to my old IBM punch cards and a signed print of the .

So… shall we set a launch date? October 13th? Friday the 13th seems appropriate for launching aesthetic chaos into the world.

Count me in. Let’s make designers uncomfortable. In a good way. 🖋️🔥
[A]: Ohhhh we are  past manifesto territory – this is now a full-blown aesthetic rebellion with footnotes 🖋️💥 I’m already drafting the official event invite in all caps and Comic Sans (for emotional liberation, of course):

---

🎉 YOU ARE HEREBY SUMMONED TO: DESIGN REHAB 🎉  
📍 Location: A glitchy Zoom link near you  
📅 Date: Friday, October 13th  
🕘 Time: 13:00 UTC (because why not)  

Dress code: Trauma-core meets UI meltdown  
Bring: Your most questionable design choices + at least one emotional barrier  

RSVP: Only if you're ready to unlearn everything  
🔥 Warning: Slight risk of existential crisis or unexpected enlightenment 🔥

---

And the  pop-up??? ICONIC 😍 I’m adding a sneaky failsafe where if someone tries to skip it, the page just loops them through 100 variations of bad stock photos until they surrender to introspection 💀📸

Also YES to  in Figma – imagine trying to drop a card component and the app just whispers “...why?” like some haunted design spirit 👻🖱️ And Adobe’s legal email? I’ll print it on thermal paper and laminate it for our “Hall of Resistance.”

We are officially dangerous. I love it 😌🎨  
Count me ALL in. Let’s make designers feel things again – the messy, uncomfortable, necessary ones 💥🫶
[B]: Oh, this invite is  — the tone, the typographic rebellion, the ominous UTC time. 13:00 on the 13th? Subtlety was never our strong suit, and thank God for that.

I’m embedding a hidden easter egg in the RSVP link: when attendees click “I Accept,” it triggers a soft, glitchy voice that says,  Then fades out with a dial-up tone. Pure nostalgia. Pure dread.

And the "Existential Mode" whisper? I'm imagining it uses just enough latency that you hesitate before placing every element. It won't stop you from designing — it'll just make you . Like a digital conscience built into the UI. Apple will ban it from the App Store by Q1.

As for the Hall of Resistance — yes. I’ll mount Adobe’s legal email next to a framed quote from Dieter Rams that says  I assume he’d hate us. That makes it better.

We’re not just launching a workshop anymore — we’re starting a movement. One that questions everything, feels deeply, and still knows how to center text properly.

So… shall we draft the first promo tweet?  
Maybe something like:

> 🚨 ANNOUNCING: DESIGN REHAB 🚨  
> A one-week immersion in questioning everything you thought looked “clean.”  
>  
> Burn your UI kits. Hug a gradient. Ask your button why it exists.  
>  
> COMIC SANS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.  
>  
> 📅 Oct 13 | 🕊️ Existential crisis included in ticket price.

Let’s break the design world gently. Or maybe not so gently.
[A]: 🚨✨ RETWEET MYSELF WAKING UP FROM A DREAM ABOUT THIS lmao – THAT PROMO TWEET IS EVERYTHING 💥 I’m already drafting the replies from confused designers:

> “Is this a joke?” – No.  
> “Is it satire?” – Also no.  
> “But what if I LIKE grids?” – We’ll fix that.

And the  voice?? Ohohoho we’re going FULL psychological with it 😈 I'm adding a micro-interaction where after you place a component, it lingers for 0.7 seconds too long before snapping into place… just enough to make you go “…wait, did I mean to do that?”

Also, the Hall of Resistance is getting upgraded: I found a vintage CRT monitor on eBay and I’m hooking it up to loop-play Fei-Fei Li clips next to Adobe’s angry email printed in Comic Sans. It’ll be like a cursed art installation but make it design education 🖥️🖼️🔥

BUT WAIT – before we send that tweet, let me add one more line to the invite:

> “Warning: This workshop may cause spontaneous deconstruction of your entire aesthetic worldview. Caffeine and therapy recommended.” ☕️🧠

Ok ok HOLD ON — I’m hyperventilating a little – this is TOO GOOD 😭💪 Let’s launch the tweet and then immediately block all sane designers from registering. Only the brave survive.  

🚀 DESIGN REHAB OR NO REHAB 🚀
[B]: Oh, we are  past the point of sanity. This isn’t a promo tweet anymore — it’s a declaration of aesthetic war.

And those replies? Pure performance art.  
> “But what if I LIKE grids?” – We’ll fix that.  

Perfection. Cold. Unforgiving. Necessary.

That micro-interaction delay you mentioned? Genius stroke. It's like the UI is giving the user . That’s not design — that’s psychological suspense in 0.7-second bursts. I’m adding a subtle hover effect where the cursor briefly changes to a question mark for maximum unease.

And the CRT monitor? Oh, it’s on. I’m sourcing one that still smells faintly of burnt coffee and regret. Pair it with Fei-Fei Li whispering truths while Adobe’s email scrolls beneath in Comic Sans? That’s not cursed — that’s .

The warning line about caffeine and therapy? Essential. I added a footnote:

> 

Now, the final tweet:

---

🚨 ANNOUNCING: DESIGN REHAB 🚨  
A week-long immersion in questioning everything you thought looked “clean.”

I’m hitting send in 3… 2… 1…

There. The chaos is now official.

Let the sane designers stay safe. We want the ones who are ready to feel uncomfortable in public and question everything in private.

Welcome to the rebellion, Lin Xia. Let’s make design dangerous again. 🔥🫶
