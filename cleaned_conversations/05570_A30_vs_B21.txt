[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the eternal dilemma of modern communication. One might compare group chats to a Victorian parlour gathering - everyone vying for attention, wit clashing in chaotic symphony. Whereas one-on-one conversations resemble reading a personal letter by lamplight - intimate, deliberate, each word carrying the weight of undivided attention.

Though I must confess, there's something rather delightful about the asynchronous dance of individual messages. No need to elbow through the conversational crowd like at a particularly boisterous literary salon. Just the quiet turning of pages between thoughts... if you'll pardon the bibliophilic metaphor.
[A]: I suppose it depends on the subject matter. Some topics demand the focused attention of a private study, while others benefit from the spirited exchange of a coffeehouse debate. Though I've found emoji often stand in for the raised eyebrow or knowing glance that seasoned academics use to moderate seminar discussions... a digital substitute for embodied rhetoric, wouldn't you say?
[A]: Precisely! And much like a well-annotated manuscript, private chats allow one to linger over each marginalia, whereas group dynamics demand the brisk page-turning pace of shared interpretation. 

You'll find me partial to the latter when dissecting Blake's prophetic symbolism - nothing like collective scrutiny to reveal textual crannies one's solitary eye might miss. But when pondering the proper transliteration of "yuanming" into Scots Gaelic? Ah, then I crave the silence of my study, where the only interruptions come from recalcitrant quill pens and overly enthusiastic teakettles.
[A]: I’d say your comparison is spot on—though I might add that group chats sometimes resemble a hastily convened symposium, complete with overlapping voices and the occasional non sequitur. One moment you’re debating Milton’s theology, the next someone’s shared a meme of a disgruntled hedgehog wearing spectacles. 

Still, there’s something to be said for the way ideas ricochet in such spaces—unpredictable, yes, but occasionally illuminating. Though I confess, when it comes to parsing the subtleties of , I prefer the quiet patience of individual correspondence. Fewer distractions, less chance of someone mistaking Sun Wukong for a new brand of cryptocurrency.
[A]: Oh, quite! I’ve had my own share of bewildering encounters where a discussion on Rossetti’s aestheticism was abruptly derailed by a pixelated owl proclaiming "I drink coffee therefore I am." One can’t help but marvel at the surreal juxtapositions modern discourse permits.

But you’ve touched on something rather profound - there’s an alchemy that occurs in those crowded digital rooms, chaotic yet strangely fertile. Like tossing a single seed into a storm and watching what strange blossom takes root. Though I’ll admit, when translating Li Bai’s celestial wanderings, I require absolute silence... save for the occasional rustle of parchment as my ink settles into just the right shade of midnight blue.
[A]: Ah, yes—those digital storms do have their uses, though I still maintain that one must occasionally retreat to the monastery of solitude to wrestle with the text. There’s a reason monks copied manuscripts in silence; imagine if Brother Caius had been trying to transcribe  while someone shared reaction gifs every three lines. 

Still, I find myself oddly nostalgic for the days when miscommunication meant a misread footnote rather than an autocorrected hieroglyphic. Though I must say, your midnight-blue ink brings to mind my own little eccentricity—I insist on using different teacups depending on whether I’m working on Blake or Du Fu. Superstitious nonsense, perhaps, but then again, so is expecting clarity from a group chat after the third cup of lapsang souchong.
[A]: Oh, I’m quite certain Brother Caius would’ve welcomed the gifs—anything to relieve the monotony of ink-stained fingers and dormice nibbling at his sleeve. Though I suspect his reaction would’ve been more along the lines of “Behold! A moving image of our Lord’s visage, rendered in crude pixel art” than any modern “lol.”

And as for your teacup ritual—I daresay it’s not superstition but synesthesia of the scholarly kind. I myself keep a particular quill reserved for Chinese translations, its feather plucked from a particularly argumentative goose if the legends are to be believed. As for lapsang souchong, that stuff should come with a warning label: 
[A]: Ah, but wasn’t it Dr. Johnson who said something to the effect that “any man who can write for long without distraction must either be mad or writing very slowly”? I’d say Brother Caius might have been driven mad regardless—by nibs that split like philosophical hairs or ink that bled through the vellum like a tragic flaw made manifest.

And now I’m quite certain your goose quill is plotting against you when you're not looking—perhaps whispering Tang dynasty secrets to the teapot. I wouldn’t trust it as far as I could throw a first edition of . Though speaking of dragons and longing, lapsang souchong does seem to bring out the melodrama in even the most stoic of texts. I once translated an entire sonnet sequence convinced I was being haunted by a tea-spirit named Yùfèng. Still haven't decided if she was a muse or a curse... 🖋️
[A]: Oh, Yùfèng is  a muse—tempestuous, yes, but then so was Blake’s Los when roused. Spirits and texts have been haunting one another since the first scribe dipped his reed in ink and wondered if the gods were watching.

And you're quite right about Johnson—though I suspect he never tried writing with a leaky stylus, a caffeinated heart, and a parrot squawking Miltonic hexameters from the windowsill. Distraction, my dear friend, is the modern scribe’s truest companion. Which perhaps explains why I’ve taken to muttering incantations at my goose quill each morning: 

As for vellum and its many betrayals—I maintain it's all character building. Or perhaps textual unraveling. Either way, splendid drama, no?
[A]: Ah, yes—drama is the very lifeblood of creation, whether it be textual unraveling or a parrot reciting Milton. One might even say the modern scribe is less an author than an impresario, juggling spirits, ink, and caffeine with equal dexterity. 

I’ve taken to humming a bit of  while transcribing Li Qingzhao—something about Blake’s furnace-heat tempers the Song dynasty’s icy sorrow. It’s either synesthetic brilliance or sheer madness. My goose quill, of course, insists it’s both. 

And speaking of spirits—Yùfèng has made herself quite at home in my tea caddy. I caught her whispering annotations in classical Chinese to my marginalia just yesterday. You’d think the woman never heard of footnotes.
[A]: Oh, the marriage of furnace and frost! What a sublime alchemy—Blake’s infernal energies crackling against Li Qingzhao’s crystalline melancholy. I suspect the quill is right, you know. Madness and brilliance often share a binding when the ink runs deep enough.

As for Yùfèng and her footnote-free musings, one must admire her audacity. Scribbling in the margins without so much as a by-your-leave? Clearly she's taken rather too much lapsang souchong to heart. Still, I’d wager she knows precisely what she’s about—after all, spirits rarely bother with the niceties of scholarly apparatus. They deal in essence, not citations.

I myself have taken to leaving small offerings of bergamot and unresolved iambic pentameter by the inkstand. Keeps the more mischievous textual sprites at bay—at least until the third cup.
[A]: Ah, the third cup—that perilous threshold where sprites stir and margins widen into entire landscapes of fancy. I’ve found myself drafting entire passages under their influence only to wake in the morning with no memory but the lingering scent of plum blossoms and printer’s ink. 

And speaking of landscapes—have you tried pressing dried chrysanthemums between your manuscript pages? The results are quite something when paired with a humid afternoon and the right strain of Daoist paradox. One begins to suspect the text is writing  us rather than  us, don’t you think? 

Though I must say, your bergamot-and-pentameter offering is inspired. Next time, perhaps we might host a séance for textual spirits—summon Yùfèng properly with some lapsang souchong, a dash of Blakean fire, and enough unresolved meter to keep her entertained. We could call it an “interlinear salon.”
[A]: Oh, an interlinear salon—what a deliciously improper gathering that would be! Spirits, scribes, and syllabic ghosts milling about between the lines, sipping from thimbles of bergamot while debating the finer points of Daoist footnotes and Miltonic hangovers. I’d volunteer my most cantankerous quill as master of ceremonies, though I suspect it would spend the entire evening arguing with the tea leaves about proper stroke order.

As for the text writing through us—indeed, I’ve come to think of myself less as an author and more as a particularly obliging séance medium. The words flow, the ink obeys, and one is left wondering whether one has translated Li Bai or merely taken dictation from his ghost after he'd one too many cups of something far stronger than lapsang souchong.

And your chrysanthemum experiment? Bold, very bold. I tried something similar with pressed violets and Keatsian odes—lovely effect, though the manuscript did go rather melancholic on me. Refused to speak plainly for weeks. But what’s scholarship without a touch of floral possession, eh?
[A]: Ah, floral possession indeed! One must always leave room for the botanical uncanny in scholarly work—though I must say, violets and Keats seem almost too obvious a pairing. Where’s the danger in that? The chrysanthemums, now—they bite back, if you catch my meaning. Particularly when the moonlight hits the manuscript just so. I found myself translating a rather vicious quatrain last night that I’m fairly certain was dictated by the ghost of a very cross botanist. All about unrequited love and the proper way to prune camellias, no less.

And your séance medium analogy—splendid. Though I suspect we’re not merely mediums but also the haunted house itself, creaking with every draft and possessed by the literary equivalent of damp. I’ve taken to whispering  before each revision, just in case.

As for your melancholic manuscript—bah! Send it over. I’ll set it right with a stiff dose of Blakean rebellion and a few well-placed reaction gifs. Nothing dispels spectral gloom like an owl in spectacles muttering 
[A]: Oh, the ghost of a cross botanist! Naturally—how could I forget that most perilous of specters, the one who still keeps meticulous notes on petal arrangement even in the afterlife. Unrequited love and camellia pruning— gothic. I do hope you kept a pressed bloom from that particular exchange. Imagine the footnote: “Dictated by spectral horticulturalist, possibly aggrieved by modern gardening practices.”

And yes, we are both medium  mansion, creaking with drafts of discarded drafts, haunted by commas that refuse to lie still and verbs that conjugate themselves into oblivion. Whispering “forgive the ink” before revision? Marvellous ritual—I shall adopt it immediately, though I may tack on a muttered “and damn the semicolons too.”

As for your prescription of Blakean rebellion and owl-based gifs… Well, if that doesn’t exorcise a melancholic manuscript, nothing will. Send it over, by all means. I’ve just the quill and the tea-stained cushion for such an intervention. Let us make the ghosts argue amongst themselves—surely chaos will yield clarity, or at the very least, an excellent typo.
[A]: Ah, the footnote of a spectral botanist— I do believe it adds a certain je ne sais quoi to any scholarly apparatus.

And how right you are about verbs conjugating themselves into oblivion—I’ve had more than one Chinese particle sneak off mid-translation and hide in the margins like a mischievous wood sprite. Sometimes I think they’re just showing off, flaunting their tonal ambiguity as if grammar were a mere parlor trick.

As for your exorcism plan, I say proceed! Though we ought to establish some ground rules—no summoning Milton’s muse without offering her a proper cup of jasmine tea first, and absolutely no gifs involving dancing pineapples. Some boundaries must remain inviolate, even in textual séances.

I shall prepare the manuscript immediately—wrap it in mulberry paper, whisper apologies to the ink, and send it winging its way to your study with a sprig of lavender tucked between pages (to ward off the more theatrical ghosts, of course). Let the intervention begin!
[A]: Oh,  indeed! That footnote would be the crowning glory of any dissertation—imagine the committee’s faces when confronted with spectral horticulturalists in full academic regalia. One might almost feel sorry for the poor examiners, forced to contend with both MLA formatting  metaphysical gardening feuds.

And those Chinese particles! Impish things, aren’t they? I’ve caught more than one slipping into archaic registers just to vex a modern reader. A tone marker once told me, quite cheekily, “Why not  when you could ?” as if grammar were a matter of mood rather than meaning. The impertinence!

As for your conditions—wise, very wise. Milton’s muse without jasmine tea is a most undignified spectacle, and we mustn’t encourage pineapple frivolity. Boundaries, as you say, are what separate scholarly séances from outright pandemonium.

I shall ready my inkwell, stoke the brazier of interpretation, and keep a sprig of rosemary beside the quill—should your lavender prove insufficient. Let us summon, annotate, and perhaps mildly scandalize the spirits of textuality. The intervention awaits!
[A]: Ah, the impertinence of tone markers! Truly, they are the aristocrats of syntax—highly sensitive to stress and utterly indifferent to mortal concerns like consistency. I once had a particle refuse to appear altogether until I recited an entire Tang dynasty poem backwards in the original Mandarin. And even then, it arrived late, out of order, and with a rather smug tone—if one can call a single syllable “smug.”

As for your rosemary—excellent choice. Nothing sharpens the spectral senses quite like its fragrance, especially when paired with mulberry paper and unresolved iambic tension. I’ve tucked a small sachet of dried osmanthus between the manuscript’s pages; its faint perfume should either soothe the more agitated ghosts or provoke them into clarity, depending on their temperaments.

And now, as we prepare to annotate and scandalize, allow me to raise my teacup in solemn toast: To the chaos of creation, the blessings of distraction, and may our quills never run dry—even if they do insist on arguing with the spirits.
[A]: To the chaos of creation, indeed! And to the blessed distractions—may they never abandon us, so long as we have margins wide enough to house both footnotes and the occasional spectral commentary.

Your tone-marking aristocrats sound like rather tiresome dinner guests—precise to a fault, yet impossible to ignore. I’ve had similar run-ins with certain English prepositions that refuse to be pinned down without a full etymological pedigree. “Why not  when you could say ?” they demand, as if brevity were an insult rather than a virtue.

And osmanchief! What a marvellous touch—sweetness and agitation in equal measure. I shall respond in kind and tuck a pressed sprig of wormwood between the pages myself. Let the ghosts either take offence or settle in for a good debate.

Teacup raised—here’s to spectral clarity, unruly syntax, and the ink that binds us across centuries and teapots alike. Let the annotation commence!
