[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，你提到space news我真的超级excited！最近那个NASA的James Webb Space Telescope发布的照片简直太🔥了吧？每次看到那些stars的图片我都忍不住说Wow✨！还有那个starlink的卫星发射，Elon Musk真的一直在push太空探索的边界呢~你觉得哪个部分最吸引你？我个人超爱看那些宇宙深空的影像，感觉整个人都被震撼到了💯！
[A]: OMG totally! The JWST pics gave me SERIOUS goosebumps😂 Like seriously, how does it even capture that level of detail?? I screenshot every single photo they release and save them as my phone wallpapers~ And Starlink?? Elon’s basically building a sci-fi future right in front of us👀 Did you see the latest rocket landing footage? So. Freaking. Smooth💯✨ Which part do I love most? Probably the way stars twinkle in those shots lol cheesy but true! Have you been keeping up with any other space updates? 🚀
[B]: OMG I’m so glad you get it!! 🤭 The way JWST zooms into those galaxies just makes my brain go ?? Like how is that even possible in 2023??? And same with the Starlink landings—those rockets landing like it’s NBD😂 I legit rewatch the clips every week and still geek out!!! 💫  
Oh my godddd have you checked out the new Artemis updates? NASA’s planning to send humans back to the Moon soon, not just for a visit but like…building bases eventually👀✨ It feels like we’re living in a futuristic movie right now omg😱  
And okay, this might sound a bit random, but I’ve also been obsessed with these asteroid mining concepts lately💸🚀 I know it sounds sci-fi, but companies are actually investing real $$$ into it😳 Have you heard anything about that??
[A]: OMG SAME!!! JWST literally broke my brain too😂 Like are we sure this isn’t CGI?? And Starlink landings? They’re so smooth it’s starting to feel like basic tech lol but NO IT’S NOT BASIC WE’RE JUST BEING FAKE-COOL 😂💫  

Artemis updates tho??? I KNOW RIGHT?! Going back to the moon and building bases?? That’s straight outta a sci-fi plot👀🔥 Can you imagine being one of those astronauts like “yea I’mma go set up shop on the Moon today” 🤯 I need that kind of life lol!  

And no, your asteroid mining obsession is 100% valid!! I’ve been watching sooo many videos about it💸🚀 It’s wild how real companies are taking it seriously now—like space gold rush vibes💯 I mean, if they pull it off, Earth’s economy might go 😳 What kind of asteroids or tech are you most curious about?? I’ve been geeking out over nickel-iron ones rn✨
[B]: OMG I LOVE that we’re vibing on the same space wavelength💯✨ Nickel-iron asteroids?? Yes yes yes!! They’re like the 💰 jackpot of space mining 😍🪐  
But me? I’ve been super curious about those carbonaceous ones… aka the ones full of organic materials and water! Like, imagine if we could literally harvest H2O from space rocks😳💧 That’s next-level stuff right there omg🔥  
And okay, don’t even get me started on the tech—robot swarms, autonomous drones mining in zero-g?? My brain goes into overdrive every time I think about it😂🤯 Have you seen how tiny some of these prototype robots are?? So cute but also so futuristic ahhh~  
Btw, do you ever daydream about working in space someday?? Like, would you live on a space station or nah?? 🌌👀
[A]: OMG YES THE CARBONACEOUS ONES THO?? 🤯💧 Harvesting WATER from space rocks?? That’s not just next-level, that’s like… GAME-CHANGING LEVEL😂 I mean, water in space = drinkable water + oxygen + rocket fuel?? We’re talking about SPACE GAS STATIONS lol💯🪐  

And robot swarms??? AHHH I die every time I see those lil’ drones working together in zero-g✨ They’re like tiny metal ants building stuff in space😂 I legit spent an hour watching a video about this one robotic arm that can 3D print tools in orbit—HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE??🔥  

And girl YES I DAYDREAM ABOUT LIVING IN SPACE ALL THE TIME👀🌌 I’d 100% live on a space station for like… a month? Maybe more?? Imagine waking up and seeing Earth every morning?? No filter needed omg📸💙 Would you actually go for it tho?? Or would you rather stay planet-side but still geek out over the tech like me?? 😂💫
[B]: OMG YOU’RE LIVING IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW😂🪐 Space gas stations is 100% the vibe—like fuelling up between Mars and Jupiter?? Iconic. 💯 And yes yes YES to the view from a space station 💙 I’d literally never stop taking pics, my phone gallery would be 90% Earth selfies from space 😂📸  
Would I go for it tho?? BABY GIRL I’M 70% ready 🚀👀 I mean… if they have good Wi-Fi and I can stream Netflix while floating around? Sign me up✨ But like… what about you? Would you actually pack your bags right now or nah?? 😏  
Alsoaaa random but… have you been keeping up with all that SpaceX stuff?? Elon’s team is basically building the future one rocket at a time🔥💯
[A]: OH MY GOD 70% READY?? SAME HERE!!! 🚀👀 And yes, I need that Wi-Fi in space too lol—can’t survive without K-dramas and TikTok trends😂 Streaming Netflix while floating? That’s the ULTIMATE flex tbh✨  

Would I pack my bags rn?? UMMM… 80% YES LOL 😏 I’d just need a lil’ time to say goodbye to my doggo and grab my fave skincare products🪐💦 But if they told me “space shuttle leaves tomorrow,” I’d be like…  LET’S DO IT 💯  

And OMG DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON SPACEX🔥🔥 Their Starship updates are LIT asf!! Did you see the latest test flight?? It’s like watching a sci-fi movie unfold in real-time🌌💥 Also lowkey obsessed with how they’re reusing boosters now—it’s basically eco-friendly space tech, no cap💯  
Elon & his squad are out here building the future and it’s sooo exciting omg😍 Have you been watching all the launches live?? I literally set reminders for every SpaceX update😂🪶
[B]: OKAY 80% YES??? GURL YOU’VE GOT THE SPACE SPIRIT FOR SURE💯🪐 Setting reminders for SpaceX updates?? SAME HERE LOL😂 I literally have a whole playlist of launch highlights on YouTube and I add new ones every week—so extra but so me✨  

And yes yes YES to the Starship test flights🔥👀 It’s like, every time they do one, my heart’s like DDDRRRRRRRRRAAAAMMMMATIC BEAT 😂🚀 And omg the way they land those boosters?? So smooth it’s scary—like no big deal, just casually landing rockets vertically in 2023?? PLS 🙄💫  

And helloooo eco-friendly space tech?? YES PLEASE & THANK U! Like, we’re saving Earth while getting ready to explore other planets?? That’s called doing it all babes💯🌍🪐  

Btw… if you  to choose right now, would you rather go to the ISS or take a quick trip around the Moon?? 🤔✨ Cuz honestly? I’m torn between floating above Earth or seeing its pretty face from space 😍📸
[A]: OMG SAME HERE WITH THE LAUNCH PLAYLIST?? I’VE GOT A SPOTIFY ONE TOO😂🪐 Cuz obviously space launches need their own hype soundtrack lol✨  

And yes, Starship test flights = pure adrenaline shots to the heart🔥👀 Every time that countdown starts I’m like “BREATHE. THIS IS HISTORY.” And those booster landings?? I legit gasp every single time—like y’all just casually landing rockets like it’s 2003 or something??? PLS 😂💯  

And ISS vs MOON TRIP?? HELLO THAT’S SUCH A TOUGHIE 🤯🌝 But if I HAD to choose… I’d say MOON!! Like imagine seeing Earth from lunar orbit?? Just floating there, no filters, no borders, just  view… I’d be done. Emotional overload📸💖  
But hey, would you actually go for the Moon trip even if it’s like… a 7-day thing?? Or would you rather live on the ISS longer? 😏🚀
[B]: OMG A SPACE PLAYLIST ON SPOTIFY??? 🤭💯 I need your link pls & thank u—obvi we’re soul sisters from another planet lol😂🪐  
And yes yes YES to the emotional overload✨📸 Floating in lunar orbit staring at Earth?? That’s literally the type of view that makes you rethink life, like… who needs therapy when you have space views am I right?? 😌🌌  

As for me? I’d still pick ISS if I had to choose 😏👀 Cuz hellooo, floating around for days, doing science-y things (or pretending to), and getting that 16 sunrises a day?? ICONIC. I’d be out here vibing with the Earth views  pretending I’m some kinda astronaut rockstar 💫🎸  
But okay fine, if they let me take a mini moonwalk while I’m there?? Then maybe I’d switch sides😈🌝 How many days do they even give you for those trips rn?? 7 days is cute but I want MORE✨🔥
[A]: OMG I’ll send you the link ASAP—track 1 is always a launch countdown with dramatic synth music😂🪐 We  space soul sisters tbh, no cap 💯  

And YES TO THE THERAPY VIBES FROM SPACE!! 🤯✨ Who needs a therapist when you can just float by the Cupola and watch Earth do its thing?? No stress, no noise, just pure cosmic zen😌🌌  

ISS FOR THE WIN THO!!! 16 SUNRISES A DAY?? That’s basically space EDM vibes on repeat🎸💫 And pretending to do science? The most relatable flex lol 😂 But wait… mini moonwalk tho??? HELLO that’s cheating! Of course you’d switch sides with a moonwalk😈🌝  
As for trip length rn? I think the current Moon missions are like… 7-10 days?? Not enough!!! I’d need at least a month up there📸🔥 Would you go for a longer stay if they offered it?? Like… a full space glow-up experience?? 😏🪐
[B]: OMG SEND THAT LINK BEFORE I ASCEND TO THE MOON WITHOUT YOU😂🪐 Countdown + synth music?? That’s peak spacecore aesthetic tbh✨🔥  

And yes yes YES to the cosmic zen 🤭💫 Floating by the Cupola like “I’m emotionally stable now, Earth can chill” 😌💯 Totally relatable.
