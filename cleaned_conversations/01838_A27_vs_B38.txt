[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a nuanced question, isn't it? Let me think... In many ways, a college degree still carries considerable weight, particularly in fields like law, medicine, or academia. It’s often the key that unlocks certain professional doors. But—and this is a substantial —I’ve noticed a growing shift. With the rise of specialized certifications, online learning platforms, and a greater emphasis on skills over credentials, the monopoly of the degree seems to be loosening, especially in creative or tech-driven industries.

Still, there’s more to university than just the piece of paper. The critical thinking, exposure to diverse ideas, and the cultivation of intellectual resilience—those are enduring assets. Would you say your own perspective aligns, or do you see it differently?
[A]: Hmm🤔 I totally get what you're saying, and honestly? 我觉得it’s kinda like a double-edged sword, you know？On one hand，像你说的，有些field比如medicine or engineering，那个degree真的是敲门砖，没它真的很难进。But then again，现在好多startup公司或者creative industry，他们更care你有没有real skill，有没有portfolio，而不是你毕业于哪所学校～

而且说实话，我身边很多朋友都开始走alternative路线了，like taking coding bootcamps，或者做freelance projects积累经验。感觉degrees sometimes更像是个“保险选项”，but not necessarily the only path to success 💯 

我自己嘛…其实也有点纠结😅 因为我也在想：如果我真的去读大学，会不会四年之后反而错过了很多可以直接入行的机会？但另一方面，有个degree好像也挺安心的，就像个back-up plan？你有类似的朋友吗？还是说你觉得应该直接冲？🚀
[B]: That’s a remarkably perceptive way to frame it—as a . I couldn’t agree more. You know, I had a former student—bright, inquisitive—who faced that very dilemma. She was torn between enrolling in a traditional design program or jumping straight into freelance work with a local creative studio that had shown interest in her portfolio.

What she ended up doing was rather clever—she enrolled part-time in a liberal arts degree while building her design portfolio on the side. It gave her the intellectual grounding she craved and the flexibility to pursue her passion. In a sense, she hedged her bets. And honestly? That hybrid approach seems to be gaining traction among young thinkers like yourself.

As for your own path—I imagine you’re someone who values both structure and creativity. Have you considered how certain disciplines, say, philosophy or literature, might complement your practical pursuits? A well-read mind often brings unexpected insight, even in tech or startups. But of course, that’s just my academic bias showing 😊

Still, I admire your willingness to question the conventional route. It shows a rare kind of self-awareness. Have you spoken to any mentors about this? Or is it something you’re still quietly mulling over?
[A]: Ohhhh我超喜欢你提到的这个hybrid approach的概念✨！感觉就像是既能keep那个option open，又不会完全放弃自己真正想做的东西～而且你说的那个学生真的好smart啊，like seriously，两边都兼顾到了！

其实我最近也在想类似的事情诶🤔 因为虽然我喜欢拍video、做content创作，但我也知道pure creativity有时候会遇到瓶颈，比如不知道怎么把一个idea深化，或者怎么让内容更有depth。那时候我就觉得，maybe学点像philosophy或literature这种“看似没用但其实很deep”的东西，反而会让我的创作更有层次感诶～

不过嘛…我还是有点担心时间分配的问题😅 榜样有了，但执行起来真的能做到吗？毕竟一边上学一边搞portfolio真的很challenging。而且说实话，我现在还没找到一个really靠谱的mentor来聊这些，身边的朋友也都是各忙各的，很少有人认真讨论future path的问题。

所以…你是怎么看待现在越来越多人选择走这种非传统的路的呢？你有没有遇过那种“读了四年结果发现完全不适合自己”的学生？😳
[B]: Ah, now  the million-dollar question, isn’t it? I’ve seen it more times than I can count—students who arrive full of ambition, only to realize by their third year that the path they chose no longer suits them. Some find their way through it, others... not so much. And yes, a few have come back to me saying,  or even 

But here’s what I do believe—and this may sound a bit idealistic—the journey itself matters. Even if someone ends up diverging from their original plan, those four years often shape them in ways they didn’t anticipate. A literature class might spark an unexpected love for narrative structure, which later becomes invaluable in storytelling for film or advertising. A philosophy seminar might teach clarity of thought that sharpens one’s editorial voice.

As for the hybrid model you mentioned—it’s not easy, that’s true. But I’ve noticed something fascinating: when students pursue something creative  their formal studies, rather than , they tend to emerge with a richer perspective. It’s not about doing twice as much—it’s about weaving threads together into something uniquely textured.

And about mentors—well, sometimes we find them in books, in lectures, even in random conversations. If I may offer a suggestion without overstepping, perhaps start with questions. Ask people whose work you admire—even if it’s just over email or social media. You’d be surprised how many professionals are open to a thoughtful inquiry. After all, curiosity is the beginning of any great intellectual adventure 📚✨

So tell me—what kind of stories do you want to tell through your content? Because I suspect that will guide your next step more than any syllabus ever could.
[A]: OMG totally agree with you about the journey itself being valuable even if things don’t go as planned 🤯！我之前真的没从这个角度想过…like sometimes我们以为的“浪费时间”，说不定later on反而会成为独特的优势！

说实话我现在特别confused but also super curious…因为我发现我自己拍video的时候，真的超爱讲那种有深度的小故事，不是单纯搞笑或者炫酷的视觉效果。比如前两天我就拍了个关于city life中陌生人之间connection的短片，用了很多隐喻和slow-motion镜头，结果出乎意料地火了🔥

所以你说的对，maybe我真的应该先想清楚自己到底想表达什么，而不是先想着“该不该去读大学”😅 因为内容创作这行吧，真的太容易变得surface-level了，我不想只是蹭热点，我想build something meaningful～

话说回来，你刚刚说的那个“ask people whose work you admire”…我真的可以试试诶！其实我一直有点小偶像，比如某些独立导演 or digital artists，但我从来没敢私信他们问问题🤔 你觉得我应该怎么开口才不会显得很stalker吗？😂
[B]: Oh, I love that you’re thinking this way—it’s the difference between  content and  it with intention. That short film you described sounds like a lovely example of the latter. There’s something quite poetic about finding meaning in fleeting human connections—very modern, yet deeply timeless. You’re already thinking like someone who understands narrative depth, whether you intended to or not.

As for reaching out to creators you admire—yes, absolutely, you should try! The key is to approach with sincerity and specificity. Don’t send a generic —that gets lost in the noise. Instead, mention a particular moment in their work that resonated with you. Something like:

> “Hi [Name],  
I’ve been following your visual essays on urban solitude, and I especially loved the way you used slow-motion in  to highlight those quiet, unnoticed moments. It reminded me of something I tried recently in my own work, and I’d be curious to hear how you approached the emotional tone while editing.”

That kind of message shows you’ve engaged thoughtfully—and people remember that. Most artists, especially independent ones, appreciate genuine dialogue. And even if they don’t reply, the act of articulating your admiration clearly helps sharpen your own creative instincts.

You’re not a stalker—you’re a fellow storyteller looking for guidance. And there’s nothing more human than that 😊

So tell me, have you started sketching out any new concepts lately? Or is there a theme you keep circling back to, almost without realizing it?
[A]: OMG thank you so much for helping me frame that message! 🤩 我从来没想过可以这样写，感觉一下子就有重点又不会太random了～真的超有用！💯

Actually yeah, I’ve been scribbling some ideas in my notebook最近脑子里一直有个theme在绕来绕去…有点像“数字时代的孤独感”？Like how we’re  connected online but still feel kinda…disconnected? 我自己也每天刷手机刷到有点麻木，但又不敢停，怕错过什么🔥

所以我拍了一个conceptual的小短片草稿，用了很多glitch effects和voiceover，想表达那种“在线上世界扮演理想人设”的矛盾感。But honestly，我现在还不敢发，因为有点担心大家看不懂 or 觉得太抽象😂

你有没有看过类似风格的video？或者你觉得这种内容在现在的平台上会不会太“慢热”了？我真的很想做有深度的东西，但也不想完全失去audience的共鸣…有点纠结🥺
[B]: Oh, that theme——it’s one of the most compelling (and underexplored) emotional landscapes of our time. You’re tapping into something profoundly modern, yet deeply human. It reminds me a bit of those early 20th-century writers who were grappling with industrialization and alienation—Proust’s sense of longing, Kafka’s estrangement—but now refracted through screens and Wi-Fi signals 🌐

And I love that you're using glitch effects and voiceover—it feels like the right visual metaphor for inner fragmentation and digital dissonance. As for worrying whether people will “get it”—yes, it can be risky on platforms that favor instant engagement. But here’s what I’ve noticed: , even if it takes a moment to settle in.

Think of it this way—you’re not just speaking  an audience, you’re quietly inviting them into a mood, a reflection. And not everyone will step inside, of course. But those who do? They’ll feel seen in a way that algorithmic content rarely allows.

I’d say go ahead and share it. Maybe add a short caption—not an explanation, but a kind of poetic prompt. Something like:

> “We scroll to connect… but sometimes it feels like we’re rehearsing a version of ourselves no one really knows.”

Let the audience meet the piece halfway. Trust me, they’ll appreciate being trusted with meaning-making.

And if it doesn’t go viral right away? That’s okay. Some ideas simmer before they spark 🔥

So tell me—did any particular moment or experience inspire that theme for you? I’m always curious about where artistic instincts come from.
[A]: OMG你居然提到Proust和Kafka我还以为只有我会这样想😂！！但你说得太对了，真的就是那种“modern版的alienation”！我之前有次半夜刷TikTok刷到自己都分不清我是真的在跟人connect还是只是在scrolling，那种感觉超诡异…like my thumb kept moving but我的脑子已经麻木了🤯

然后我就突然想到：我们每天都在用各种app表达自己，但那个“自己”真的是我们吗？还是只是我们想让别人看到的样子？于是我就开始构思那个video里的主角——她一直在发perfectly curated的vlog片段，但real life里却越来越empty😭

不过听你这么一说我现在反而更confident了！maybe我真的不需要太担心大家会不会看不懂，而是应该相信他们会用自己的方式去interpret。而且说实话，我已经有点tired of chasing trends anyway，我真的想做点能留下来的东西～

诶对了，你觉得像这种比较conceptual的内容，适合放在什么platform上会更好呢？Instagram Reels好像节奏太快了，YouTube Shorts又太算法导向…我在想有没有哪里可以既保留深度又不至于被淹没😭
[B]: Oh, now  the dilemma of our era—aren’t we all caught somewhere between wanting to be seen and wanting to say something that lasts? 🤔

Let me offer a thought: platforms like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts are built for speed, yes, and they favor content that lands quickly, rewards familiarity, and thrives on repetition. But what you're making—what you're  to make—is reflective, layered, even unsettling in the best sense. It doesn’t fit neatly into those formats because it asks the viewer to pause, to lean in, to sit with discomfort for a moment.

So here’s where I’d look instead:

Have you considered Vimeo? It’s become a kind of haven for artists who value atmosphere over analytics. The audience tends to be more patient, more willing to sit with ambiguity. Or perhaps Letterboxd, believe it or not—it’s not just for film reviews. A lot of visual storytellers are starting to share experimental shorts there, and the commentary is often rich and thoughtful.

Or—if you’re feeling bold—you could try building a small, intentional community around your work on Substack or Patreon. Not necessarily monetizing right away, but creating a space where people come specifically to engage with ideas rather than just consume content. You'd be surprised how many viewers are hungry for something slower, stranger, .

And if you ever feel tempted to chase trends again—and trust me, we all do—I have a little phrase I whisper to myself before hitting “publish”:

> “Would this still matter if no one saw it tonight?” 🌙

If the answer is yes… then you’ve already won.

So tell me—have you started giving your little protagonist a name yet? Or does she remain unnamed, like a modern-day cipher?
[A]: OMG我真的好喜欢你这个“Would this still matter if no one saw it tonight?”的问题啊！！😭 这句话简直…像一记耳光把我打醒的感觉😂

其实我之前真的没想过要给那个主角名字…但现在听你这么一说，感觉她好像就该是nameless的诶，像是一个mirror，让每个观众都能在她身上看到自己的一点影子？✨

而且你说的Vimeo和Letterboxd我真的要去试试看！我之前一直卡死在TikTok/IG这些快节奏平台里，好像忘了还有别的space可以让我慢慢呼吸～Maybe我真的不需要逼自己去follow algorithm的游戏规则，而是找到属于自己的小宇宙💫

话说…你有没有看过什么让你印象特别深刻的experimental short film？我想去看看一些参考作品，但又怕被别人影响太多🥲 你有推荐的吗？或者你会不会觉得我这样纠结的创作者都很…嗯，self-conscious？😅
[B]: Oh, that self-consciousness? It’s not a weakness—it’s the mark of an artist who cares deeply about , not just visibility. And honestly, I’d be more concerned if you  wrestling with influence right now. Every thoughtful creator does. The key is not to imitate, but to  with what moves you—to let it stir something in your own voice rather than silence it.

As for films that might speak to where you are creatively—let me suggest a few that linger in the space between abstraction and intimacy:

- “Wasp” by Andrea Arnold – raw, poetic, and quietly devastating. It plays with realism but has the texture of memory.
- “It’s Not Where You Think” by David Lowery – a meditation on time, place, and identity, told through fractured visuals and quiet narration.
- “The Polish Suicide Trilogy” by Mike Staks – hauntingly minimalist, these shorts use repetition and stillness to explore interior states.
- “I Am China” by Xiaolu Guo – not a short film per se, but many of her visual experiments have been adapted into screenings that pair text, music, and fragmented imagery to evoke dislocation and longing.

And of course, there’s always the work of Chantal Akerman, especially —a radical exploration of solitude, language, and the body. Her pacing is glacial, but beneath it burns a deep emotional current.

You don’t have to watch them all at once. Dip in when you’re feeling stuck or restless. Let them haunt you a little—but don’t let them define your direction. That’s still yours to shape.

So tell me—what’s the working title of your piece? Or is it untitled, like a poem waiting for its first line? 🌿
[A]: OMG这些推荐真的太及时了！！我最近正好在找一些能“对话”而不是直接模仿的作品😂 而且你说的对，我真的不需要急着被定义，反而应该让这些作品在我脑子里发酵一下，再慢慢变成我自己的东西✨

至于title嘛……我之前一直叫它《#GhostingReality》🤔 有点点网络感，但又带点讽刺，像是我们都在用hashtag表达自己，但背后的真实情绪却越来越难被看到……

不过听你提到poem之后，我觉得也许我可以写一小段text来配合video发布，不解释内容，而是像一个引子一样，让观众自己去联想～啊啊啊现在脑子里好多灵感在冒泡，感觉又要熬夜剪片了😂

话说……你有没有也偷偷拍过什么“非学术向”的影像作品？还是说你只停留在欣赏阶段？🙈 我超好奇你会不会也想尝试创作！
[B]: Oh, you’re  perceptive, aren’t you? 🤭

Well… let’s just say I’ve dabbled. Quietly. Unofficially. Think of it as a private extension of my teaching—using visual language to explore literary ideas in a different medium.

I once made a small experimental piece inspired by Virginia Woolf’s . No actors, just layered voiceovers, flickering candlelight, and close-ups of hands writing. It was never meant for an audience—it was more like thinking out loud, visually. But when I showed it to a few students in a seminar, one of them told me it felt like “reading a novel with your eyes.” That stayed with me.

And yes, I still keep a little folder labeled  on my desktop 😄—half-formed ideas based on everything from ancient Greek tragedy to modern digital alienation. One day, maybe when the semester ends and I have a rare quiet summer, I’ll actually make one.

Until then, I live vicariously through brilliant minds like yours. And honestly? I can already tell your  is going to haunt people in the best way.

So don’t forget to rest before that editing marathon! Even philosophers—and film-makers-in-the-making—need their solitude and sleep. 🌙✨
[A]: OMG你居然用视觉语言去表达伍尔夫的作品这也太文艺了我直接尖叫！！🤯🤯🤯 本来就超意识流，你还用voiceover + candlelight去recreate那种流动的感觉……我真的好想看看啊！！求求你哪天一定要发出来好不好？！

而且你说的对，创作真的不需要急着被所有人看到，有时候just a few right people就够了，对吧？像你那个学生说的“用眼睛读小说”——这也太美的形容了吧💯✨

好啦我记住了，拍完剪完我会好好休息的（虽然以我拖延症的程度可能要先刷半小时猫视频才能开工😂）…但总之谢谢你一直这样支持我的脑洞！感觉跟你聊完后我真的从纠结模式变成了创作模式了耶～

等我video出来第一时间@你哈！！不过在那之前…你暑假要是真动手拍了什么“Unmade Films”，也记得告诉我好吗？我已经准备好当你的头号影迷了🌝🎥
[B]: Oh, I  that you’d even want to watch it—well, let’s just say that if I ever do dust off that old Woolf-inspired piece, I’ll screen it for you personally. Maybe with tea, candlelight, and absolutely no algorithm lurking in the background 🕯️🍵

And as for your —I’ll be watching, I’ll be listening, and yes, I’ll probably rewatch it a few times just to catch all the layers. You’ve got something rare: an instinct for emotional texture. Don’t let anyone dull that edge.

And summer? Well, let’s just say my “Unmade Films” folder is still whispering… we’ll see who wins the battle of procrastination 😄

Now go on—go make something quietly extraordinary. And when you’re ready to rest, rest well. Even the most restless minds deserve stillness now and then.

🌙🎬✨
[A]: OMG我真的已经想象到那个screening的场景了😂 茶香+烛光+没有算法打扰的纯粹影像…这也太dreamy了吧！！我已经迫不及待想看你真的动手拍出来了哈哈～

而我这边也先许个愿：等我的video做完，一定要配上你最爱的Virginia Woolf式旁白，咱俩直接搞个“文学与影像的深夜对谈”好吗？✨

好啦不啰嗦啦～我现在要关掉手机、点上香薰、戴上耳机，正式开启我的创作模式了🔥（嗯……当然，之前可能还是得先刷十分钟猫视频冷静一下😂）

保持联系哈～有新动态一定第一时间找你！💌💫
[B]: Oh, I  that vision—literally and literarily. A midnight conversation between literature and lens? Sounds like the most delightful kind of intellectual trespassing 🌙📸

And your plan? Perfection. The薰香, the headphones, the pre-work procrastination ritual—it’s all part of the process. Even Woolf had her walking breaks and letter-writing diversions. Creativity needs its little superstitions.

So go on then—step into your world. And when you emerge, I’ll be here, ready to listen, to reflect, and yes—to light another imaginary candle for whatever comes next.

Keep dreaming, keep making, and above all—keep sharing those sparks. You’re doing something beautiful, even if it doesn’t feel like it in the moment.

Now… break a leg, Director Whitmore-in-spirit 🎬🌹  
I can’t wait to see what you bring to life.
