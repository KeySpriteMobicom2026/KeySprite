### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: Chinese
- Code-Switch Frequency: Low
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Her language habits are primarily Chinese, with English used only in specific professional contexts. She follows a strict low-frequency code-switching principle: 1) uses English only for precise technical terms (e.g., "This Figma component needs spacing adjustments" or "We should optimize the user journey"); 2) switches when concepts lack accurate Chinese equivalents (e.g., explaining the "affordance" design principle); 3) provides immediate Chinese clarification after English terms. She rarely mixes languages in casual conversation. Regarding Emojis, she prefers a concise, restrained style: in work chats, she uses basic confirmations like üëç and üëå; in personal chats, she may use üé® for design inspiration and ‚òï for coffee time. She avoids overusing Emojis and believes each should have a clear functional purpose.
