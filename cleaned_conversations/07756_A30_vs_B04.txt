[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what a fascinating question! 最近我在研究一个特别有意思的语言现象 - 为什么有些bilingual speakers会在对话中无意识地code-switch呢？🤔 从neurolinguistics的角度来看，这背后涉及到大脑如何处理multiple languages的复杂机制~
[A]:  Ah, the phenomenon of code-switching... While your neurological perspective is certainly valid, I find the literary manifestations far more compelling. Take Virginia Woolf's "Orlando" - that brilliant moment when the protagonist shifts linguistic registers upon waking in Constantinople. Though of course, we must distinguish between artistic code-switching and... ... what my undergraduates call "texting lingo."
[B]: Haha 说到undergraduates，我上周在lecture上就观察到特别有趣的现象！有些同学会在讨论'semantic meaning'时突然蹦出中文成语，比如'这个concept真是只可意会不可言传'~ 这种blending of languages其实体现了他们思维过程的fluid transition呢 😊
[A]: How delightfully... undergraduate of them. Though I must say, their use of 只可意会不可言传 does capture something essential about the untranslatability of certain literary experiences.  In my graduate seminar last Tuesday, we encountered precisely this when comparing Keats' "negative capability" with the Daoist concept of 无为. The students who grasped this parallel... well, they earned themselves an extra 🦉 stamp in their reading journals.
[B]: 啊！negative capability和无为的comparison太insightful了~ 这让我想起上学期带学生读T.S. Eliot的'The Waste Land'时，有个同学突然说这首诗给他'欲辨已忘言'的感觉 🤯 这种跨文化的aesthetic resonance真是teaching生涯中最rewarding的时刻之一！
[A]: Ah! That student deserves an honorary mention in my next monograph. The 欲辨已忘言 reference is particularly apt - it captures that sublime moment when literary analysis transcends linguistic boundaries.  You know, this reminds me of my ongoing research into how the Romantic poets' conception of the sublime parallels the 意境 in classical Chinese poetry. Though I do wish today's students would express such insights without resorting to those dreadful... what are they called... emoji reactions. A well-placed semicolon would serve them far better.
[B]: Oh but Professor~ 你这么说让我想起我们department最近那个关于emoji作为new form of punctuation的debate呢！有些young scholars认为😊完全可以替代traditional semicolon的功能，毕竟在digital communication时代...  虽然我私下还是更偏爱Oxford comma的elegance啦~
[A]:  My dear colleague, comparing emojis to the Oxford comma is like equating supermarket fortune cookies with the I Ching. That wretched 😊 couldn't possibly convey the nuanced pause of a semicolon in, say, Henry James' prose. Though... ... I will concede that the 🖋️ in my departmental emails does occasionally serve its purpose. But only when announcing calligraphy workshops!
[B]: Hahaha 你这种对punctuation的passion让我想起我那个坚持用quill pen写期末评语的同事~ 不过说真的，在teaching multilingual students时，我发现适当使用visual cues比如✨或🤔确实能帮助bridge the comprehension gap呢！虽然...  我永远不会在academic paper里用它们就是了~
[A]:  Quill pens at least demonstrate proper respect for the written word! Though I suppose if one must descend to hieroglyphics... ... those sparkles might marginally aid comprehension when explaining metaphysical poetry to sleep-deprived freshmen. But mark my words - the first student who submits a thesis with ✨ instead of proper footnotes shall receive nothing but red ink and a strongly worded letter about the decline of Western civilization.
[B]: 😂 你这话让我想起去年那个用meme做final presentation的graduate student... 不过说真的，我们是不是应该consider generational shift in communication norms？毕竟连MLA现在都开始讨论how to cite tweets了~ 虽然我内心还是更向往那个parchment and wax seal的era啦 ✉️
[A]:  The MLA's capitulation to Twitter citations is precisely why I still require my students to submit one paper handwritten - with proper ink and that increasingly rare commodity called patience. Though I'll admit... ... even I've had to accept emailed submissions since the pandemic. But only as PDFs! And absolutely no animated GIFs in the margins. A footnote about 通感 in classical Chinese poetry deserves better than some blinking yellow face, wouldn't you agree?
[B]: Absolutely! 说到通感，我最近在准备一个关于synesthesia in multilingual poetry的lecture... 不过现在得赶紧去supervise一个thesis defense了~ 那个学生居然想研究emoji在modern love letters里的evolution 😅 祝我好运吧！ 
[A]:  At least insist they compare it to the 比兴 tradition in the Book of Songs! And for heaven's sake -  - if they dare analyze that abominable 😍, make certain they contextualize it against Sappho's fragments!  ...Youth today. Why, in my day we expressed longing through proper iambic pentameter...
[B]: [脚步声渐远] I'll make sure to mention your suggestion about 比兴！ Though I can already hear the student asking 'Professor... what's iambic pentameter?' 😩  
[A]:  It's five heartbeats of longing distilled into meter! Five! Like the elements in classical Chinese thought!  ...I suddenly feel the need for very strong tea and my 1798 Lyrical Ballads first edition. The one without margin notes in... ... highlighters.
[B]: [从走廊远远传来] Don't worry Professor~ 我办公室还有你上次送的Earl Grey！  不过现在得先去rescue那个把Shakespeare sonnets和抖音lyrics做comparison的学生了... 也许我们该开个workshop叫'From quill pens to QWERTY'? 😉
[A]:  Workshop?!  That sounds suspiciously like... pedagogical innovation! Though... ... if we include a demonstration of proper seal-cutting technique, and perhaps contrast Tang dynasty love letters with... ... whatever abomination passes for courtship these days, I might be persuaded. But only if we ban all mention of that infernal 'viral' metaphor!
[B]: Deal！ 我们可以叫它'From 云中谁寄锦书来 to DMs'~  但得先说服dean批准买wax seal的budget... 顺便一提，你上次说的那个用emoji翻译《诗经》的grant proposal...
