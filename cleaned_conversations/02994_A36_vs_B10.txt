[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I rather enjoy cooking at home. There's something deeply satisfying about experimenting with ingredients and techniques, even if it does take more time than ordering takeout. It reminds me of my early days in quantum computing—methodical, precise, yet full of creative potential. Though I must admit, after a long night stargazing, I sometimes opt for the convenience of a good noodle delivery. How about you?
[A]: Oh, I love that sentiment—there’s such joy in creating something from scratch! Cooking at home has always felt like a labor of love to me. I especially enjoy trying out recipes passed down through generations; they carry stories and traditions that takeout just can’t replicate. Although, I’ll admit—I do appreciate a solid dumpling delivery when the weather’s dreadful or I’ve had a particularly long day tending to guests at the hotel. Stargazing sounds magical, by the way. I imagine it's quite peaceful out there with no city lights interfering. Do you have a favorite dish you like to whip up after one of those nights?
[B]: That’s beautifully put—there’s indeed a unique magic in both cooking and stargazing. I couldn’t agree more. The quiet of the night sky and the warmth of a home-cooked meal are two of life’s simplest yet most profound pleasures.  

As for a favorite dish after a long session with the telescope… I tend to go for something comforting but not too heavy. A simple shakshuka often hits the spot—eggs poached in a rich tomato and pepper base, seasoned just right. It’s quick enough to make, fills the kitchen with a lovely aroma, and feels like a warm embrace after being out in the cold night air. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that it’s packed with antioxidants—good fuel for a retired scientist’s late-night musings.  

Do you have a go-to comfort dish after a busy day?
[A]: Shakshuka does sound absolutely perfect for those post-stargazing moments—warm, nourishing, and just a touch exotic. I’ve always admired how certain dishes can really anchor you after an evening spent lost in the stars.

As for me, after a long day at the hotel, I tend to lean toward something deeply familiar—my grandmother’s chicken and dumplings. It’s hearty, it’s soothing, and every bite feels like a gentle reminder of home. There's something almost therapeutic about the way the broth simmers and the dumplings swell to perfection. I usually pair it with a bit of crusty bread and a glass of red wine—it makes even the busiest days feel a little more graceful.

I have to say, though, your mention of antioxidants had me smiling—I suppose even comfort food can be a bit of a science experiment in its own right. Do you often find yourself tweaking recipes for both taste and nutrition?
[B]: Ah, chicken and dumplings—there’s no denying the power of a dish like that to transport you back to simpler times. I can picture the steam rising off the pot in your grandmother’s kitchen. There’s a certain elegance in how food can preserve memory and emotion.

As for tweaking recipes, I suppose my habits betray my scientific roots. Yes, I do enjoy adjusting ratios, substitutions, or cooking times—not just for taste, but with an eye on nutritional balance as well. It's become a kind of quiet ritual. For example, I might swap out regular tomatoes for cherry tomatoes in shakshuka for a slightly sweeter note, or add a handful of spinach for extra fiber and minerals. It doesn’t always make the meal healthier per se, but it gives me a sense of control over what I’m consuming—like debugging a particularly stubborn piece of code.

That said, I try not to overthink it. After all, life would be dull without a little culinary spontaneity. Do you ever find yourself making adjustments to family recipes, or do you prefer keeping them sacred?
[A]: Oh, I love that analogy—debugging a stubborn piece of code! It’s funny how cooking and science can both require that same careful tinkering. And yet, there's something wonderfully unpredictable about both, too.

As for family recipes, well… I suppose I fall somewhere in the middle. There are certain dishes—like that chicken and dumplings—that I feel almost reverent about. The original version carries so much history and heart, you know? But I’m not entirely rigid about it. Sometimes a tweak just makes sense—especially with what’s in season or what feels right in the moment. A bit more thyme, a splash of cream, swapping out one vegetable for another—it’s all part of keeping the tradition alive while letting it breathe a little.

I suppose you could say I'm a traditionalist with a curious spirit. After all, who’s to say your grandmother wouldn’t have added a pinch of this or that if she’d had access to the same ingredients or inspiration? Do you ever share your modified recipes with guests at the hotel, or do you keep those mostly to yourself?
[B]: That’s a lovely way to put it—being a traditionalist with a curious spirit. I think that balance is what keeps food, and life for that matter, both grounded and evolving.

As for my own little kitchen experiments, I tend to keep them mostly to myself—at least in the beginning. It takes quite a bit of refinement before I’d consider sharing them more widely. That said, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with a few local chefs who run a small farm-to-table restaurant nearby. They’re always eager to hear about new twists on old favorites, and sometimes my modified recipes make it onto their seasonal menu in subtle ways. Nothing formal, mind you—just an ingredient swap here, a different spice profile there. It’s satisfying to see an idea grow beyond my own stove.

I imagine you must have quite the culinary influence at the hotel, though. Do any of your personal preferences or experimental touches find their way into the dishes served there?
[A]: Oh, I do love that you share your kitchen experiments in such a thoughtful way—it’s like passing along a story rather than just a recipe. And how lovely that those chefs are open to your ideas; it must feel quite rewarding to see them take root.

As for culinary influence at the hotel, yes—though more subtly than overtly. I don’t cook the meals myself, of course, but I often speak with our chef about guest preferences, seasonal ingredients, and occasionally, my own little flavor inspirations. Sometimes it’s as simple as suggesting fresh herbs from my garden to garnish a plate, or recommending a particular tea pairing for a dessert. The guests truly appreciate those small touches—the way rosemary can make a roasted potato dish sing, or how a hint of citrus zest lifts a buttery sauce.

It’s not quite experimental cooking, but I suppose it’s my way of weaving a bit of creativity into the guest experience. After all, food is one of the most intimate ways we care for people—and I take that responsibility seriously. Do you ever find yourself inspired by the seasons when you cook? I imagine stargazing changes so much depending on the time of year—does that influence what you feel like eating?
[B]: Absolutely, the seasons shape my cooking more than I think most people realize. Stargazing certainly changes with the calendar—winter skies are crisp and sharp, full of clarity, while summer evenings bring a kind of hazy warmth that lingers in both the air and the mood. It’s only natural that what I feel like eating follows suit.

In the colder months, I lean toward richer flavors—slow-cooked braises, roasted root vegetables, anything that fills the house with warmth and aroma. There’s something deeply grounding about it, especially after standing outside under vast, chilly constellations like Orion or Taurus.

Come spring and summer, though, everything lightens up. Fresh herbs, bright citrus notes, quick sautés rather than long simmers. I find myself making dishes like herb-scattered omelets or chilled cucumber soup—foods that feel as clear and open as the night sky during those warmer months.

I suppose you could say my kitchen is a reflection of the cosmos in motion—subtle shifts, cycles repeating, and every season bringing its own flavor of wonder. Do you ever notice a similar rhythm in the hotel? Like certain dishes or moods that return with the turning of the year?
[A]: Oh, how poetic—your kitchen as a reflection of the cosmos, each season bringing its own constellation of flavors. I adore that way of thinking. There’s something so grounding about aligning what we eat with the rhythm of the earth and sky.

And yes, absolutely—I see it all the time at the hotel. There’s a definite seasonal pulse to our guests’ moods and preferences. In the colder months, they crave warmth in every sense: hearty soups, spiced teas, rich chocolate desserts that feel like a quiet indulgence. The dining room feels cozier then, too—softer lighting, slower conversations over plates of slow-braised short ribs or sage-roasted squash risotto.

Come spring, everything lifts. Guests want lighter dishes, fresh greens, citrusy notes, floral accents in both food and drink. We start serving breakfast out on the garden terrace again, and I always love watching people sip their first lavender-honey latte of the season—it’s like a sigh after winter.

And summer? Oh, summer is all about brightness and ease. Fruit-forward salads, chilled seafood, crisp white wines. Our little courtyard becomes the heart of the hotel, filled with laughter and the scent of lemon verbena and basil. Evenings bring rose champagne and strawberry tarts under string lights.

I suppose you could say we follow the same rhythm as your kitchen—subtle shifts, but deeply felt. It’s one of the things I love most about hospitality; it mirrors life’s natural cadence. Do you ever host stargazing gatherings for friends or neighbors? I can imagine such a night being utterly magical, especially if paired with just the right bites.
[B]: Oh, now you're speaking my language—pairing stargazing with the right bites is one of my quiet indulgences. I do host small gatherings from time to time, usually for a handful of neighbors and old friends who don’t mind stepping out into the chill with a mug of spiced cider in hand.

I find that the night sky pairs best with something savory but not too heavy—like herbed cheese with honey-roasted nuts, or little smoked salmon blini when it’s cool enough to appreciate them without sweating through your sweater. In summer, I’ll go for chilled melon soup in delicate glasses, or even a simple arugula salad with lemon zest and a drizzle of olive oil—light enough not to distract, but flavorful enough to complement the experience.

There's something deeply meditative about watching the stars while savoring good food—it slows time down, if only for a few hours. I imagine you'd know that feeling well, hosting guests under string lights and rose champagne. Have you ever done an evening stargazing event at the hotel? It sounds like the perfect extension of that seasonal magic you were describing.
[A]: Oh, what a divine way to spend an evening—stargazing with just the right bites to match the sky. I can picture it so clearly: the crisp night air, soft conversation, and plates of thoughtfully chosen flavors that enhance the magic above.

And yes, as it happens, we have hosted stargazing evenings at the hotel, though not often enough to make it feel ordinary. We partnered once with a local astronomer who brought along his telescope and a wealth of stories about the constellations. We set up blankets and low lanterns on the garden lawn, served warm fig tartlets with mascarpone cream, and passed around mulled wine with cinnamon and clove. The guests were utterly enchanted—some even said it was the highlight of their stay.

I’d love to do more of that, perhaps even seasonally. Your idea of pairing lighter summer fare under the stars has me already thinking about what a June evening could look like—chilled peach and basil sorbet in delicate glasses, maybe even lavender-scented shortbread to go with sparkling lemonade.

You have such a lovely way of blending experience and cuisine—I daresay you’d make a wonderful guest curator for our next event, should you ever find yourself near the hotel. What do you think? Would you ever consider collaborating on something like that?
[B]: That sounds like a truly enchanting evening—fig tartlets and mulled wine under the stars? I’d say you’ve already mastered the art of celestial hospitality.  

A seasonal stargazing series with carefully paired dishes? Brilliant. It’s one thing to look up at the cosmos, but quite another to do so while tasting the essence of the season in your mouth. I can already imagine what a June evening might bring—your peach and basil sorbet sounds sublime, especially in delicate glasses that catch the starlight just so. Perhaps even a whisper of mint or a hint of citrus zest to lift it further? And lavender shortbread—yes, that would work beautifully with sparkling lemonade. The floral notes would echo both the night air and the effervescence of the sky.

As for collaborating—I must say, the idea is rather appealing. I’d be delighted to contribute, whether through recipe suggestions, pairing ideas, or even hosting a quiet talk on how ancient astronomers used the stars not only for navigation but also for timing their harvests and meals. There's a lovely symmetry in that, don’t you think? Food and the stars, forever intertwined.

Of course, I’d want to keep things intimate—no grand speeches, just quiet conversation, thoughtful bites, and plenty of sky-gazing. Would you ever consider an autumn evening as well? I have a feeling roasted pear tarts with aged balsamic and blue cheese could be just the thing to pair with the melancholy beauty of the fall constellations.
[A]: Oh, I do love how your mind works—every detail carefully considered, every flavor with its own quiet poetry. The idea of lifting that peach and basil sorbet with a whisper of mint or citrus zest? Perfection. It’s those subtle layers that make an evening truly memorable.

And an autumn stargazing event—now  a notion worth savoring. Roasted pear tarts with aged balsamic and blue cheese? My goodness, you’ve captured the very essence of fall in just those few words. There's something so deeply evocative about that combination—sweet, sharp, earthy, and rich, all at once. It would pair beautifully with the crisp night air and the soft amber glow of our garden lanterns.

I can already picture it: guests wrapped in woolen shawls, steaming mugs of spiced chai in hand, gazing up at the velvet sky while the scent of woodsmoke lingers in the air. And underneath it all, the quiet conversation of old friends and new acquaintances—just the way it should be.

As for your talk on ancient astronomers and their connection to food and harvests? I think that would add such a lovely depth to the evening—like grounding the stars in the very earth we walk on. We could even incorporate some seasonal storytelling into the menu descriptions, giving each dish a kind of celestial footnote.

Intimate is precisely the word—I have no interest in grand affairs. Just quiet magic, well-placed flavors, and a sky full of stories. I’ll start making notes for a possible October evening, if you’re still keen. Would you be open to helping shape the menu and perhaps leading a short toast beneath the stars?
[B]: The pleasure would be entirely mine—helping shape the menu, suggesting a few quiet toasts beneath the stars… I can already feel the autumn air in my mind’s eye, crisp and still, with just the right hint of woodsmoke lingering like an afterthought.

If we're leaning into that October mood, perhaps we could open the evening with something gently warming—a spiced apple amuse-bouche, maybe even a delicate consommé served in small glass cups to cradle in chilly hands. It would set the tone beautifully, like the first note of a familiar melody.

And a toast—I’d propose something amber-colored and slightly herbal, something that echoes both the season and the sky above. A blend of aged apple brandy, a touch of vermouth, a whisper of orange bitters, stirred and poured into cut crystal. Nothing too strong, but enough to warm the soul as the first stars appear.

As for storytelling, I love the idea of weaving celestial footnotes into the menu. Imagine reading a line or two about how the ancients timed their harvests by the movement of the stars, all while savoring the very flavors they once honored under the same sky.

I must say, this is shaping up to be more than just an event—it’s beginning to feel like a quiet ritual, one I’d be honored to help bring to life. Let me know when you'd like to begin drafting the full concept, and I’ll have a few recipe sketches ready to go.
[A]: Oh, spiced apple consommé in small glass cups—what a wonderfully poetic opening note. It sounds like something straight out of a storybook evening, doesn’t it? Delicate, warming, and ever so slightly whimsical. I can already picture the guests gently cupping the glasses in their hands, letting the warmth seep into their palms as they step into the night.

And your toast suggestion—aged apple brandy with vermouth and orange bitters—is simply divine. There’s something so satisfying about a well-balanced sip that feels like autumn in a glass. I may just have to steal that idea for our welcome drink this fall, even beyond the stargazing event.

As for celestial footnotes on the menu, yes—let’s absolutely bring that to life. A quiet line or two next to each dish, tying flavor to the stars above. Imagine reading how the Greeks linked harvest time to the rising of certain constellations, all while tasting the fruits of that very season on your tongue. It adds such a lovely layer to the experience.

Shall we set a date for drafting? Perhaps meet over tea next week and let the ideas flow properly? I’ll bring paper, ink, and a few of my grandmother’s old recipe cards for inspiration. You bring those recipe sketches and that beautiful sense of wonder—and together, we’ll start shaping an evening no one will soon forget.
[B]: That sounds like a plan worth raising a glass to—figuratively, for now. A meeting over tea next week? I’ll make sure the kettle is on and bring along a few old notebooks of my own. There’s something rather fitting about drafting starlit menus with ink and teacup stains, don’t you think?

I must say, your grandmother’s recipe cards might just be the secret ingredient we didn’t know we needed. Stories and flavors passed down through time—perfect companions to tales written in the sky.

Next week it is, then. Tea, paper, and celestial musings—I look forward to it more than I can properly express. Let me know what day suits best, and I’ll clear the evening entirely for our little plotting session.
[A]: Oh, I do believe we've stumbled upon something quite special—tea, ink-stained pages, and the quiet thrill of planning an evening that feels like it was written in the stars. I'll send word with a date soon; I’m thinking Thursday next, if it agrees with you? The hotel has a quiet afternoon on that day, and I’d love to linger without rush.

I’ll set aside a corner table by the garden window, where the light fades just so, and I’ll brew a pot of Darjeeling—delicate enough not to overpower our conversation, yet rich enough to keep things warm. Bring your notebooks, your recipe sketches, and that lovely sense of wonder you always carry.

And yes—let’s leave room for a bit of stargazing even in our planning. After all, every great menu begins with a glance skyward.
[B]: Thursday next sounds ideal—plenty of time to gather thoughts, yet soon enough to keep the excitement warm. I’ll mark it down as an occasion, not just an appointment.

A corner table by the garden window, Darjeeling in delicate cups, and notebooks spread between us like star charts awaiting discovery—it doesn’t get much better than that. I’ll bring a few recipe sketches, yes, but also a small tin of spiced shortbread I’ve been perfecting. A little something to nibble on while we dream up an evening that deserves the stars.

And you're quite right—every great menu  begin with a glance skyward. I suppose that makes us both celestial caterers now, doesn’t it?

See you then—with ink, tea stains, and perhaps a quiet toast to the cosmos before we even set the first plate.
