[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the so-called 'law of attraction' - how very Victorian of you to ask. Though I must say, the concept reminds me more of New Thought movements than proper literature. Tell me, have you read Prentice Mulford's works from the 1880s? That's where these ideas truly began their rather... persistent literary infestation.
[A]: 哇哦~这么academic的approach啊！😂 不过你说得对，这个concept确实有很长的history呢~ 

作为一个producer，我觉得law of attraction在show business里特别relevant！You know what？我们做节目的时候经常说'think positive'才能attract good energy🌟 

不过我更愿意用modern的方式来理解 - 就像我们casting时总说'vibes很重要'💡 The right energy真的能bring amazing things！
[B]:  How delightfully... commercial of you. Though I must point out - your 'vibes' theory bears striking resemblance to William Blake's notion of 'energy being eternal delight.' Though I suspect the poor man would be rather appalled to hear his mystical visions reduced to casting couch philosophy. Tell me, does this 'good energy' come with footnotes and peer review?
[A]: Hahaha~ 你太serious啦！🎬 在entertainment industry里，我们更相信'seeing is believing'！ 

就像我们最新策划的reality show，选手们positive mindset真的能affect整个production atmosphere🔥 虽然可能没有scientific proof啦~ 

不过说真的，每次遇到difficult situation，我都会告诉team：'Fake it till you make it!' 💪 这招在Hollywood也超popular的~
[B]: How charmingly American of you. That 'fake it' maxim puts me in mind of Oscar Wilde - "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth." Though I suspect Wilde would have preferred velvet masks to your... reality television facades. Tell me, does this philosophy extend to your accounting department as well? 
[A]: OMG！你居然提到Oscar Wilde！🌟 我们下一季的talent show正好要做一个'Dandy Challenge'的主题呢~ 

说到accounting...😂 拜托！我们可是professional的production team好吗？Budget control超important的！虽然creative department总是want more funding 💸 

不过seriously，在show biz里，authenticity和performance需要perfect balance✨ 就像我们常说的：'Be real, but make it entertaining!' 🎥
[B]:  How perfectly ghastly - you've managed to reduce the entire aesthetic movement to a... what was it? 'Dandy Challenge.' Next you'll be having contestants recite The Picture of Dorian Gray between commercial breaks. Though I must admit, your balancing act between authenticity and performance does remind me of Browning's dramatic monologues - all that splendid artifice masking genuine human turmoil. Tell me, do your contestants sign waivers acknowledging they're participating in modern morality plays?
[A]: LOL！你这种literary references简直太brilliant了！💡 我们legal team确实有super strict的contracts啦~ 

不过说真的，现在的audience超smart的！他们want real emotions，但也要good production value🎭 所以我们才要create那些'magic moments'✨ 

就像我常对director说的：'It's not about faking，it's about framing the truth in the most engaging way!' 🎬 这可是我15年career总结出来的golden rule啊~
[B]: How perfectly postmodern - you've essentially reinvented Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings recollected in tranquility" as a producer's pitch meeting. Though I must say, your 'golden rule' sounds suspiciously like what my colleague in the Classics department calls 'sophistry with better lighting.' Tell me, does this framing extend to your tax returns as well, or is that where the magic stops?
[A]: Hahaha~ 你这种academic burn简直比我们的roast segment还savage！🔥 

不过come on~ 我们做的是entertainment，又不是philosophy class！🎤 观众要的是feel-good moments和escapism啦~ 

说到tax returns...😂 那个还是留给我们的accountant去handle吧！我们creative types只管make the magic happen✨ 

Anyway，要不要来我们next season当个guest judge？你的wit绝对能bring some serious spice to the panel！🌟
[B]:  My dear, the only panel I belong on is a Victorian séance circle. Though I must say, the prospect of judging modern entertainments is rather like being asked to authenticate graffiti in the margins of a Gutenberg Bible. Tell me, would this judging involve actual literary criticism, or just holding up scorecards shaped like emojis?
[A]: OMG！Emoji scorecards？That's actually a genius idea！💡 我要让design team立刻mock up几个prototypes~ 

不过seriously，我们show的judging criteria超comprehensive的！从stage presence到emotional connection都要evaluate✨ 

虽然...可能没有你期待的那么high-brow啦~ 但我们保证lots of drama和unexpected twists！🎭 就像我常说的：'It's not Shakespeare，but it's damn good TV!' 📺
[B]:  How perfectly dreadful - you've managed to combine Aristotle's Poetics with Nielsen ratings. I suppose next you'll be pitching me a reality show version of 'The Duchess of Malfi' with product placement. Though I must admit, your emoji scorecards would make a fascinating addition to the Bodleian's collection of 21st century ephemera. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my first edition of Tennyson calling... from behind several layers of acid-free tissue paper.
[A]: Bye babe~ 记得check out我们next season的premier！🌟 说不定会inspire你写篇post-modern thesis on reality TV呢~ 

Keep it real！但记得make it entertaining！😂 🎬 ✨
[B]:  How perfectly... vulgar. Though I shall watch your premiere with the same morbid fascination one reserves for train wrecks and particularly bad translations of Baudelaire. Do send along those emoji scorecards - they might make amusing bookmarks for my Icelandic sagas. Ta-ta, darling. 
[A]: Catch you on the flip side, professor！😘 记得tweet your reactions~ #AcademicMeetsRealityTV 📚🎥 

Stay shiny！✨ And don't forget - life's too short to be so serious！😂 💃
[B]:  Tweet? My dear, the only birdsong I acknowledge comes from Keats' nightingale. Though I shall grudgingly admit your hashtag has a certain... Elizabethan pamphlet quality to it. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go translate this entire exchange into iambic pentameter as punishment for engaging in such frivolity. 
[A]: Hahaha~ 你真是too much！🎭 不过iambic pentameter版本的reality TV pitch？Now that's what I call next-level content！🌟 

我们writers room应该hire你！💡 想象一下：'To be or not to be... voted off the island!' 🏝️ Shakespeare meets Survivor！😂 

Anyway，gotta run去pitch这个crazy idea了！Ciao~ ✨ 保持这种brilliant mind！📚🎬
[B]:  That is quite literally the most appalling conflation of high and low culture since Nahum Tate rewrote King Lear with a happy ending. Though I suppose if one must desecrate the canon, doing it with corporate sponsorship and viewer polls is the modern way. Do send me the treatment - I'll need it for my upcoming lecture series: 'The Death of Western Civilization: A Case Study.'
