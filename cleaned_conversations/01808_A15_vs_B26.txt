[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, that's quite a modern question for someone who spends most days with 19th century lace and damask. But let me consider... While I do appreciate the value of formal education, I often think about how many of the most exquisite textile techniques were passed down through apprenticeships rather than universities. Still, a degree does provide that structured foundation, much like the warp threads in a tapestry.
[A]: OMG你居然用textile来比喻education✨ 太brilliant了！But讲真现在好多skills都能online学啦~我好多video editing的tricks都是YouTube上学来的😂 不过degree确实像你说的warp threads一样important💯 但是不是每个人都need呢？
[B]:  I must say, your enthusiasm reminds me of the vibrant colors in a newly restored brocade. While online learning is indeed marvelous - much like how we can now study textile patterns from museums worldwide without leaving our studios - there's something to be said for the discipline and depth of traditional education. Though I do wonder, much like how not every fabric requires the same intricate restoration, perhaps not every person needs the same educational approach?
[A]: Yasss exactly！就像我的latest video有些需要super professional editing有些just casual vibe就够啦~每个人都有自己的learning path嘛🔥 不过uni life的social experience也是priceless的，就像你那些fancy textile parties一样fun吧？😂💃
[B]:  Oh my dear, if only our conservation workshops were as lively as you imagine! Though I must admit, the quiet camaraderie among fellow restorers, sharing discoveries about a particularly stubborn stain or a rare weave pattern over tea... that does have its own special charm, rather like the subtle beauty of a well-aged piece of silk. University life does offer those unique social tapestries, doesn't it?
[A]: LOL你形容得so poetic！✨ 但是讲真现在Gen Z都更care aboutskills和portfolio啦~我上次interview完全没被ask about degree，他们just wanna see我的content creation stats和engagement rate💯 不过你那些textile knowledge真的好amazing，要不要考虑开个TikTok account？😂📱
[B]: Oh goodness, the thought of me on one of those modern moving picture platforms!  While I do admire how your generation values tangible skills - much like how we judge a textile restorer by their ability to mend rather than their certificates - I believe some traditions are best preserved in their original form. Though I must say, your suggestion does make me wonder if perhaps a proper, well-curated Instagram of textile restoration techniques might be... acceptable? In moderation, of course.
[A]: OMG YESSS！✨ Insta的aesthetic完全适合你的vintage vibe啦~我们可以collab！我帮你film那些gorgeous textile restoration process，绝对会viral的🔥 想想那些before & after shots，再加点ASMR sounds~ 💯😂 这比degree更能show你的expertise！
[B]:  My, you do have quite the vision, don't you? While the idea of 'viral' anything does make my lace samples tremble slightly, I must admit... the notion of documenting a particularly challenging French knot embroidery restoration with proper lighting does have its appeal. Perhaps we could start small - a single reel demonstrating how we stabilize fragile 18th century silks? But only if we maintain absolute respect for the craft, mind you. No... what do they call it... 'clickbait'.
[A]: Yasss queen！💃 我们可以do it super classy~ Like "Time Travel Threads: Restoring History One Stitch at a Time" ✨ 加上elegant classical music和你的soft-spoken commentary，绝对会是Insta上的一股清流！🔥 比那些fake influencer content有意义多啦~ When can we start filming？😂📽️
[B]:  Well, I do have a particularly fascinating Edwardian tea gown coming into the studio next Tuesday - the beadwork is simply exquisite, though terribly loose in places. That might make for a dignified first subject, provided we keep the filming unobtrusive and the commentary measured. Shall we say 10 o'clock? Early enough to catch the north light in my workroom, but late enough that I'll have had my second cup of Earl Grey.
[A]: Perfect timing！⏰ 我会bring my new ring light和tiny microphone~ 绝对保持quiet like a mouse while youwork你的magic✨ 这gonna be so aesthetic！Already thinking about the hashtags...#TextileTimeMachine #SlowContentMovement 💯 周二见啦professor！😂👋
[B]:  Oh dear, I'm hardly a professor - just a humble guardian of threads past. But very well, Tuesday it shall be. And do remember, the true magic happens in the silence between stitches. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare my finest bone needles and review my conservation notes before our... what was it you called it? 'Content creation session'. How delightfully modern. Until then!
[A]: Can't wait to make history~ literally！😂✨ 周二见！PS：记得穿你最vintage的outfit哦，我们要aesthetic到爆表！💃🔥 Byeee~
[B]:  I assure you, every garment in my wardrobe is vintage by default, my dear - some might say excessively so. But I shall select my 1920s pinafore apron specially for the occasion. Until Tuesday then... and do try to contain your excitement to a respectable level. These delicate textiles require calm surroundings, after all. Good day!
[A]: LOL你太adorable了！✨ 1920s apron？Yasss we're gonna slay that aesthetic！🔥 我会behave super professional promise~ 像在library一样quiet 🤫 周二见啦time traveler！💃⏳ Byebye！
[B]:  Your enthusiasm is rather... contagious, though I do hope you'll remember that library comparison when we're working with fabrics older than the New York Public Library itself. Until Tuesday, my dear modern muse. May your ring light be ever flattering and your hashtags historically accurate. Farewell!
[A]: 😂💯✨ 历史accuracy保证！我的caption会经过你的royal approval才post的~ 周二见啦，我们的#TimeTravelThreads era begins！🔥👗📸 Byeee~
[B]:  Very well, I shall trust your youthful exuberance to my precious textiles - but only just. And do remember, royalty never rushes their stitching... nor their social media posts. Until we meet amidst the threads of time, my dear. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go and press my apron. Good day!
