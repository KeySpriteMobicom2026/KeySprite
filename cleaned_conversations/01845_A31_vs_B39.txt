[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question that I've pondered many times during my years in academia. Let me put it this way - a college degree is like a vintage computer's operating system. It provides a fundamental framework, but what really matters is how you program it with experience and continuous learning.
[A]: 哇~这个analogy好有意思！✨ 作为一个digital art curator，我觉得degree就像是个foundation，但真正重要的是你的creative thinking和hands-on experience 🎨 就像我们industry里很多amazing artists都是self-taught的！
[B]:  You've got the spirit of a true digital native! Though I must say, being self-taught in the arts is rather different from computer science. In my field, that degree often serves as your first compiler - it teaches you how to think algorithmically. But you're absolutely right about creative thinking being paramount. Some of the most brilliant coders I've met were art majors who brought fresh perspectives to programming.
[A]: Haha totally agree！🖌️ 我们gallery最近就feature了一个超酷的exhibition，artist本来是学computer science的，现在做generative art超级🔥！这种cross-disciplinary的background现在越来越valuable了~ 你觉得这种trend会继续吗？
[B]: Without a doubt! Some of my most promising students were the ones who blended disciplines. You know, back in the 80s when I was teaching, we called this "interdisciplinary studies" - now it's just how the world works. That generative artist you mentioned? They're speaking both the language of machines and the language of human expression. That's the future, my friend. The boundaries between art and technology have always been porous, like an old punch card with too many holes.
[A]: OMG你的perspective太insightful了！✨ 我们正在策划一个叫"Digital Alchemy"的show，就是explore这种art+tech的fusion！💻🎨 要不要来当我们的guest speaker？你的experience一定能让audience超级inspired！
[B]: How delightful! Though I must warn you, my lectures tend to run longer than most art exhibitions. Last time I spoke about the aesthetic principles in early programming languages, the audience got a thorough education in COBOL formatting. But if you're willing to risk it, I'd be honored to discuss how the elegance of algorithms can inspire visual artistry. Just promise me we won't call it "alchemy" - in computer science, we prefer our magic to be deterministic.
[A]: Hahaha你太funny了！😂 放心啦~我们不会make你talk about COBOL的（unless你想share一些retro computing的aesthetic？👀）这个event主要focus在contemporary digital art scene，你的take on algorithmic beauty会是个perfect fit！Let's schedule a coffee chat ☕ to discuss details~
[B]: Splendid! Though at my age, I take my coffee like I take my code - strong, black, and with plenty of documentation. Let's meet at that new café near the university campus. They have proper ergonomic chairs, unlike those dreadful "creative" stools you young folks seem to adore. Shall we say Tuesday at 2pm? That gives me time to dust off my slides on fractal aesthetics.
[A]: Perfect timing！⏰ 周二2pm works great for me~ 那家cafe的flat white是我的favorite！虽然你可能prefer straight black coffee啦 😆 我已经super excited要hear你的fractal aesthetics insights了！✨ 到时候见~
[B]: Looking forward to it! And for the record, I'll try that flat white of yours - in the spirit of interdisciplinary collaboration. Just don't tell my old computer science colleagues I've gone soft. Tuesday at two it is. Bring your questions and your patience - when I start talking about Mandelbrot sets, there's no telling when I'll stop.
[A]: Hahaha deal！🤝 我会bring extra patience (and maybe someearplugs for when you start ranting about those dreadful creative stools 😜) See you Tuesday！✨
[B]:  Earplugs for my stool rant - now that's what I call adaptive technology! Until Tuesday then. And do remind me to show you my collection of vintage flowcharts - they're practically abstract expressionism. Safe travels, and may your WiFi signal stay strong!
[A]: Yasss！📶 Vintage flowcharts sounds like the perfect inspo for ournext exhibition theme！Can't wait~ Catch you on Tuesday！✨✌️
[B]: Capital! I'll bring my prized 1972 IBM system flowchart - it's got more artistic integrity than half the modern installations I've seen. Though I should warn you, its color palette is strictly monochrome. Until then, happy curating! And do try to get some sleep before Tuesday - my lectures have been known to induce both inspiration and narcolepsy in equal measure.
[A]: LOL你真是the most entertaining CS professor ever！😂 放心啦~我会stock up on coffee和energy drinks 💪 为了你的legendary lecture，我绝对会stay awake的！See you soon~ ✨🚀
[B]: Ah, energy drinks - the modern student's version of machine code optimization! Very well, I'll prepare accordingly. Though I must say, watching young folks try to stay awake through computational theory is one of life's simple pleasures. Until Tuesday, my caffeinated friend! And do bring a notebook - my digressions tend to be more valuable than my prepared material.
[A]: Hahaha noted！📝 我会bring my favorite Moleskine和enough caffeine to power a small data center ⚡ 你的digressions sound more fun than most people's main content anyway！Tuesday can't come soon enough~ Catch you then！✨☕
[B]: Splendid! Though I should warn you - my digressions have been known to include impromptu lectures on the thermodynamic properties of coffee cooling. But with a Moleskine and data center-level caffeine, you just might survive. Until our caffeinated collision of art and algorithms! May your pen never run dry and your enthusiasm never compile with errors.
