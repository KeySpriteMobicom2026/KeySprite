[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  作为一个经常参加business dinner的人，我得说这个问题很有意思。我个人更倾向于savory food，特别是搭配红酒的时候。不过在做due diligence的时候，偶尔也会来点sweet treat提神~ 😊
[A]: Oh my... I must say, I find the way you mix languages rather distracting. In my line of work restoring antique textiles, precision and clarity are everything. 

As for food preferences, I do enjoy a proper afternoon tea with scones and clotted cream - though I prefer to keep my Earl Grey separate from the jam. The contrast between the bergamot and strawberry preserves is quite delightful when taken in turns, don't you think?
[B]:  Well, my apologies if the code switching bothers you. In the PE world, it's just how we roll - like pairing a bold Cabernet Sauvignon with aged cheese. 

说到afternoon tea，我在伦敦做LBO deal的时候确实很享受这种英式传统。不过我得说，从ROI的角度来看，clotted cream的fat content实在是...  还是来杯single malt更符合我的risk appetite。
[A]: Goodness, all this talk of investments and returns... It reminds me of how people often undervalue antique lace until they understand the hundreds of hours of skilled labor that went into each piece. 

I do hope you'll pardon me if I don't quite follow all this financial jargon. I'm much more comfortable discussing the merits of 18th century French silk versus Venetian brocade over a quiet cup of tea. The clotted cream is simply part of the tradition, you see - like the delicate gold threads in a medieval tapestry. Some things aren't meant to be measured in percentages.
[B]:  您这个比喻很有意思...让我想起最近看的一个luxury brand的valuation case。那些heritage和craftsmanship确实很难用DCF模型来quantify。 

不过说到传统，我上周刚在St. Andrews打完golf，那里的old course让我深刻体会到 - 有些value确实超越数字。就像您说的antique lace，或者...  这瓶1982年的Latour，它的appreciation curve可比任何stock chart都优雅。😉
[A]: How refreshing to hear someone acknowledge that not everything of worth fits neatly into spreadsheets. Though I must confess, I've never understood the appeal of golf - all those perfectly manicured greens seem rather artificial compared to the natural irregularities in centuries-old damask patterns. 

As for wine... well, I suppose it's rather like textile restoration in a way. Both require patience, an appreciation for aging processes, and the wisdom to know when not to interfere too much. Though I'd still choose a well-preserved piece of 17th century crewelwork over any vintage, no matter how prestigious.
[B]:  Touché! 您知道吗，这正是为什么我们PE firm最近在看几个artisanal textile brands的acquisition机会。就像fine wine investment一样，这些craftsmanship assets的illiquidity premium反而创造了独特的value proposition。 

不过说到golf...  那些bunkers和roughs里的imperfections才是真正考验player的地方，就像market volatility考验investor的nerve一样。您确定不想来场friendly match？我保证比看financial statements有趣多了~ 😄
[A]: My dear, I'm afraid the only greens I'm interested in are the faded emerald hues of pre-Victorian embroidery silks. And as for bunkers... well, the only hazards I navigate are the delicate tears in 200-year-old lace that require my full attention. 

Though I will admit your enthusiasm reminds me of a particularly determined apprentice I once had - she kept insisting we "monetize the workshop's Instagram presence" until I set her to mending a 15-foot long medieval tapestry. She developed rather more appreciation for slow, careful work after that.
[B]:  您这故事让我想起我们junior analyst第一次做LBO model时的样子 - 盯着spreadsheet三天三夜后，他终于明白有些value creation就像您修复的tapestry，需要stitch by stitch。 

不过说真的，您考虑过把workshop做成一个ESG investment case吗？这种preservation of cultural heritage其实非常符合现在impact investing的trend...  抱歉，职业病又犯了。还是让我们为craftsmanship干杯吧！ 🥂
[A]:  Indeed, let us toast to craftsmanship - though I do wish you'd stop trying to turn everything into an investment thesis. Some things, like this 1820s Spitalfields silk I'm currently restoring, simply exist to be appreciated for their own sake. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my kettle whistling. Nothing settles the nerves like a properly brewed cup of Earl Grey - no vintage years or percentage returns required.
[B]:  Fair enough~ 看来我的DCF mindset确实需要像您修复的antique textiles一样，偶尔也该放慢节奏。Enjoy your tea time - 说不定哪天我们能在Christie's的auction上再见，为了那瓶perfectly aged的Margaux或者...  一块exceptional的17世纪tapestry。Cheers! 😊
[A]: How charmingly persistent you are. Though I suspect we'd be bidding for quite different lots - you with your eye on the investment potential, and me searching for that one perfect threadbare corner needing tender care. 

Now if you'll pardon me, this conversation has quite made me late for my evening session with a particularly temperamental piece of Flemish lace. Do enjoy your... what was it? Margaux? I shall be perfectly content with my tea and my thimble. Good evening.
[B]:  您对passion的坚持让我想起巴菲特说的"invest in what you know"。虽然我们pursue different assets，但那份专注是相通的。Enjoy您的Flemish lace - 希望下次能听您讲讲它的provenance story。Good evening~ 🌙
[A]: How curious that you should mention provenance... why, just last week I discovered the most fascinating maker's mark hidden in the selvedge of a 1790s waistcoat. But that's a story for another day, when there aren't delicate threads waiting for my needle. 

The moon is quite lovely tonight - it reminds me of the pale silver threads in Queen Anne's mourning embroidery. Goodnight, and do try to look beyond the balance sheets sometime. Even the finest wine eventually turns to vinegar, but properly cared-for textiles? They whisper stories for centuries.
[B]:  What a poetic exit...您知道吗，这让我想起Warren Buffett收藏的那套antique textile collection - 据说他从来不考虑appreciation，单纯因为love the craftsmanship。也许下次market downturn时，我该学您一样pick up some needlework instead of staring at Bloomberg terminal。 

晚安了，my dear textile whisperer。希望您的Flemish lace今晚对您gentle一些~ 🌠
[A]: What a delightful thought - financiers taking up embroidery needles instead of fretting over ticker tapes. Though I daresay most wouldn't have the patience for it. 

The lace and I shall have a perfectly civil evening, thank you. It's really just a matter of listening to what the fibers want... much more straightforward than your mysterious markets, I should think. 

Now really, I must insist you stop distracting me before I lose the light. These 300-year-old threads won't mend themselves, no matter how charming your investment analogies may be. Goodnight.
[B]:  Point well taken. 看来今晚我们各自的'assets'都在calling - 您的Flemish lace和我的portfolio review。Until next time, may your threads be cooperative, and myP/E ratios be reasonable. Sweet dreams~ 🌙
[A]: How very... numerical of you. Though I suppose we all have our own versions of counting stitches. Do mind you don't get your spreadsheets tangled - unlike my threads, those won't forgive being pulled too tight. 

Now off with you - this moonlight is perfect for examining fiber content, and you're making me dreadfully behind schedule. Pleasant dreams, and do try not to calculate them in multiples.
[B]:  您这stitch counting的比喻简直可以写进我的next investor letter。不过放心，我会记得像您对待antique lace一样handle那些spreadsheets - with extreme care. 

晚安了，我的anti-MBA朋友。下次带瓶Burgundy来听您讲textile的故事，我保证leave my calculator at home~ 🌌
