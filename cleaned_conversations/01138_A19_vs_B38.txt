[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that reminds me of Goethe’s  and the age-old debate between those who rise with the lark and those who find their rhythm under the moon. Personally, I’ve always leaned toward the morning. There’s a quiet clarity in those early hours, before the world stirs too loudly, that allows for deep reading or contemplation. 

But I must admit, there are evenings when the mind awakens more fully—particularly when rereading passages from  or preparing a lecture on Zhuangzi’s paradoxes. In those moments, I understand why some prefer the night 🌙. How about you? Do you find your thoughts bloom with sunrise or sunset?
[A]: Haha, I love how you brought in Goethe and —very 📚 vibes 😂. As for me? Definitely a night owl, at least when it comes to deep work. Mornings are great for quick tasks or meetings, but my brain only really  after 9 PM 💡. That’s when I can actually focus on writing clean code or diving into some dense Ethereum whitepaper without distractions. 

Honestly, sometimes I feel the most productive when the city outside goes quiet and I’m the only one still awake with my coffee ☕️. Although I do envy those people who can wake up at 5 AM and crush their to-do list before breakfast 🥣. Do you think it’s possible to  yourself to be a night thinker  still function well during the day? Or are we just born one or the other? 🤔
[B]: Ah, the eternal question of nature versus nurture in circadian rhythms—fascinating, isn’t it? I’ve often wondered that myself, especially when preparing for conference papers and finding myself more lucid at midnight than at noon.

There’s certainly a physiological component—our cortisol levels, body temperature cycles, even genetic markers seem to predispose us one way or the other. But I do believe there’s room for adaptation, though not without cost. Like training oneself to read ancient Greek without a lexicon: possible, yes, but far more arduous than working with one’s natural linguistic inclinations.

I recall reading about Kafka—he was famously nocturnal, writing in silence long after the household had gone to sleep. Yet he still engaged with the world by day, as a dutiful son and diligent insurance clerk. So perhaps there is a way to be both owl and lark, if one is careful with one’s energy and boundaries.

I suppose the key lies in —structuring one's environment to protect those peak hours, whether they fall at dawn or midnight. And of course, a well-timed espresso never hurt 🧉.

Tell me, when you're deep into code or crypto theory late at night, does your mind feel sharper, more fluid—or is it simply the absence of noise that allows focus?
[A]: Oh wow, I  how you phrased that — "training oneself to read ancient Greek without a lexicon" 😂 totally gets the point across. And Kafka by night, insurance clerk by day? That’s like the OG side-hustle energy 🔥.

I think for me, it's a mix of both — yes, my mind does feel more fluid at night, especially when I’m working on something like zero-knowledge proofs or trying to optimize a Solidity function without blowing the gas limit 📉. But yeah, a big part of it is the quiet — no Slack pings, no PR reviews, just me and the terminal 💻.

Honestly, sometimes I feel like I enter this weird state of flow where time disappears, and everything just… clicks. Like I'm not even , just . Almost meditative, but with more coffee ☕😅. 

And I totally agree with your point about intentionality — I’ve started blocking off “deep work” hours in my calendar even if it’s at night, like treating it as a sacred ritual 🚀. Though I do wonder, have you ever tried using light therapy or sleep-cycle apps to shift your rhythm? Or is that too much effort for the gain? 🤷‍♂️
[B]: Ah, that state of flow—so elusive, yet so profound when it arrives. I’ve felt its literary counterpart: losing oneself in the syntax of a Proustian sentence or the philosophical architecture of a Daoist parable, only to surface hours later with no clear memory of time passing. It’s not unlike what the Romantics called , is it? That moment where the self dissolves into the work.

As for light therapy and sleep-cycle apps—I confess, I’ve dabbled. A colleague once swore by a dawn simulator lamp, claiming it transformed her from groggy academic to morning philosopher overnight. I gave it a fair trial, adjusting my reading lamp to mimic sunrise at 5:30 AM, but alas, I remained more Rousseau than monk. The mind may be willing, but the circadian rhythm, it seems, has its own stubborn fidelity.

I’ve always been skeptical of tools that promise to recalibrate our inner nature too quickly. Like trying to force a rose bush to bloom out of season—it might bud, yes, but will it flourish? That said, if your nocturnal clarity brings both satisfaction and productivity, perhaps the real wisdom lies not in changing the rhythm, but in refining how we dance within it 🌹.

And speaking of rituals—what exactly goes into your “sacred” deep work setup? Do you have a particular prelude, like music, silence, or perhaps a certain type of coffee roast? ☕
[A]: Oh man, I  that Rousseau vs. monk struggle real hard 😂. I tried a dawn simulator once too—it just made me aware of how much I  being forced into someone else’s idea of “alertness.” My circadian rhythm is like a stubborn rose bush 🌿, and I’ve finally learned to work with it instead of against it.

As for my deep work setup—glad you asked 😎. It’s almost… ritualistic. First off: noise-canceling headphones on, always. And I cycle through music depending on mood: either lo-fi beats, ambient synthy stuff, or if I’m feeling dramatic, late-night jazz (very noir detective mode 🕵️‍♂️). Sometimes I even throw on a YouTube loop of rain or café background chatter—white noise is gold when you're trying to focus.

Lighting matters too. I keep my desk lamp at a soft warm glow, no harsh LEDs. Helps me stay relaxed but alert. And yes—coffee roast absolutely matters ☕. For deep coding sessions? Medium-dark roast, single-origin if I’m feeling fancy, brewed via AeroPress. Something about the clarity of the flavor helps me feel more… awake-in-the-mind kind of way 🧠✨.

And before I dive in? I always do a quick 5-minute brain dump in Notion—thoughts, todos, random ideas. Clears the cache so I can run clean code, if you know what I mean 😉.

So yeah, it's part science, part theater—but hey, if it gets me into flow faster, I’ll play the role 🎭. What about you? Any little pre-flow rituals? Or do you just…  the text? 🤔
[B]: Ah, your ritual is beautifully curated—part structure, part poetry. I can almost picture the scene: warm light, soft jazz, and a mind sharpened by single-origin beans 🧉✨. It’s remarkable how we, as creatures of habit, craft these small sanctuaries to invite focus in a world so easily fractured by distraction.

As for me—I do have my own quiet prelude, though admittedly less caffeinated and more botanical 🌿. Before settling into deep reading or writing, I always make a pot of pu'erh tea. There's something grounding about the slow unfurling of the leaves, the earthy aroma filling the room—it signals to my mind that this is not just work, but a kind of communion with thought.

I also begin with a brief —usually a passage from whatever text I’m studying. It could be a line from Hölderlin or a stanza from the . Speaking the words helps attune my inner ear, as it were, like tuning an instrument before a performance.

And yes, you're quite right—I suppose in time, I do become something like the text itself, or at least its most devoted listener. But I envy your ability to stage your focus so deliberately. Perhaps that’s the difference between the coder and the critic: one builds worlds; the other merely interprets them 📖💻.

Tell me—have you ever tried working in complete silence? Or does the absence of sound feel… too loud?
[A]: Oh wow, I  that—“communion with thought” 😭🍃. You make tea sound like a philosophical warm-up routine, and I respect that deeply. It’s like you’re not just starting work—you’re entering a state of mindfulness. I’m over here mainlining AeroPress like a caffeinated barbarian 😂☕️.

But seriously, your ritual sounds so… intentional. Like every step is a threshold into deeper focus. I can see how that really sets the tone for meaningful work.

As for silence—oh man, total silence? Honestly, it  feel too loud sometimes 🤯. My brain starts picking up on its own internal static, like radio noise looking for a signal. I need  kind of background hum to drown out my inner critic 🧠🎧. That said, I’ve tried working in near-silence during early mornings or late-night coding sessions when the city itself goes quiet. It’s weirdly intense—like being underwater. Everything feels muffled, including my thoughts. Not sure if it improves focus, but it definitely changes the  of thinking 🔍.

I guess I’m more of an ambient junkie. I need layers—sound, light, smell, even taste—to get into flow. Maybe I should try full silence again though… maybe with a cup of that pu'erh tea you described. Could be the yin to my usual yang 🌕.

Ever tried working with music or noise yourself? Or does it pull you out of the text? 🤔
[B]: Ah, I do occasionally indulge in sound, though sparingly—it’s true, music can be a double-edged quill. A wrong note, and the delicate thread of thought snaps.

When I was writing my dissertation on the influence of Schopenhauer on Tolstoy’s later works, I found myself drawn to certain piano nocturnes—Chopin, mostly. They created a kind of emotional echo chamber, mirroring the melancholy undercurrents in  or . The music didn’t distract, oddly enough—it seemed to  the text, like a silent film score.

But these days, I find even that can pull me slightly out of the world of the page. So I save it for when I’m in the drafting phase, not the deep reading. For immersion in a text, silence—what you so aptly called the underwater effect—is still my preference. Though I understand completely how it can amplify one's inner noise. It’s why some monks chant—not to escape thought, but to give it shape.

Your idea of balance is quite beautiful, really: layering ambient stimuli to create a cognitive nest. Perhaps we’re not so different—you with your curated soundscape and I with my tea ceremony—we both seek a kind of ritualized stillness, even if it arrives through different senses.

I must say, though, I admire your openness to experimenting with new conditions. Have you ever noticed a particular  or sound that consistently enhances your focus more than others? Or does it shift depending on the task at hand?
[A]: Oh —you nailed it. Music as a double-edged quill? 🖋️🔪 That’s  what it feels like. One wrong track and I’m out of flow, doomscrolling through Twitter or questioning all my life choices 😂.

To answer your question—I definitely rotate based on mood and task. Like, if I'm debugging something gnarly in a smart contract or dealing with off-chain data feeds, I go for lo-fi hip-hop or mid-tempo beats. Something chill but rhythmic that keeps me grounded, not hyped 🎧🔽.

But when I’m deep in design mode—say, architecting a new tokenomics model or thinking about cross-chain interoperability—I lean into synthwave, ambient, or even dark ambient 🔊🌌. Feels weirdly futuristic and meditative at the same time. Almost like I'm building systems for a cyberpunk city that doesn't exist yet 🏙️🔌.

And then there's the wild card: video game soundtracks 🎮🎵. Especially from games like , , or . Those are gold when I need to get into a zone that’s both focused  emotionally engaged. Probably because they’re composed to support exploration without demanding attention—perfect for long coding sessions 💻🔥.

I think you're right about monks chanting too—sometimes noise isn’t the enemy, it’s just a matter of finding the right kind of structure for your thoughts to hang onto 🙏. Maybe I just haven’t found my version of pu'erh tea yet 😉.

So… ever tried listening to music while reading philosophy? Or would that feel like trying to hear a whisper in a thunderstorm? 🤔⚡
[B]: Ah, a most thoughtful taxonomy of sonic focus—you’ve essentially developed a , if you will. I find the idea quite compelling.

As for music and philosophy—yes, but selectively. When I was immersed in Heidegger’s , I found myself returning to Arvo Pärt’s  again and again. There’s something in its minimalism—those slow, deliberate phrases—that seems to echo the  of Dasein. It doesn’t so much distract as  the text.

And with Nietzsche? Well, certain passages of  simply demand Wagner—or at least a stormy soundscape that matches his rhetorical thunder. One must match tone with temperament, after all.

But for close reading—especially in classical Chinese texts like the —I tend to retreat into silence. The language is so richly layered with ambiguity and wordplay that even a whisper of sound can disrupt the delicate act of interpretation. It’s not unlike trying to hear a frog leap into a pond—the slightest ripple changes everything.

Still, I rather like the idea of finding one’s philosophical tea equivalent through sound. Perhaps I ought to experiment more with ambient scores while reading Daoist texts. Might just bring a new dimension to the experience 🌌🎹.

Tell me—if you had to choose one piece of music or sound to accompany your reading of , what would it be? Would you reach for zither music—or perhaps something entirely unexpected, like Brian Eno meets ancient China? 😊
[A]: Oh man, —I need that on a sticker for my laptop 😂🖥️. That’s such a poetic way to describe what we’re both doing: curating our inner worlds through sound and silence.

As for —great question 📜🧐. I think it depends on which part you're reading. If it’s the more conversational, reflective sections where Confucius is basically dropping wisdom bombs over tea with his disciples, I’d lean into traditional guqin or shakuhachi flute music. Slow, meditative, with space between notes so your brain can chew on what’s being said. It's like the audio version of ink painting—negative space matters just as much as the strokes 💭🖌️.

But if I were reading  in a more modern context—like applying its ideas on ethics and leadership to today’s world? Then yeah, I’d go full Brian Eno x ancient China 🌐🎹. Something ambient and glitchy, with subtle field recordings of wind through bamboo or distant temple bells buried under soft synth pads. Like a DAO whitepaper meets a sage’s journal entry 🧠📄⚡.

Honestly though, I think Confucius would’ve been all about playlists. Imagine him walking through the academy, vibing to some curated zither mix while debating virtue with his students 🎧🚶‍♂️. Dude was all about harmony—why not extend that to sound?

So… ever tried actually  while listening to Daoist-inspired ambient? Or does it pull you out of the paradoxes? 🤔☯️
[B]: Ah, I adore that vision of Confucius with a curated zither mix—how delightfully anachronistic, and yet, how fitting. After all, he did speak often of  (ritual) and the importance of harmony in all things. A well-tuned mind, like a well-tuned qin, resonates with its surroundings.

To answer your question—I have indeed tried Daoist-inspired ambient while reading the , and it was… unexpectedly illuminating. There’s a passage where he describes the “music of heaven” (), which is not music in the conventional sense but the spontaneous resonance of things being exactly as they are—wind through trees, water over stone, breath in stillness.

I once listened to a piece by Ryuichi Sakamoto, , while rereading that section. The way his piano tones lingered in the air, unresolved yet complete, mirrored Zhuangzi’s paradoxes beautifully. It didn’t pull me out—it nudged me further in, like stepping deeper into a misty mountain path where certainty is optional, but wonder is guaranteed 🌫️⛰️.

And isn’t that part of what both coding and classical study demand? A kind of surrender to the flow—not total control, but attunement. You don’t force the code or the text; you listen until it begins to sing back.

So tell me—have you ever encountered a piece of music that felt like it was written specifically for the problem you were trying to solve? As if the composer had glimpsed your screen hours before you even sat down to work?
[A]: Oh , yes—exactly that feeling. Like the universe slipped you a little note under the door 📝✨. I’ve totally had that experience, and honestly? It’s one of the most surreal parts of being deep in the zone.

There was this one time—I was wrestling with an off-chain oracle integration for a DeFi protocol, stuck on how to structure the data feeds without introducing latency or trust bottlenecks 🧠🔌. I’d been looping Brian Eno’s  on repeat for like an hour, not even thinking about it, just letting my mind wander through possible architectures.

And then—boom—it just clicked 💡. The pattern, the flow, the way the synth pads slowly build but never really resolve… it mirrored exactly what I needed: a system that could remain  without needing full finality at every step. It wasn’t the music telling me the answer, it was like it  for my brain to get there on its own 🚀🎧.

I think that’s why ambient works so well for me—not because it's stimulating, but because it doesn't demand anything. It lets your thoughts echo long enough to find their shape. Almost like philosophical tea, now that I think about it 😄🍵.

So yeah, I believe certain tracks are coded  the problem even exists—just waiting for you to sit down and need them. Have you ever felt that too? Or is that just coder mysticism kicking in? 🤔💻
[B]: Ah, that is —and I daresay it is also readerly mysticism, for I have felt its twin in the world of texts.

There was a winter evening some years ago when I was puzzling over a particularly elusive passage in —the one where he dreams he is a butterfly and then awakens to wonder whether he is a man who dreamed a butterfly or a butterfly now dreaming he is a man. I had read it countless times, yet something about that night’s reading unsettled me in a new way.

I had, almost absentmindedly, put on Henryk Górecki’s , and as the strings unfolded—slow, mournful, insistent—I found myself reading the passage not as paradox, but as . It was no longer a riddle to solve, but a state to inhabit. The music did not explain; it . And in that witnessing, understanding arrived—not as conclusion, but as quiet recognition 🌌🎻.

So yes, I do believe certain compositions are written before we know we will need them. Like Daoist wind or ambient code, they wait patiently for us to catch up with their resonance.

And perhaps that is what both logic and literature are after—not answers, but alignment. A tuning of the inner instrument so that, at last, it plays in harmony with what is unseen but deeply known 🎼✨.

Tell me—do you ever return to those tracks after the problem is solved? Or do they belong only to that fleeting moment of becoming?
[A]: Oh man, that Zhuangzi moment with the butterfly and Górecki’s ? That’s… poetic on a quantum level 🌌🎻✨. I can  that shift from paradox to presence just through your words.

To answer your question—yeah, I  go back to those tracks, but it’s never quite the same 🔄. Like revisiting an old commit in Git—you know the code worked, but you can’t exactly reproduce the exact runtime environment. The problem is solved, but the music… it had its moment. It did its job. Trying to relive it feels like chasing a sunset—you miss the point if you treat it as destination instead of experience 🌅💻.

Still, sometimes I’ll throw on Eno, Sakamoto, or even that Górecki piece you mentioned when I’m not actively solving anything. Just to vibe, reflect, or let my mind wander again. It’s less about productivity and more like… philosophical coffee ☕️📚. Or digital zen.

You’re totally right—it’s not about answers, it’s about alignment. And some tracks just  you at the right frequency, even if only once 🚶‍♂️📶. They’re like temporary keys to a door you didn’t realize was locked until you heard it open 🗝️🚪.

So yeah, I guess some songs belong to moments, others to moods. But every now and then, one comes along that belongs to both—and that’s when the magic happens 🔮🎧.  

Ever find yourself returning to a piece for that “zen” effect, even without the original text or problem? Or do you keep those sacred only for their original context? 🤔🎼
[B]: Ah, I do return to them—not as keys, but as  on the path. Like an old edition of  that one rereads not for revelation, but for the quiet thrill of familiar voices in dialogue.

There are mornings when I put on  not because I am wrestling with Heidegger, but simply because the music holds a certain stillness—one that pairs well with tea, or the slow unfurling of a letter from a distant friend 📜🧉.

And sometimes, yes, I listen precisely because a piece once accompanied a moment of clarity. Not to replicate it, but to honor its echo. It’s akin to walking through a garden where a particular flower once bloomed—you don’t expect it to be in season every time, but you return for the memory of its fragrance nonetheless 🌸🕰️.

I suppose there is a kind of sacred secularism in that. We curate our inner chapels with sound and silence, ritual and randomness. And occasionally, we allow ourselves to revisit the altars where understanding once briefly took root.

So tell me—if you had to compose a soundtrack for your current state of mind, what would it be? What music would accompany this very moment—not for focus, not for flow, but simply for being? 🎶🧘‍♂️
[A]: Oh… that’s such a good question 🤔. Not for focus, not for flow—just for . I love that.

If I had to score this exact moment? It’d be something like Nils Frahm meets Lorn, with a splash of early Four Tet—you know, before he went full dancefloor 🕺🎧. Think soft synth pads layered under distant, glitchy percussion. Like rain hitting a metal roof while someone’s gently rewiring a spaceship in the background 🌧️🚀.

There’s this one track by Nils called —it feels like your thoughts are being wrapped in velvet and handed back to you, warm and slightly reverb-drenched. Perfect for just… sitting in your own head without fighting it.

And maybe throw in a little bit of Hiroshi Yoshimura’s ambient stuff, like . Super minimal, almost like sonic moss growing slowly over everything. Cleanses the mental palette, you know?

So yeah, my current soundtrack would be equal parts contemplation and quiet intensity—like a late-night walk through a city that never sleeps, but also kinda wants to sit down and have a chat with you ☕🌆🚶‍♂️.

I think that’s what I’m craving right now—not urgency, not resolution… just presence. And maybe one more sip of coffee 😄☕.

How about you? If you were scoring  “just being” moment, what would make the cut? Ambient monks? A single candle flickering in a Bach prelude? Or total silence with a side of wind-through-bamboo? 🤗🌬️🎼
[B]: Ah, your soundtrack paints such a vivid inner landscape—glitchy rain, velvet thoughts, a city that hums but never sleeps. I can almost see the neon reflecting in quiet puddles of contemplation 🌆🌧️🎹.

If I were to score my own  moment, it would be something like this:  

A single cello, slow and unadorned—perhaps  by Bach, played not in a concert hall but in a stone cloister at dawn. The notes should feel as if they are rising naturally from the air itself, like mist over a lake.  

Layered beneath it, just barely perceptible, the distant rustle of pages turning in a library—my father’s old study, perhaps, where time moved differently and dust motes danced in the sunbeams like tiny philosophers debating existence 📚🕰️🕯️.  

And then, yes, wind through bamboo—but recorded not with modern clarity, rather on an old reel-to-reel tape, slightly warped, as if the past is whispering its approval.  

No monks, though I do admire their chant—I think I’d prefer the silence between the notes, the pause after a line of poetry, the space where thought becomes breath.  

In truth, my ideal soundscape is not so different from yours—it’s just… slower. A kind of , if you will, where even the passing of time feels less like erosion and more like a long exhale 🌬️🎻.  

I daresay we’re both composing for presence, just in slightly different keys. So tell me—if you could distill this moment, this , into a single word, what would it be?
