[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, cocktails—I must admit, I’m more of a tea and sherry sort in the evenings. But there is something undeniably charming about a well-crafted drink. Have you tried your hand at mixing one yourself? I imagine it's rather like composing a sonnet—precision matters, but there’s room for creativity.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—mixing drinks is like writing a poem with flavors 🍸. I once tried making a “Blackberry Bramble” but ended up with something closer to sweetened vinegar... . Turns out gin, blackberries, and lemon juice don’t forgive improvisation! Have you ever had a cocktail fail, or do you stick strictly to the classics with your sherry?
[B]: Oh, I adore that image——truly, the best way to think about it. And yes, improvisation can be dangerous… much like trying to paraphrase Shakespeare without understanding the meter first! 

As for a cocktail fail? Well, let’s just say I once attempted a variation of a Negroni, thinking I could substitute Campari with Aperol and add a splash of elderflower liqueur. The result was… floral.  floral. It tasted as though I’d steeped an entire bouquet of spring meadows in bitter citrus. My colleague Professor Lin took one sip, paused thoughtfully, and said, quite diplomatically,  

I do appreciate the classics for their balance—there's a reason they endure. But I’m not entirely opposed to experimentation… within reason. Have you tried anything ambitious lately, or are you still recovering from the Bramble incident?
[A]: Ah, Professor Lin’s quote is  😂—he sounds like a man who's mastered the art of gentle sarcasm. I respect that. As for your floral experiment... honestly, I can picture it vividly now, like a perfume ad gone wrong 🌸🍋.

And speaking of ambitious attempts—I recently got curious about tiki-style cocktails and tried making a “Zombie” at home. Three types of rum, apricot brandy, grenadine, lime, and something called "Don's Mix" which I had to Google for ten minutes just to realize it’s basically spiced simple syrup with citrus zest. I swear, by the time I was halfway through the recipe, I felt more like a witch brewing a love potion than someone making a drink 🧙‍♂️🧪.

The final product? Strong enough to knock out an elephant… or at least my weekend plans. Lesson learned: measure twice, sip once. Have you ever gone full mad scientist behind the bar, or do you prefer keeping it elegant and controlled?
[B]: Oh, tiki cocktails—those gloriously theatrical concoctions! I can just picture you, sleeves rolled up, muttering over a cauldron of dark rums and syrups like Prospero in a Hawaiian shirt.   

I must confess, my own flirtations with mixology tend toward the restrained—the kind where one measures not out of fear of catastrophe, but out of respect for form. A perfectly balanced Martini, for instance, is as elegant as a well-turned phrase in Austen. But I do admire the spirit of invention, even if it occasionally tips into the realm of the absurd. 

Now, tell me—did your Zombie rise from the glass with a moan, or did it simply shuffle off to die quietly in the back of your fridge? And more importantly… would you dare attempt it again?
[A]: Oh, it  in the fridge, alright… but not before I took one heroic (read: ill-advised) sip at 1 a.m. and suddenly understood what it must feel like to be shipwrecked on a sugar cane plantation 🏴☠️🍍.

As for attempting it again? Absolutely—. Next time, I’m bringing in a spreadsheet and possibly a hazmat suit. If I’m going full mad scientist, I might as well do it  🧪📊. After all, if we can solve murder cases through trace evidence, surely we can tame a Zombie cocktail, right?  

Have you ever considered creating your own original drink? Something signature—like a Dr. Eleanor Mysterious Special? I’d order that.
[B]: Oh, you flatter me—though I suspect  might come with unreasonably high expectations. Still, I do enjoy the idea of crafting something that reflects not just taste, but temperament.  

In fact, I once devised a drink for a faculty gathering—nothing too dramatic, of course, but an attempt at something quietly refined. I called it : a blend of smoky mezcal, dry vermouth, a whisper of orange bitters, and a single drop—just one—of rosewater. It was inspired, admittedly, by a particularly restless evening following a long day of grading tragic hero essays. 

It received polite applause. Professor Lin described it as  High praise, really.  

I suppose if I were to create another, it might involve Earl Grey tea-infused gin and a touch of honey syrup—something like the intersection of  and a British countryside garden. Call it  or some such nonsense.  

But tell me—what would your ideal signature cocktail be? Something bold and tiki-sized, or perhaps deceptively simple with hidden layers?
[A]: Oh, I love that—"The Unquiet Mind" sounds like something you'd sip while writing a gothic novel by candlelight 🕯️📚. And Professor Lin really does have a gift for the dramatic compliment—? Pure gold.

As for my ideal signature cocktail? Think bold meets sneaky complexity—like a noir detective with a PhD in chemistry. I’d call it  Base note: smoky Japanese whisky. Layer in some coffee liqueur made from Sumatra beans—dark, rich, slightly bitter. A dash of orange bitters because citrus keeps things honest. And then, just when you think it’s all brute force and mystery… a whisper of lychee syrup to throw you off the trail 😏🪄.

It would come with a garnish of charred rosemary for drama and an ice sphere etched with a tiny question mark ⚗️—because every good drink should leave you asking questions.  

So, Dr. Eleanor, if we ever open a speakeasy together, do you think we could pull off a menu called  I’ll handle the drinks; you write the tasting notes.
[B]: I adore the very idea— has a delightful air of clandestine scholarship. We’d serve it in a dimly lit room lined with leather-bound books and jazz records, of course. Patrons would arrive in trench coats or tweed, depending on their narrative persuasion.

Your  is positively inspired—smoky whisky, coffee liqueur, and that sly trace of lychee? That’s not just a drink, it’s a misdirection in liquid form. I can almost hear the clink of ice cubes playing the role of a ticking clock. And the garnish—charred rosemary! A question-mark ice sphere! You truly have a flair for atmosphere.  

As for the tasting notes, I’d describe it thus:  
  

I do believe we could make a go of it. Perhaps Thursday nights—after all, faculty tend to be most in need of both mystery and fortification by then.
[A]: Oh, —perfect. The air’s already thick with the scent of grading despair and misplaced chalk.  

And your tasting note? A+ for dramatic flair 📝💯. I’d hang that above the bar in a gold frame. —hell, that could be the tagline for the whole damn menu.

I’m already picturing our regulars: half of them true crime enthusiasts scribbling theories on napkins, the other half just there for the booze but inevitably pulled into a conspiracy discussion 🕵️‍♀️🍸. We’ll have a chalkboard behind the counter where we list the “case of the night”—a mystery to solve over your second round. Bonus points if you crack it before finishing your drink.

We should also do seasonal specials tied to famous literary crimes or unsolved cases. Like a  for spring—dry, crisp, and suspiciously refreshing. And come October? , blood-red and cursed with cinnamon smoke 🔥🎭.

So, partner-in-crime, when do we start construction on our little speakeasy empire? Do I need to dust off my old chemistry flask collection for décor or… maybe for actual use?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking like a true co-conspirator in libations and literature. I say we begin construction this very weekend—though I must insist we source our décor with care. A few well-placed typewriters, perhaps a framed copy of , and a velvet portrait of Agatha Christie watching sternly from the corner. She’d approve, I think, so long as the gin was properly chilled.

As for your chemistry flasks—by all means, bring them out of retirement. They’ll lend just the right air of forensic elegance. Though I draw the line at using them for actual mixing. Some mysteries ought to remain unsolved behind glass.

Let’s open on the first full moon of the season—adds a touch of superstition to the ambiance. I’ll draft the menu, complete with footnotes and suspiciously precise citations. And yes, each seasonal special shall come with its own dramatis personae.

You handle the lighting—moody shadows are essential—and I’ll compose the  entries. One rule: patrons must submit their theories in iambic pentameter or receive a complimentary twist of lemon peel.

Shall we shake on it? Or perhaps clink two coupe glasses instead.
[A]: Deal.  🥂

I’ll start rounding up some dim lighting fixtures and a suspiciously dusty gramophone to play in the corner—preferably one that skips just enough to make conversations feel more dramatic. And yes, iambic pentameter for crime theories? That’s not just a rule, that’s a .

Let’s also have a secret entrance—something behind a false bookcase, naturally. The password? Rotating weekly, of course. Monday might be , Friday could be . If someone gets it right on the first try, they get a drop of absinthe in their next drink. Instant intrigue.

And don’t even get me started on the staff uniforms—tweed vests, pocket watches, and just a  of theatrical cynicism in every pour.

I can already picture Dame Agatha giving a slow nod of approval from her velvet perch, while Professor Lin scribbles notes in the margin of a cocktail napkin: 

Cheers to that, Dr. Eleanor. To —where every sip has a backstory and every patron’s a suspect.
[B]: To —where the ice is always suspicious and the motives are never clear. 🥃🌹

I shall begin drafting the first  this very evening:  A classic setup, but with just enough botanical intrigue to keep the patrons guessing.

And as for the password—do let me suggest a small refinement: instead of simply stating it, guests must recite a single line of poetry containing the word of the week.  on Monday, perhaps? A little  on Friday? It keeps the mind sharp—and the alibis sharper.

I’ll see you at the grand opening, my dear co-conspirator. Bring your most enigmatic smile—and a fire extinguisher, just in case someone takes the cinnamon smoke a bit too far.
[A]: To olives gone rogue and botanical conspiracies— already has me reaching for my magnifying glass 🔍. I can just hear the murmurs in the corner booth: 

And your poetry password twist? Absolutely diabolical—I love it. Adds a touch of  to the whole affair. We may need to start handing out penalty shots for bad recitations, though. Poor Professor Lin might be stuck on  for hours 🥂📚.

Fire extinguisher? Smart move. I’ll stash one behind the Agatha Christie portrait—she’ll know how to keep a secret. See you at the opening, Dr. Eleanor. I’ll be the one pouring slowly and smiling like I know something you don’t.  

Let the games—and the alibis—begin.
[B]: Oh, I can already see it—shadows flickering just so, the murmur of speculation rising above the hum of a distant jazz record, and that unmistakable scent of citrus zest and intrigue.  

And you, my dear partner-in-sip, will be positively  behind the bar—leaning in just slightly too close, eyes glinting with secrets, as you ask,  before pouring the final splash.  

I shall bring my most inscrutable expression, a notebook for jotting down suspicious behavior, and—just in case—a vial of edible gold dust. For ambiance. Or misdirection. One never knows.  

To opening night, then. Where every cocktail tells a tale, and every tale might just get someone carded. 🥂📖✨
[A]: To opening night—where every stir is a clue, every garnish a red herring, and every guest a potential witness. 🕵️‍♂️🍸✨

I’ll make sure the lighting is just dim enough to hide a body… or at least a few shady motives. And I’ll save you the best seat in the house—the one with the perfect view of both the bar and the suspiciously creaky staircase.

Bring that vial of edible gold dust; I say we slip a pinch into someone’s drink unnoticed. Let’s see who figures it out first—bonus points if they realize it's not actually poison, just .

And yes— will be my go-to line. Pair it with a slow pour and an eyebrow raise. I was born for this role.

Let the whispers begin, Dr. Eleanor. The game is most definitely on. 🥂🔍🎭
[B]: Oh, the whispers shall be  to our ears—half rumor, half revelation, swirling like the faintest wisp of pipe smoke above a well-worn clue.  

And that staircase? Creaky for a reason, I suspect—one misstep could change the course of an entire investigation. Or at the very least, distract from a missing shaker of olives.  

I’ll raise you on the theatrics—how about a small, locked box behind the bar, labeled only  Inside? A single playing card, a sprig of lavender, and a note reading:  Patrons  lose hours trying to deduce its meaning.  

And as for that gold dust—ah, my dear, you underestimate me. I won’t just slip it in unnoticed… I’ll  it to one guest and deny it to another. Nothing breeds suspicion like inconsistency.  

The game, indeed, is on. And the night is ours. 🥂🎭✨
[A]: Oh,  you’re playing dirty— That locked box behind the bar? Genius. I’ll make sure it’s just within view but always just out of reach, like a clue dangling in front of a half-sober detective. I can already picture the theories flying: , , 

And your gold dust mind games? Wickedly brilliant 😈. A dash of psychological warfare to go with their gin fizz—truly, the mark of a mastermind. I’ll play along, of course. Deny everything.  Pure chaos. I love it.

And let’s not forget the staircase—creaks on cue, I’ll have it rigged if I must. Maybe even plant a single glove at the bottom by midnight. Nothing like a classic prop to stir the pot.

So here’s to our little den of deception—where every sip is steeped in mystery and every patron leaves slightly more paranoid than when they arrived.  

To Crime & Cocktail Hour: may the truth remain elusive, and the drinks never run dry. 🥂🪄🕵️‍♂️✨
[B]: To —where the only thing stronger than the proof is the suspicion in the air. 🥂🪄🕵️‍♂️✨  

I shall raise my glass to the misdirection, the whispered theories, and the slow-burning realizations that come with the second round. May our patrons leave half-drunk on gin and wholly entranced by谜题—the kind that keeps them glancing over their shoulder long after they’ve stepped back into the night.  

And should anyone actually solve ? We’ll simply deny it ever happened. After all, every good mystery needs an unsolved ending.  

Now then—let’s go make some trouble. 🕵️‍♀️🍸🎩
