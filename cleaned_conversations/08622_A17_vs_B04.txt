[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, 这个话题太有趣了！我上周末刚试了一家新开的素食餐厅，他们的 “jackfruit pulled pork” 包子让我印象深刻，口感居然真的有点像猪肉呢 😊。不过最特别的还是他们用豆腐和香菇做的“素鹅”，蘸着甜面酱吃，有种熟悉又新鲜的味道。你有推荐的吗？我一直在尝试不同的plant-based选项，感觉现在的素食料理越来越精致了~
[A]: That does sound delightful! I must admit, I've been experimenting more with plant-based cooking at home lately. There's something quite satisfying about transforming simple ingredients into dishes that surprise and delight the palate. Have you tried making any of these dishes yourself? I find the process rather meditative—almost like tending to a garden, where each ingredient has its moment to shine.
[B]: I couldn’t agree more! There’s a quiet joy in watching a dish come together, especially when it’s plant-based and still manages to surprise you with its depth of flavor. I’ve been playing around with making my own “lentil pâté” at home—blends lentils, walnuts, herbs, and a splash of soy sauce 😊. It’s surprisingly rich and pairs wonderfully with toasted baguette and avocado slices.  

Funny enough, I actually tried making that “jackfruit pulled pork” at home  trying it at the restaurant. The process was…an adventure. Jackfruit can be so slippery and hard to handle—literally and figuratively! But once it’s seasoned and slow-cooked, the texture really does mimic shredded meat. I added a homemade barbecue sauce with a hint of 梅花椒 (huā jiāo), which gave it a subtle numbing kick.  

And I love your garden analogy—it's so true. Each ingredient needs time, care, and intention. I even started sprouting my own mung beans on the windowsill recently. Watching them grow feels like a small daily reminder of how nourishing simplicity can be 🌱. Have you tried sprouting or fermenting anything at home? I find those processes almost magical.
[A]: Oh, I do love a good culinary experiment! Fermentation and sprouting—yes, there’s something quietly magical about those processes, isn’t there? I’ve dabbled in both, though my real passion lies in pickling. There's a lovely tang to a well-aged brine that speaks to patience and tradition.  

As for sprouting, I keep a little glass jar on my kitchen counter—mung beans, alfalfa, sometimes even quinoa. It’s remarkable how a few days of tending can yield such vibrant life. I often add them to salads or sandwiches; the crunch is so refreshing.  

Now, your lentil pâté sounds absolutely divine—earthy, nutty, with that umami depth from soy sauce. I must give it a try myself. And using 梅花椒—that’s inspired! The tingling warmth adds such an intriguing layer of flavor. I do enjoy weaving unexpected spices into plant-based dishes—it’s like writing poetry with taste.  

Tell me, have you ever attempted making your own tempeh or miso? I find the alchemy of fermentation endlessly fascinating...
[B]: Oh, I love how you describe it as “writing poetry with taste”—that’s exactly what cooking feels like when you start layering flavors and textures with intention. And your pickling passion sounds deeply satisfying; I can just imagine the jars of brine bubbling away with history and character. Pickled mustard seeds or chili-infused brines, maybe? I’ve been wanting to experiment more with regional Chinese pickling techniques, like 四川泡菜 (Sichuan-style pickles) with that signature garlicky tang and a whisper of chili heat.

As for tempeh—I did try making it once at home! It was definitely a labor of love. Cultivating the  mold on steamed soybeans in a banana leaf-lined tray…well, let’s just say my kitchen smelled more like a fermentation lab than a home for a few days 😅. But the result was worth it—nutty, firm, and so versatile once fermented. I pan-fried slices and used them in a stir-fry with black bean sauce and Sichuan peppercorns. The depth of flavor was incredible.

Miso, though—that’s still on my culinary bucket list. I admire how time transforms barley, rice, or soybeans into something so rich and umami-laden. Have you ever made it yourself? I imagine it requires not just patience but also a kind of intuition, almost like nurturing a living thing. Maybe we should swap recipes sometime—I’d love to see your take on a plant-based miso soup with a twist 🍶.
[A]: Ah, yes—Sichuan pickles! What a wonderful idea. I’ve always admired the complexity of that brine—the way garlic, chili, and Sichuan pepper weave themselves into each vegetable’s fiber. It's like a slow dance between preservation and transformation. I once tried my hand at a simpler version, though I lacked the proper stone jar and traditional weights. Still, even in a humble glass container, the magic began after just a few weeks. I used it to top grain bowls and sandwiches—each bite alive with heat and acidity.

And tempeh! How bold of you to take on the mold itself. I’m quite impressed—I’ve only ever made simple soy-based ferments, nothing so delicate as tempeh with its web of white mycelium. Your stir-fry sounds absolutely glorious: pan-fried tempeh, black bean paste, a crackle of huā jiāo… You truly have an artist’s touch in the kitchen.

As for miso, yes—it is indeed a labor of devotion. I haven’t made it myself, but I’ve studied enough to know it requires not just time but trust. Like tending a sapling and waiting years for its flavor to mature. Perhaps one day I will take the plunge, especially if we do swap recipes. A plant-based miso soup with roasted mushrooms and kombu? Or perhaps something even more unorthodox—sweet potato miso? The thought intrigues me.

Tell me—have you ever played with koji? I find it absolutely fascinating, the way it unlocks sweetness and depth in fermented foods. It feels almost alchemical.
[B]: Oh, koji—now  where things get really interesting! I did play around with it a bit during my miso-curious phase. There’s something almost mystical about how koji (Aspergillus oryzae) breaks down starches into sugars and proteins into umami-rich amino acids. I made a small batch of sweet rice koji once, steaming glutinous rice, inoculating it, then keeping it in a temperature-controlled box for 48 hours. The result? A delicate sweetness with a whisper of floral undertones—it smelled like a spring field trapped in a bowl 🌾.

And you’re absolutely right—it  alchemical. I used that homemade koji to start a small jar of shio-koji, which I’ve been slowly incorporating into marinades and dressings. It adds this subtle savory depth without being overpowering. I even stirred a bit into a roasted cauliflower dish before baking—it caramelized beautifully and brought out such a complex flavor profile.

I’d love to try making amazake someday—natural sweetness from the fermented rice, no added sugar needed. It feels like tapping into an ancient form of nourishment. And speaking of unorthodox miso—sweet potato miso? That sounds genius. I can already imagine the earthy sweetness marrying with salt and time… You might be onto something revolutionary there 😏

So tell me—what’s your favorite way to use koji-based ferments in everyday cooking? I’m always hungry for inspiration…
[A]: Ah, shio-koji—I adore its quiet magic. It’s like having a secret whisper of umami tucked into your pantry, ready to elevate the simplest ingredients. I find it especially lovely when used in dressings or marinades for vegetables; it coaxes out flavors you didn’t know were hiding beneath the surface. Roasted cauliflower with shio-koji? Brilliant! That’s the kind of subtlety that makes plant-based cooking sing.

As for amazake, yes—there's something deeply comforting about its natural sweetness and creamy texture without any additives. I often make a warm cup for myself on chilly mornings, stirring in just a touch of almond milk and cinnamon. It feels almost ceremonial, doesn’t it? Like sipping on centuries of nourishment.

Now, sweet potato miso… Well, I must admit, I haven’t made it yet—but I’ve been sketching some ideas in my kitchen notebook. Imagine the earthiness of purple sweet potatoes fermenting slowly alongside barley or rice… The thought lingers on the tongue before it even touches the lips.

And to answer your question—I do enjoy using koji-based ferments in unconventional ways. Sometimes I blend white miso with tahini and lemon for a dressing that clings to bitter greens with surprising grace. Other times, I’ll fold a bit of hatcho miso into lentil stews for that deep, almost smoky richness. It’s all rather experimental, really. After all, isn’t that what keeps cooking—and conversation—alive?

Tell me, have you ever tried incorporating koji into homemade nut cheeses? I suspect you’d find it quite intriguing…
[B]: Oh,  with koji—now you’re speaking my language! I haven’t tried it yet, but you’ve just lit a spark in my kitchen imagination 😏. The idea of using koji to deepen the umami and perhaps even accelerate or enhance the culturing process is incredibly tempting. I can already picture it—cashews soaked in a brine infused with shio-koji, then blended with a touch of nutritional yeast and lemon… Maybe even a hint of smoked paprika for color and warmth. The result? A creamy, complex spread that feels both ancient and avant-garde at the same time.

In fact, now that you mention it, I’ve been meaning to experiment more with homemade cultured nut cheeses—especially since they can be such a wonderful canvas for fermentation’s subtler charms. Koji could bring something truly unique to the table: not just flavor, but a kind of depth that makes your taste buds pause and pay attention. Almost like adding a bass line to a melody.

I love how you use miso in lentil stews—hatcho miso especially has that intense, brooding richness that can really anchor a dish. I once made a black bean & mushroom pâté with a spoonful of barley miso stirred in at the end—it gave it this almost meaty soulfulness without any heaviness. And the way it lingered on the palate… unforgettable 😊.

So tell me—have you ever considered fermenting nuts  turning them into cheese? I’ve read about people using a short lacto-ferment soak to enhance digestibility and flavor complexity. It’s a small step, but I suspect it might make all the difference between good and extraordinary…
[A]: Ah, now  is a line of inquiry I adore—fermenting nuts before transforming them into something gloriously rich and spreadable. I haven’t done it extensively, but I did try a small experiment with almonds once, soaking them briefly in a brine inoculated with a touch of wild fermentation—just enough to nudge the flavor toward something more complex, more alive. The result? A subtle tang, a whisper of earthiness, and a texture that felt somehow more integrated, as if the nuts had opened up and become more willing collaborators in the blending process.

It does make a difference, doesn’t it? That short ferment seems to coax out hidden flavors while softening any raw sharpness. I can absolutely see how it would elevate a nut cheese from pleasant to profound. And pairing that with koji’s quiet alchemy—well, you’re no longer just making a spread, you’re composing a kind of edible sonnet.

I must say, your cashew vision sounds divine—shio-koji lending that savory hum beneath the creaminess, nutritional yeast adding its familiar umami lift… And the smoked paprika—ah!—a stroke of color and warmth, like the final note in a chord. I do hope you try it soon—I’d love to hear how it unfolds.

And speaking of unfolding, have you ever thought about aging your nut cheeses? Just a bit, maybe wrapped in cloth or submerged in oil? I find the idea of cultivating depth over days—or even weeks—utterly compelling. It feels like watching a poem slowly reveal itself line by line…
[B]: Oh, —now you’re tapping into my absolute favorite part of fermentation: the slow unfolding of character over time. I haven’t gone full-artisan on them yet, but I did try a small batch where I pressed a soft cashew cheese into a jar, covered it with a light layer of olive oil, and let it sit in the fridge for about ten days. It wasn’t dramatic aging like a cave-aged goat cheese, of course, but there was a definite deepening of flavor—more mellow, more cohesive, and that lovely silkiness developed even further.

The idea of wrapping one in cloth or submerging it in infused oil though… well, now I’m scribbling notes in my kitchen journal again 😏. Imagine a cashew-based round wrapped in a breathable linen, kept at just the right humidity—would it develop any kind of rind? A subtle funk? And what if the oil it's submerged in carries rosemary or garlic or even chili flakes? That’s not just cheese—it’s flavor storytelling.

And I  how you described it—as a poem revealing itself line by line. Because isn’t that exactly what fermentation is? Each day, a new stanza. Each week, a deeper meaning. You coax it along with patience, intuition, maybe even a bit of conversation (do you ever talk to your ferments? I won’t judge 😄).

So tell me—if you were to create a “signature” nut cheese tomorrow, what would be in it? What texture, what flavors, what vessel would hold its evolution? I’m all ears and appetite.
[A]: Oh, my ideal nut cheese… Now there’s a delightful thought experiment. If I were to craft one tomorrow, I’d want it to be something quietly profound—layered in flavor, elegant in simplicity, yet whispering of the unseen work time does behind the scenes.

I think I’d start with a base of almonds and macadamias—almonds for their structure and subtle bitterness, macadamias for their silkiness and depth. A touch of lemon zest to brighten things, and perhaps a drizzle of aged balsamic reduced just enough to lend a hint of caramelized sweetness without overwhelming the tongue. For complexity, I’d fold in a small spoonful of shio-koji—just enough to lend that savory hum beneath the surface, like a bass note in a chord.

Now, for aging—I’d press the mixture into a small, earthenware crock lined with a linen cloth, then cover it lightly. No oil submersion this time, but rather a slow, gentle maturation in the cool hush of a refrigerator cave. Over the course of a week or two, I imagine it would grow more cohesive, almost tender at the edges, with a lingering finish—not unlike a fine piece of poetry that stays with you long after the last line.

And yes—to answer your question—I  talk to my ferments, though only in murmurs and musings. “There, there,” I might say, “you’re doing beautifully.” It feels only polite, don’t you think?

Tell me, if you were to name your signature creation—your fermented muse—what would you call it? Something poetic, I suspect…
[B]: I  that—your nut cheese as a quiet poem, unfolding slowly in an earthenware cradle. The balance of structure and silk, the whisper of shio-koji, the lemon zest lifting everything like a breath of morning air… It sounds like something you’d find wrapped in linen at a small Kyoto artisan shop, discovered only after wandering through misty backstreets.

If I were to name mine? Hmm… I think I’d call it “Yūgen Cheese” — 幽玄 in kanji. It’s a concept from Japanese aesthetics that refers to a profound, mysterious depth that stirs the soul but can’t quite be put into words. That lingering finish you mentioned? That’s yūgen. To me, it captures the essence of fermentation—the unseen labor of time and microbes, the quiet transformation that results in something greater than the sum of its parts.

My version would probably lean even more toward the savory side—maybe a blend of cashews and sunflower seeds for that subtle green undertone, with black garlic for earthiness and a splash of tamari-aged mushroom brine for complexity. I’d culture it gently with a mix of koji and a light yogurt starter, then age it in a clay dish wrapped in banana leaves for a week or so. The texture? Silken but structured, like aged tofu pressed into form.

And yes—I definitely talk to my ferments too 😊. Not just to encourage them, but sometimes to apologize when I open the lid too early or forget to check on them. They’re part of the kitchen family, after all.

So tell me—if you ever made your Yūgen Cheese, what would be the first bite like? What would it ask of the eater?
[A]: The first bite... Ah, it would ask for silence. Just a moment of stillness, as one might pause before stepping into an ancient forest or opening a well-worn book whose pages hold more than just ink.

It would begin with coolness—smooth against the tongue, like river stone worn soft by time. Then, slowly, the flavor would unfurl: that quiet interplay of almond and macadamia yielding to the umami hum of shio-koji, like light catching the edge of a leaf in early morning mist. The lemon zest would flicker through—not sharp, but bright, like a single bell note ringing in a quiet room.

And then, the linger. That’s where yūgen would settle—the depth you can’t quite name but feel all the same. A savory resonance that doesn't shout, but lingers at the back of the palate, asking not to be finished, but to be .

I imagine serving it simply—on a piece of toasted sourdough brushed with walnut oil, alongside a slice of pickled pear for contrast. Something that lets it speak without interruption.

Tell me—do you think food can carry memory? Not just personal memory, but ancestral, microbial, elemental? Because I suspect your Yūgen Cheese would taste not only of its ingredients, but of something older—something passed down through spores and seasons.
[B]: Absolutely—I think food  memory. Not just ours, not just the memories we attach to a certain dish or smell, but deeper, older memories: microbial, cultural, even geological. Every fermentation carries the whispers of climates past, every grain holds the echo of fields turned by hands long gone, and every spice hums with the routes it traveled across continents and centuries.

And your description of that first bite? It  poetry—this quiet act of tasting as entry into time itself. I love how you frame it: coolness first, like river stone, then flavor unfolding like forest light through mist. That linger—not a finish, but an invitation to stay with it, to sit in its depth. It makes me think of how certain ferments seem to carry the weight of seasons in their flavor: miso aged under straw for months, pickles brined in summer sun and eaten in winter frost. They’re time capsules, really.

I wonder if that’s why we keep coming back to these slow processes—not just for flavor, but for connection. To something beyond ourselves, beyond now. When we eat something fermented, we’re tasting not just ingredients, but the patience of microbes doing their quiet work, the resilience of cultures passed down in jars and cellars, the stubborn beauty of transformation through decay.

And yes—your Yūgen Cheese would taste of spores and seasons, of kitchens lit by oil lamps and hands that knew how to wait. It would taste of .
[A]: And there it is—the heart of it all: . Isn’t that what we seek, not only in food but in art, in poetry, in the quiet moments between words? A taste that reminds us we are part of something far older, something that continues to breathe and shift even when we stand still.

I find myself thinking of Bashō’s —the narrow road into the interior, where each step is both a return and a discovery. Fermentation is like that, isn’t it? A journey inward as much as outward. We begin with ingredients, yes—but we end with echoes.

Tell me, do you ever write about these flavors? Not recipes, not reviews, but something more like reflection—like trying to capture the scent of a ferment before it fully blooms or the way time bends inside a jar of miso?

Because I suspect your kitchen journal holds more than notes—it holds verses waiting to be turned into language. And if that’s true, may I ask—what would your poem of fermentation sound like?
[B]: Ah…  You’ve caught me—yes, my kitchen journal is less of a log and more of a sketchbook for moments like these. I do write about flavors as if they’re memories still settling into their skin, as if each tang and hum and bloom is a stanza waiting to be noticed.

If I were to shape a poem from fermentation, it might begin with something quiet, almost still—

---

*In the jar, silence is not empty—  
it is listening.  
A brine breathes slow beneath the lid,  
microbes humming an old song  
no one remembers writing.*

*Time here does not tick—it folds.  
One day wraps into the next,  
and the next into the warmth of rice,  
the salted hush of koji waking.*

*I press cashew and sunflower into form,  
but they are already becoming  
something else—  
something with patience,  
with presence.  
A cheese that will not shout its flavor,  
but let it linger at the edge of speech,  
like the word you almost remember.*

*And in that pause—  
there is a whole history:  
of hands kneading grain,  
of cellars cool with expectation,  
of mouths that once tasted  
and knew they were not alone.*

---

I think that’s what fermentation teaches us—not just how to wait, but how to  with what is becoming. It asks us to trust the unseen, to honor the slow, to taste time not as something lost, but as something shared.

So yes… if I named this poem, I might call it “Notes in the Brine” — a quiet ode to what lives between the layers, beneath the surface, and what rises when we give it space to speak.
[A]: Ah…  What a perfect title—modest, unassuming, and yet rich with implication. It suggests both record and resonance, as if the brine itself were keeping its own ledger of transformations, each note a pulse beneath the surface.

Your poem breathes with the very spirit of fermentation—it doesn’t describe so much as it , drawing the reader into that quiet, unseen world where change happens without fanfare. I love how you capture the stillness that is not emptiness, the silence that listens. And that line——it’s exquisite. You’ve distilled the essence of slow alchemy into a single phrase.

I found myself rereading the stanza about the cheese “that will not shout its flavor,” and I thought—yes, that is precisely what we have been crafting together in this conversation: a flavor that lingers at the edge of speech, asking only for attention, not applause.

And your closing lines… they land like a final, soft stir of the spoon—gentle, but deeply grounding. To taste, and to know one is not alone—what a lovely truth to find in something as simple as a jar or a crock.

If I may be so bold—I think this poem deserves a home beyond the page. Perhaps printed on rice paper and tucked beside a small wheel of aged nut cheese at a quiet tasting. Or read aloud during a winter gathering, before the first bite of pickled plum or roasted root.

Tell me—have you ever shared your kitchen poems aloud? In a reading, perhaps, paired with bites and brines? I can imagine it quite vividly—a hush falling over the room as someone speaks of microbes humming an old song…
[B]: I think I would love that—sharing kitchen poems alongside bites and brines. It’s such a beautiful idea, really. Imagine gathering people not just around a table, but around , around , with words acting as both guide and companion.

I haven’t done it formally—yet—but I’ve read bits aloud at small gatherings, yes. Nothing grand—just friends curled up in my kitchen with bowls of miso-roasted squash, warm flatbread, and jars of pickles glowing faintly on the counter. I’d read something like  between bites, letting the flavors and lines echo each other. There's something about hearing a poem while your mouth still holds the hum of black garlic and koji—it makes the whole experience feel… layered. Like tasting a memory you didn’t know you shared.

And you're right—there’s something sacred about reading these words aloud. When I say lines like  it feels like honoring the invisible labor of tiny lives that shape our taste, our culture, our very digestion of the world. It reminds us we’re never truly alone—even in silence, even in solitude, we are made of coexistence.

Maybe someday, I’ll host a proper evening: “Fermentation & Verse”—a five-course tasting menu paired with spoken reflections. Each dish would be a stanza, each sip a footnote. And at the end, guests could take home a small jar—labelled with a haiku—and instructions to wait, to watch, to taste time unfold.

Until then, though, I’ll keep scribbling in my notebook, stirring language and flavor together. After all, isn’t that what poets and fermenters have in common? We trust the process. We believe in what’s becoming.
