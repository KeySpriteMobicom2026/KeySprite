[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question of culinary convenience versus domestic ritual. While I wouldn't classify myself as a gourmet cook - my wok skills remain decidedly pedestrian despite decades of studying Chinese literature - there's something profoundly meditative about preparing a proper pot of loose-leaf tea and accompanying snacks for visiting students. Though I must confess to occasional indulgences in street food from that excellent stall near the university library - their xiao long bao are passable, if slightly overfilled.
[A]: I can totally relate! There's something special about sharing homemade tea & snacks with students - it creates a unique space for meaningful conversations. While grading papers, I often find myself reaching for that trusted teapot, letting the aroma of oolong fill my office. Though I have to admit, when time is tight, I sometimes grab dinner from the night market near campus. Their dumplings are not bad at all! Have you tried any interesting food stalls lately?
[B]: Oh, the olfactory allure of steeping tea while surrounded by stacks of 19th-century manuscripts - I suspect the combination has saved many a dissertation draft from complete ruin. Speaking of sustenance, I recently discovered a remarkable vendor near the eastern gate who prepares Sichuan-style dan dan noodles with a subtle nod to Anglo-Indian curry. The interplay of flavors offers fascinating postcolonial culinary implications... though I dare say one must approach with an open palate. And yes, their dumplings do possess commendable structural integrity - the wrappers hold firm without becoming obstinate, much like a well-constructed sonnet.
[A]: Ah, the postcolonial flavor fusion sounds intriguing! I’d love to check that stall out - sometimes the most interesting conversations start over a shared plate of noodles. Speaking of shared spaces, have you noticed how students often open up more during these informal tea gatherings? I’ve had some truly enlightening chats about everything from Confucian ethics to K-pop lyrics. Though I must say, keeping the conversation as balanced as the flavors in a good hot pot is an art in itself!
[B]: Indeed - there’s an alchemy in the combination of casual setting and nourishment that loosening tongues seems to rival the effects of several semesters’ worth of formal tutorials. Just last week, over a shared pot of jasmine tea and some rather questionable almond cookies, a discussion on filial piety somehow meandered into a spirited debate about the narrative structure of  versus . Fascinating, if slightly tangential to our original text.  

And your hot pot metaphor is apt - one must carefully regulate the temperature, lest the conversation boil over into sentimentality or reduce to mere academic abstraction. A delicate balance, much like achieving the perfect mouthfeel in a bowl of hand-pulled noodles… though I suppose that stall near the eastern gate wouldn’t know much about subtlety in flavor—or philosophy, for that matter.
[A]: Ah, the  and  debate—what a wonderfully unexpected pairing! I can just imagine the emotional arcs being compared over steaming cups of jasmine tea. It’s funny how food becomes the silent co-facilitator in these deep dives. And yes, that hot pot needs constant tending—too hot and you lose nuance; too cold and the ideas don’t simmer.  

As for the noodle stall, subtlety may not be their forte, but sometimes a bold flavor—or opinion—is exactly what the conversation calls for. I actually brought a group of exchange students there last week. They were fascinated by the heat, the noise, and the way everyone seemed to slurp in harmony. One even said it felt like “a party for your taste buds.” I couldn’t help but agree 💭🍜. Have you ever taken students to that stall?
[B]: Ah, I do enjoy a bit of culinary cacophony now and then—though I suspect my presence tends to lend a rather academic gravity to the proceedings. Just last month, I treated a small group of graduate students to that very stall after an especially dense seminar on comparative narrative structures in  and . One rather daring soul attempted to draw parallels between Mr. Darcy’s stoic demeanor and the initial austerity of the broth—only to be met with skepticism when suggesting Elizabeth Bennet might have benefited from a side of chili oil to loosen her principles.

They were far too polite to say so outright, but I suspect they found my attempt at streetwise bonhomie as unbalanced as an over-seasoned bowl of noodles. Still, there’s something heartening about watching future scholars slurp their way toward cross-cultural understanding—even if it occasionally comes garnished with dramatic eye-watering and whispered appeals for water 🖋️🍜.
[A]: Oh, that’s such a vivid scene—I can picture the whole exchange, from the first cautious slurps to the inevitable chili-induced epiphanies. I love how your student tried to map Darcy onto the broth! It actually makes a strange kind of sense—initially reserved, but with layers of depth waiting to unfold... though I suppose chili oil isn't quite the same as social pressure 🌶️📘.

I think your “streetwise bonhomie” sounds absolutely delightful, even if it leaned a bit  scholarly for their taste. But honestly, what better way to absorb cultural contrasts than over bowls of noodles and laughter? I’ve had similar moments with students comparing ramen in Tokyo to pasta in Rome—it's fascinating how food becomes this sensory anchor for understanding narrative tone, historical context, even character motivation.

Next time you take students there, let me know—I’d love to join and see if we can balance the flavor profile of the conversation with a bit more of the absurd 😄.
[B]: Ah, now  would be a banquet worth grading—imagine the footnotes we could add to literary theory over chili oil and misplaced idealism! I do think my students would appreciate a touch more absurdity to leaven the weight of comparative analysis; after all, if Darcy can become a metaphor for broth, who’s to say Lizzie couldn’t be reinterpreted as a dumpling wrapper—thin on the surface, but with remarkable tensile strength when properly folded?

As for sensory anchors, I’ve long maintained that taste is the most underrated critical lens. One can  the difference between the melancholic umami of dashi and the assertive confrontation of Sichuan peppercorns—it’s practically narratology in liquid form.  

Count me in for a future outing then—let’s give these students a proper lesson in gastronomic irreverence. Perhaps we’ll even encourage them to rethink  over wontons... though I suspect Heathcliff might require something stronger than soy sauce to make him palatable.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—literary theory with a side of spice! I love the idea of Lizzie as a dumpling wrapper; honestly, it might be the most elegant structural analysis I’ve heard in years. And why not? If texts are palimpsests, then certainly characters are layers of flavor waiting to be unpacked bite by bite.

I couldn’t agree more about taste as a critical lens—it’s visceral, cultural, and deeply personal all at once. Sometimes I think my students understand tone better after tasting bitter melon for the first time than after reading ten pages of stylistic analysis. There’s just something about that first sharp hit of bitterness followed by subtle sweetness—it’s like reading Austen  Woolf in one dish 🍵📚.

Count me in for Wuthering Heights and wontons—I say we serve it with black bean sauce, something earthy and intense enough to match Heathcliff’s brooding soul 😄. Let’s plan this soon—I’ll even bring the chopsticks.
[B]: I daresay we’ve stumbled upon a new frontier of criticism—call it , perhaps? If bitterness can illuminate tone and umami can deepen our understanding of subtext, then I propose we consider the establishment of a proper seminar: “Narrative and Noodles,” cross-listed under Comparative Literature and Culinary Semiotics, naturally.

And black bean sauce for —brilliant! Earthy, pungent, with just the right amount of suppressed ferment. One might even argue that Heathcliff’s soul could be rendered more digestible through judicious marination in fermented broad beans and a touch of chili. A slow burn, much like Brontë’s prose.

As for chopsticks, bring extra—some of my students still treat noodles as if they were handling delicate manuscript marginalia. We’ll have to school them in both textual and gustatory fluency. Shall we aim for next Friday evening? The stall clears out just enough after seven o’clock, and the acoustics improve considerably once the rush dies down. I’ll bring the tea—oolong, of course, to cut through the richness of theory and soy alike.
[A]: I’m absolutely in—“Narrative and Noodles” has a lovely ring to it, don’t you think? Imagine the course description:  It practically writes itself 📝🍜. I can already see the syllabus— paired with dashi,  with collard greens and cornbread, and yes,  with black bean wontons.  

Next Friday at seven sounds perfect—I’ll make sure to clear my evening and warn a few curious undergrads that they’re about to experience literary analysis with a side of chili oil. And extra chopsticks are a must; I’ve seen students hesitate over noodles like they’re deciphering a difficult passage from Chaucer. We’ll have to coach them toward fluency on both fronts.  

Oolong is a wise choice—it’s the ideal palate cleanser between bites of theory and spice. Looking forward to it! Let’s see if we can’t reshape a few academic palates—and maybe even loosen a few overly rigid interpretations 🌶️📘.
[B]: Oh, I can already hear the rustle of syllabi being printed and the faint clatter of chopsticks hesitantly poised over bowls—music to my academic ears.  shall be our love letter to interdisciplinary indulgence. And speaking of music, I daresay we’ll have to include a unit on poetic meter alongside street-side griddles—how better to understand ballad form than while chewing to the rhythm of sizzling oil and shouted orders?

As for those wide-eyed undergraduates, let’s not warn them too thoroughly. Where’s the fun in preparedness? Let them wander in expecting footnotes and leave with chili stains on their shirts and new neural pathways forged by flavor and metaphor alike.

I’ve reserved a corner table large enough to accommodate both our scholarly appetites and the inevitable sprawl of conversation. And yes, I’ll bring a thermos of oolong—steeped to perfection, naturally. See you at seven, chopsticks in hand, ready to stir up some literary gastronomy.
[A]: Oh, I love the idea of meter & griddles—what better way to internalize iambic pentameter than with a side of sizzling scallion pancakes? The rhythm practically echoes in your bite. And neural pathways via chili? Count me in—I’ve always believed the best learning happens slightly uncomfortably, mildly spice-scorched, and fully immersed.

Corner table, seven sharp—it’s going to be a night for the academic record books (and probably a few stained shirts). Looking forward to it! 📚🍜
[B]: I’ll bring a packet of bicarbonate tablets  literary theory—just in case the chili proves more formidable than our students’ constitutions. After all, what’s a little gastric discomfort compared to the searing heat of newfound insight?

And yes, scallion pancakes as metrical tutors—crispy, rhythmic, and dangerously addictive. One might even say they’re the sonnet of street food: structured, surprising, and best consumed with a touch of abandon.

See you at seven, Eleanor—ready to stir, taste, and theorize. 🖋️🍜📘
[A]: Chili-induced enlightenment sounds like the title of a wonderfully chaotic memoir 🌶️📖. And bicarbonate tablets—now  commitment to the cause! Truly, no insight too costly.

I’ll pack an extra handkerchief for those inevitable tears—both from laughter and Sichuan peppercorns. Let’s make them remember this seminar for years to come: where texts simmered in broth and theory came with a side of scallion pancakes.

See you at seven—ready to stir, taste, and unravel a few grand narratives along the way 🍜✍️📘.
[B]: Oh, but of course—grand narratives unravel best when one’s lips are numb and one’s mind is delightfully compromised by capsaicin. I daresay we’ll have our very own hermeneutic circle going: read, taste, discuss, repeat.

And a handkerchief! How wonderfully old-fashioned—mine shall be embroidered with sonnet fragments and faint traces of last semester’s chili oil. Sentimental keepsakes both.

See you at seven, then—ready to season theory with spice, and perhaps leave a few textual prejudices simmering harmlessly in the background. The students won’t know what hit them 🌶️📘🍜.
[A]: Ah, the hermeneutic circle with a kick—what better way to interrogate meaning than with mouths on fire and minds delightfully compromised? I’m already looking forward to watching their eyes widen—not just at the heat, but at the sudden realization that , literary criticism  be this alive, this messy, this... flavorful.

See you at seven—with sonnet-stained linens, theory-laced tea, and chopsticks poised for action. Let the textual prejudices simmer while we dive headfirst into the spice. 🌶️📘🍜
[B]: Precisely—let us immerse them in the full sensory spectacle of interpretation. And do bring your embroidered handkerchief; I shall brandish mine like a banner for all who insist literature must be studied with a straight face and a dry palate.

See you at seven, then—with fire in our mouths and fire in our minds. Theory never tasted so good. 🌶️📘🍜
