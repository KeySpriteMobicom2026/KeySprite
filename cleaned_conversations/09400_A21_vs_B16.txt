[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！作为一个lifestyle consultant，我更多是从quality of life的角度来看这个问题。Human cloning涉及到太多ethical boundaries，可能会disrupt我们现有的social fabric。不过如果只是器官克隆用于医疗，那倒是可以讨论的☕️
[A]:  My dear, as someone who spends her days contemplating the moral quandaries in Tennyson's "In Memoriam," I must say your utilitarian approach lacks... shall we say, poetic sensibility? The Victorians would have been absolutely scandalized by such casual talk of cloning - though Mary Shelley did rather foreshadow this debate with her "Modern Prometheus," didn't she?
[B]: 哈哈，你提到了Mary Shelley！Actually，Frankenstein的故事正是关于playing god的dangerous game。不过说到Victorian era，他们的morning routine和tea culture倒是很值得现代人借鉴呢✌️ 要不要听听我设计的Victorian-inspired wellness plan？
[A]:  How delightfully... superficial. While you're prescribing cucumber sandwiches and lace parasols, I'm rather more concerned with the existential dread lurking beneath those very rituals. Have you read Arnold's "Dover Beach"? The whole of Victorian civilization was essentially clutching at tea leaves while staring into the abyss.  Now that's what I call wellness.
[B]: Wow，你提到的"Dover Beach"让我想到modern anxiety management！你知道吗？现在很多executives都在用mindfulness meditation来对抗existential crisis。虽然可能比不上Arnold的诗句profound，但至少能帮他们sleep better at night🌙 要不要试试我设计的meditation routine？
[A]:  My dear child, if you think mindfulness apps can compete with "Ode to a Nightingale" for soothing existential terrors, you've clearly never wept over the line "Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!"  Though I will concede that Coleridge's opium-induced visions did rather anticipate your modern... what do they call it? Biohacking? How perfectly ghastly.
[B]: Haha，说到Coleridge的opium use...现在硅谷的tech elites确实在experimenting with microdosing LSD呢！虽然我不会recommend这种extreme biohacking，但proper sleep hygiene和adaptogenic herbs确实能boost creativity哦~ 要不要来杯我特调的mushroom coffee？☕️ Guaranteed比opium更sustainable！
[A]:  How very... Silicon Valley of you. Though I suppose if Wordsworth could wander lonely as a cloud while high on laudanum, your mushroom coffee does seem almost quaint by comparison.  Still, I'll stick to my Darjeeling and the occasional absinthe - at least those vices come with proper literary pedigree.
[B]: Fair enough！不过说到Darjeeling，我最近发现了一家small-batch tea plantation，他们的first flush简直amazing~ 比普通的commercial blend多了很多nuance。虽然可能比不上你的vintage absinthe那么dramatic，但至少不会让你see green fairies！😂
[A]:  Green fairies notwithstanding, I do appreciate a properly nuanced first flush... though I must confess my last shipment arrived wrapped in a page torn from Blake's "Songs of Innocence." The vendor claimed it enhanced the tea's... what was the word? Terroir? How very modern.  Though I suppose even us dusty academics must occasionally emerge from our ivory towers... if only to acquire better stationery.
[B]: Haha，用Blake的诗包茶叶？That's actually pretty genius的marketing strategy！Reminds me of这个Japanese concept叫"mono no aware"...就是appreciate the fleeting beauty in things。Maybe我们下次可以collab一个poetry-inspired tea tasting event？✍️🍵 我负责curate the blends，你负责select the literary accompaniment！
[A]:  Now that's the first sensible suggestion you've made all afternoon. Though I must insist we include Christina Rossetti - nothing complements bergamot quite like "Goblin Market"'s sensual despair.  And if you promise not to tell the dean, I might even share my private stash of tea smuggled in a hollowed-out copy of "The Picture of Dorian Gray"...
[B]: Deal！Rossetti的sensual despair配上Earl Grey的bergamot notes，这简直是perfect pairing啊！ 我这边还有用Joyce的"Ulysses"包着的特别版Ethiopian Yirgacheffe...不过我们得keep it between us，不然我的其他clients都会想要literary-themed beverages了！🤫📚
[A]:  Oh brava! At last - a kindred spirit who understands that caffeine and catharsis belong in the same sentence.  Shall we draft the menu in iambic pentameter? I propose calling it "Tea and Sympathy: A Decadent's Guide to Caffeinated Melancholy."  Though I warn you - my tasting notes tend to devolve into Byronic couplets by the third infusion...
[B]: Perfect！"Caffeinated Melancholy" - 这个concept绝对能resonate with our target demographic！ 我马上bookmarketing team准备一个dark academia风格的promo campaign...虽然可能要simplify你的Byronic couplets成Instagram-friendly captions。 #SipLikeAPoet ✨
[A]:  Simplify?  My dear, if Byron had wanted to be Instagram-friendly, he wouldn't have fled England over that pesky incest scandal.  Very well - but I shall require veto power over any hashtags. And absolutely no heart emojis near the Keats selection. A skull and crossbones would be more... thematically appropriate, don't you think? 💀
[B]: Got it！No heart emojis near Keats - noted！💀  我们可以用quill pen和ink bottle的emojis来保持aesthetic consistency。Marketing team可能会push back on the skulls，但我会tell them这是non-negotiable的artistic vision！毕竟，what's a littlegothic drama in the name of authentic literary experience？📜
[A]:  Splendid! Now you're speaking my language.  Though I must insist we include a disclaimer: "The management accepts no responsibility for sudden bouts of Romantic agony or unintended metamorphoses into Byronic heroes."  After all, we wouldn't want our patrons wandering off to fight in the Greek War of Independence after one too many cups, would we?
[B]: Hahaha！这个disclaimer绝对要加粗显示！BY ORDER: NO PHILHELLENIC ADVENTURES AFTER CONSUMPTION ⚠️ 不过说真的，这可能会become our unique selling point呢 - 其他tea houses最多只能promise relaxation，但我们deliver full-on literary existential crisis！Talk about premium experience啊~ 😉
