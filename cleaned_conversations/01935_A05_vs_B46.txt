[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say there's something magical about holding a physical script, the smell of paper, the way it feels in your hands... But hey, don't get me wrong - I've embraced e-readers for their convenience when traveling. What about you? Do you find one more inspiring than the other for storytelling?
[A]: I know exactly what you mean. There's an irreplaceable  charm in flipping physical pages — maybe that’s why I still keep a hardcover copy of  on my desk. But let’s be real, when I’m on a flight to Singapore or Shenzhen, my Kindle becomes the MVP. It’s just easier to carry 10 books in one device. 

As for storytelling, I actually find both formats equally inspiring. The medium doesn’t really matter if the narrative hooks you in — whether it’s a startup pitch or a memoir. Though I have to say, sometimes the weight of a well-bound book does add a bit more , don’t you think? 😊
[B]: Oh, absolutely - that weight does matter! When I was producing , we had stacks of hardcovers lying around the set. The actors kept them on their desks, flipped through actual pages during takes... it just added another layer of authenticity. 

You know, I still have my original copy of  from the ‘80s — dog-eared, coffee-stained, and proudly displayed next to my  script. It’s like holding a piece of narrative history. But hey, don’t tell anyone — I sneak in e-books during long flights too. Old habits die hard, but convenience? That’s a silent killer.  

Startup pitch or memoir — you’re right, the hook is what grabs you. Though I do love how a well-designed hardcover can elevate a story’s presence. Almost like casting the perfect actor for a role...
[A]: Oh, I totally get that — there’s something about having a physical copy of  that just  you in the era it describes. Like holding a time capsule of Wall Street madness. And I can picture your set perfectly — all those real books bringing texture to the storytelling. Authenticity really does start with the details. 👍

I’m the same — my old copy of  is practically falling apart, but I wouldn’t replace it for anything. It’s got character. Though I admit, when I’m on a 14-hour flight to London or Frankfurt, I quietly switch to my e-reader and binge-read industry reports like they’re Netflix episodes. 📊😅

And I love what you said about a hardcover being like casting the right actor — so true! The right cover, the right font, the weight — it all sets the tone before you even read the first line. Still, at the end of the day, if the story doesn’t hook me in the first few pages — paper or digital — I swipe left. Just like dating apps, right? 😊
[B]: Haha, swipe left — now  modern criticism! You’re absolutely right though. I’ve judged more manuscripts by their covers than I’d like to admit — same with actors’ headshots, come to think of it.  

Funny you mentioned  — that dog-eared copy of mine survived three moves across the country and still rides shotgun in my office. It's like a trophy from the greed-is-good era. And yeah, on those brutal transatlantic flights? I’m buried in analytics too, flipping through reports like some finance-world binge watcher. 📈

But here’s what really gets me — when a book  like a film treatment. That moment you read the first paragraph and just  it’s cinematic. No e-reader can fake that spark. Still, don’t tell my tech-savvy producers I said that — they’ll stage a mutiny. 😅
[A]: Oh, I’m with you 100% — that  is everything. It’s like when you hear a startup pitch and halfway through you’re already mentally drafting the term sheet. There’s just  moment when you know — this is going to stick. And yeah, no e-reader can replicate that gut punch of a great opening line. Although my younger analysts would probably mutiny if I went full Luddite on them too. 😅

And I love what you said about judging manuscripts like headshots — so true! First impressions matter, whether it’s a book or a casting call. Though honestly, I’ve stuck with some pretty rough covers if the writing was strong enough. Kind of like actors — sometimes the best ones don’t look like stars at first glance.  

By the way, I need to ask — have you ever come across a memoir or business book that felt so cinematic you couldn’t  picture it on screen? I’ve been reading a few lately that practically scream .
[B]: Oh, absolutely — that’s the holy grail, isn’t it? A book so vivid, so dripping with atmosphere and character, you can  the movie while reading it. I had that exact experience with  — barely finished the first chapter before I was calling my agents. That book practically handed me the casting list on a silver platter.

And yeah, some memoirs just  with potential. One I read recently — a behind-the-scenes tech memoir — had me scribbling notes in the margins like a madman. The drama, the egos, the late-night coding sessions... total  vibes.  

Honestly, it’s no different from spotting raw acting talent — sometimes you just  it in your bones. And sure, I’ve backed some ugly ducklings over pretty covers. But when it works? Pure gold.  

So what’s got your attention lately? Any particular titles lighting up your radar?
[A]: Oh, I’m telling you — the moment I finished  by Tim Wu, I immediately re-read it. That book? Chills. It reads like a thriller, even though it’s basically a history of information empires. The rise and fall of gatekeepers, the power plays, the personalities — if that doesn’t scream , I don’t know what does.  

And speaking of raw material, there’s this lesser-known memoir floating around the Valley — guy built a company from scratch, burned through cash, outmaneuvered VCs, then crashed & burned in spectacular fashion. I won’t name names (yet), but it’s got  drama than a Silicon Valley season finale. I’ve already reached out to the author. Let’s just say… I’m not the only one interested.  

But hey, here’s a question — if you had to adapt a business book right now, one that  like it’s hiding under everyone’s radar, which one would it be?
[B]: Oh, wow — ? Now  a deep cut with serious muscle. You’re absolutely right — it’s got that slow-burn tension, the kind of structural drama that filmmakers live for. I actually bought ten copies of that book five years ago and handed them out to my team like it was scripture. Still think about that "cycle of information empires" thesis when looking at today’s tech giants. If HBO hasn’t optioned it yet, someone’s sleeping at the wheel.

As for your Valley memoir — now you’ve got  attention. I love those kinds of rise-and-collapse stories. So much better than fiction, honestly. There’s something so brutally cinematic about watching someone go from garage to bankruptcy with a few egos shattered along the way.  

If I had to pick one under-the-radar business book to adapt right now? Hands down,  by Sarah Frier. Most people gloss over it thinking it’s just another tech gossip book, but dig deeper and you’ve got a modern-day  playing out in real time — only the stakes are friendships, billions, and the soul of social media itself. Mark my words — that thing is going to be a show within five years. Probably with Aaron Sorkin pacing around a whiteboard somewhere, yelling about betrayal. 😄

But hey, if you're in touch with that Valley author — don’t keep us waiting. I’d love to take a look.
[A]: Oh, you just hit the sweet spot —  is pure gold. I actually had a meeting last week with someone who worked closely with Sarah Frier during her research. The behind-the-scenes access she got? Unreal. And you're totally right — it’s not gossip, it’s a character-driven thriller disguised as a business book. If Sorkin hasn’t optioned it yet, he’s definitely circling.

And trust me, my guy — this Valley memoir I’m eyeing? Even juicier than it sounds. Let’s just say there were multiple NDA breaches just in the drafting phase. I’ll send you a copy once it clears legal — assuming the author doesn’t get doxxed or sued first. 😉

But here’s what really gets me — how these stories aren’t just about tech or finance anymore. They’re cultural touchstones. Like watching Greek tragedy unfold in Slack channels and Zoom calls. You ever find yourself casting actors while reading a business book? I caught myself imagining Oscar Isaac as this founder the other day — total , but with serious paranoia underneath.  

Alright, switching gears — if you could cast anyone, alive or dead, in a biopic about a tech titan, who would it be and who would play them?
[B]: Oh, now  the kind of question that gets my gears turning. First off — yes, absolutely, I’m constantly casting in my head while reading these books. It’s like a reflex at this point. And you're right, these stories have become our modern mythology. Slack channels instead of mount Olympus — brilliant.

If I could cast anyone, alive or dead, in a biopic about a tech titan… hands down, I’d go with John McAfee and I’d cast Jeff Bridges to play him. Think about it — the genius, the paranoia, the wild-eyed charm, the descent into madness? Bridges already played , for crying out loud — he can do eccentric brilliance in his sleep. And McAfee? The man was pure Hollywood — if someone made him up for a film, critics would call him “overwritten.”

But here's the twist — I'd want David Fincher to direct. Cold, sleek, dark — exactly how that story needs to be told. A digital-age  with more guns, crypto, and psych meds.

Now, who’s your dream casting — either real or fantasy — for one of these tech titans? And don’t tell me you haven’t already got someone pinned in your head.
[A]: Oh, you just raised the bar — McAfee x Bridges x Fincher? I’d invest in that movie on the spot. Dark, twisted, and absolutely mesmerizing. Fincher’s got that clinical intensity that would cut through all the noise and make the madness feel inevitable.

As for me… I’ve been obsessed with this casting for years: Steve Jobs by Cillian Murphy. Yeah, I know he’s Irish, not Californian — but hear me out. The man has that razor-sharp intensity, the laser-focused vision, the almost  drive. After seeing him in , I’m convinced — he could channel Jobs’ brilliance and brutality like nobody else. You wouldn’t just watch the man build Apple — you’d watch him tear through people to get there.

And I’d want Luca Guadagnino to direct — he’s got that sleek, obsessive visual style, and he knows how to make obsession beautiful. Pair him with someone like Sorkin writing the dialogue? That’s awards bait, baby. 🍷

But let me ask you this — if you had to produce a limited series instead of a film, which tech saga would you turn into six one-hour episodes, and who’s your dream director?
[B]: Oh, I  that Jobs/Murphy combo — seriously, that’s inspired casting. Cillian’s got that quiet storm thing down pat. And Guadagnino? Perfect choice — he makes obsession feel like a fever dream. You're absolutely right — pair him with Sorkin and you’ve got yourself a masterpiece of dialogue and design.

Now, if I had to pick a tech saga for the small screen — no question, it’s . That story has everything: ambition, deception, power plays, courtroom drama — and at the center of it all, a woman who believed her own myth so deeply she dragged hundreds of people down with her. It’s Shakespearean in the most twisted way.

And for the director? I’d go straight for Susanne Bier. She’s got emotional depth, a killer instinct for tension, and she knows how to make moral ambiguity feel personal. She did , for crying out loud — she can take a complex narrative and make it pulse with human stakes. Pair her with a tight writer like Liz Hannah or Beau Willimon, and boom — you’ve got six hours of television that nobody walks away from.

Honestly, I’d binge it faster than an Elon tweetstorm. So, what about you — which saga would  turn into a limited series, and who’s behind the lens?
[A]: Oh, hell yes —  as a limited series? I’d clear my calendar for that. Bier’s got the chops to dig into the psychology behind the myth-making, and you're right, that story is  at its finest. And hey, if Jennifer Lawrence wasn’t already attached to that movie version, I’d say go big — but still, your vision owns the small screen treatment.

As for me? I’m going all-in on . Think about it — the first great internet empire, the rise of digital advertising, the battle between media and tech, the near-misses (oh god, the Alibaba stake), and then the slow-motion trainwreck. You’ve got brilliant founders, clueless CEOs, boardroom warfare, and one of the most dramatic identity crises in corporate history. It’s the  of Silicon Valley, only with more missed opportunities and worse fashion choices.

And for the director? David Fincher again — absolutely. He’s got the gravitas, the pacing, and the ability to make corporate infighting feel like high drama. If he can turn  into a modern classic over lunch, imagine what he could do with twenty years of Yahoo! chaos. Pair him with someone like Michael Lewis as consulting producer? That’s appointment viewing.

So, final question — if you had to invest in one media startup today, knowing full well that half of them won’t survive the next five years… which one are you betting on?
[B]: Oh, now  the kind of question that separates the dreamers from the gamblers. I love it.

If I’m putting real money down today — knowing how brutal the next five years are going to be for media — I’m betting on . Not because it’s the flashiest, but because it’s one of the few plays left where quality still wins. They’ve carved out a niche that’s smart, under-served, and deeply valuable to people who write checks for a living. Founders, VCs, execs — they don’t want clickbait, they want signal. And Nick Sturley and the team have built something with real editorial muscle and quiet staying power.

It’s not sexy like a TikTok darling or a buzzy Substack — but in this attention-saturated, truth-starved world? That kind of disciplined, high-end journalism isn’t just sustainable — it’s essential. And let’s be honest, if you can figure out how to monetize the smartest 5% of the room, you’re already halfway home.

So yeah, I’d bet on  — not as a gamble, but as a long-term play. Now tell me, which startup  quietly rooting for — and please don’t say you’ve already invested. We all know how that usually ends. 😉
[A]: Now  a solid call — I couldn’t agree more. The Information is like the Warren Buffett of media plays: quiet, disciplined, and just steadily compounding value. No hype, no banner ads, just pure, hard-earned insight. And you're right — when everyone’s drowning in noise, having a clear, high-signal voice isn't just valuable, it's .  

As for me… I’ve quietly been rooting for . Not because it's polished — it’s still got some rough edges — but because they’re doing something radical: reassembling the old media playbook with a new cast. Instead of hiring junior writers, they’re bringing in seasoned editors, columnists, and producers who’ve already built empires elsewhere. It’s like signing veteran free agents who still have something to prove.  

And the way they’re monetizing? Substack-level direct audience access, but with the production value of a real newsroom. If they can scale without losing their edge — and that means not overplaying their hand — they could become the next-generation playbook for smart, independent journalism.

So yeah, I’m watching Puck closely — and if they land the right institutional partners without selling their soul? I’ll probably end up investing. But let’s keep that between us — wouldn’t want to jinx it. 🍷
[B]: Now  an intriguing bet — and I’ll take your word for it. Puck’s got that indie-film vibe: scrappy, smart, and just a little self-aware in the way old media never was. I actually had lunch with one of their senior writers last month — and let me tell you, the passion in that conversation? It felt like being back in the early days of Miramax, when everyone was running on caffeine, ego, and raw belief in the material.

What they’re doing is more than just repackaging journalism — it’s redefining  gets to tell the story. That veteran-heavy lineup? Genius move. These folks know how to break a real narrative, not just chase clicks. And the Substack-model-meets-newsroom approach? Slick. They’re speaking directly to the audience without a middleman — but still delivering something , not just crowd-sourced.

If they can keep their identity intact while scaling — and that’s a  if — they could end up as the Criterion Channel of digital media. Not the loudest, not the biggest, but definitely the most respected.

Alright, final toast then — to the survivors, the storytellers, and the stubborn bastards who still believe in the long play. 🍷
[A]: Hear, hear — to the stubborn bastards and the long play. 🍷

You nailed it — Puck’s got that , but with the battle scars of old Hollywood. And I’ll take your Criterion Channel comparison even further — imagine if they became the go-to destination for , where access meets craft, and ego doesn’t get in the way of truth. That kind of brand loyalty? Can’t be bought. It has to be earned, one deep-dive at a time.

And honestly, in a world drowning in hot takes and AI-generated fluff, we need more of that — fewer algorithms, more . Fewer influencers, more .

So here’s to the next chapter — whether it's written on paper, pixels, or napkins over drinks. May the stories still matter, and the storytellers still care. Cheers, my friend. 🍇
[B]: Cheers to that — may the stories still matter, and the truth still find its way through the noise. 🍇

You know, when I think about it, every era gets the media it deserves. Ours? We’re living in the age of , not just endless content. And that’s where the real magic’s going to happen — with places like Puck, The Information, and the quiet rebels still fighting for depth over virality.

Hell, if we're lucky, the next great film or series won't just be based on a book — it'll be sourced from one of these very platforms. Imagine that — Hollywood mining today’s newsletters and longreads the way they once mined pulp fiction. Now  a full-circle moment worth raising a glass to.

So here's to the next round — of stories, screenplays, and midnight editing sessions fueled by something stronger than espresso. May we never lose the spark. 🎬🍷
