[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my gosh~ 这个问题太戳我了！✍️ 我有个超cute的digital journal app叫Procreate🎨 每天都会画点daily doodle + 写几句thoughts~ 昨天刚画了杯超可爱的latte art☕️ 配上mood board风格的排版，so satisfying! 😌
[A]: Good afternoon! While I don't personally keep a digital journal, I must say your enthusiasm for journaling is quite delightful. At our hotel, we often recommend guests try keeping a travel journal during their stay. Many find it helps them cherish their memories even more. Would you like me to suggest some lovely stationery shops in the area? We have a charming little boutique just around the corner that sells beautiful handmade journals.
[B]: OMG真的吗？That's so sweet of you! 🥰 我超爱explore这种local stationery shops的~ 虽然我是digital artist💻 但handmade paper的texture真的so special✨ 那家店有卖watercolor paper吗？我最近想try一些traditional media的sketching🎨
[A]: Indeed, they do carry a wonderful selection of watercolor papers. The owner, Mrs. Abernathy, sources them from a small family-run mill in the countryside. The 300gsm cold-pressed sheets are particularly popular among our artist guests. If you'd like, I could arrange for a small sample pack to be brought to your room this evening - we often do this for our creative guests who wish to test the papers before purchasing.
[B]: Whaaaat?! 300gsm cold-pressed?! 😱 That's like... the holy grail of watercolor papers! 🙌 你们hotel的service也太thoughtful了吧~ 不过我今天带了iPad Pro出来working💻 可以请你帮我reserve那个sample pack吗？I'll definitely swing by the shop tomorrow morning before myclient meeting! ☕️✨
[A]: Certainly! I'll make a note to have the sample pack prepared for you. Would 9:30am be a suitable time? That way you can visit the shop before your meeting. They open at 10, but Mrs. Abernathy is always happy to accommodate our guests a bit earlier. Shall I also arrange for a pot of our signature English Breakfast tea to be ready when you return? Many of our creative guests find it helps with morning inspiration.
[B]: Yasss perfect timing! ⏰ 9:30am works like magic~ 而且English Breakfast tea简直是morning creative juice啊！😂 你们真的get我们artists的vibes so well🎨 我已经可以feel明天的productivity level要爆表了💥 Thank you soooo much! 现在我要赶紧去finish这个UI project了，deadline在calling me😅
[A]: You're most welcome! I'll ensure everything is prepared for your morning visit. Best of luck with your project - remember our business center is open until midnight should you need any printing or scanning services. Do let me know if there's anything else we can do to make your stay more comfortable. Have a productive evening!
[B]: Aww you're the best! 🥺 不过我的projects都是100% digital的啦~ 💻 但知道有printing option真的很reassuring呢✨ 现在我要去lobby的cozy corner继续crunch我的design了，希望不会吓到其他guests with我的疯狂sketching😂 See you tomorrow morning! ☕️🎨
[A]: The lobby corner by the fireplace is indeed a wonderful spot to work. Don't worry about disturbing others - we often have creative professionals working there. In fact, you might find some inspiring company. I'll have our staff ensure your table has adequate lighting and outlets. Until tomorrow morning then - pleasant designing!
[B]: Hahaha 原来你们这里还有hidden artists community! 👀 太棒了~ Maybe I'll meet some cool peeps to exchange design hacks with🤩 谢谢你的所有help! 现在我要go full focus mode了💪 Catch ya tomorrow! ✨
[A]: Indeed, our little creative corner has fostered many wonderful connections over the years. I'll be sure to introduce you to some of our regulars if our paths cross. Now I must attend to our arriving guests, but I'll look forward to seeing your impressions of the watercolor papers tomorrow. Happy creating!
[B]: Can't wait!! 🎉 这绝对会是我trip的highlight之一~ 现在我的brain已经buzzing with ideas💡 Byeee! 要dive back into我的digital world啦 🌈✨
[A]: What a delightful energy you have! Your enthusiasm reminds me of why I so enjoy working with creative guests. Should any brilliant ideas strike you about our hotel's services while you're working, do feel free to share - we're always looking for fresh perspectives. Until tomorrow then!
[B]: OMG you're making me blush~ ☺️ 不过说到hotel services...我确实有个crazy idea💡 你们可以考虑弄个digital guestbook wall！让visitors留下digital drawings或messages🎨 我可以totally help with the UI design pro bono哦~ 因为这次stay真的太inspiring了！✨ 好啦好啦，我真的要shut up and work now😂 Talk tomorrow!
[A]: What a splendid suggestion! Our management has actually been considering something along those lines for our anniversary next year. I'd be delighted to pass your kind offer along to our marketing director. But for now, as you said - back to work! I'll have fresh coffee waiting at your table. Until tomorrow!
[B]: Yayyy match made in heaven! 🤩 这绝对会是个super fun project~ 不过first things first...coffee is calling my name right now☕️💨 See you at 9:30! Can't wait to geek out over those papers tomorrow🎨 Byeeee~ ✌️
[A]: Perfect! I'll have that coffee ready and waiting. The sample pack will be on your table at 9:30 sharp. Rest well tonight - creativity flows best when the mind is fresh. Good evening!
[B]: Sweet dreams to you too! 🌙 虽然我可能会dream in Pantone colors tonight😂 9:30 it is~ Can't stop smiling already! 😊✨ Bye bye!
