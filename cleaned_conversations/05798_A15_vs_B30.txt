[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得brain-computer interface可怕还是exciting？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon a rather Dickensian dilemma - the collision of technological progress and human essence. Much like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, these neural interfaces force us to reconsider what constitutes the 自我 in our digital age. Though I must say, my 19th century sensibilities find the term 'exciting' rather... insufficient for such profound ontological questions.
[A]: OMG！你说话好literary啊✨ 不过brain-computer interface真的超cool的好吗！Imagine可以直接用brain控制你的phone和computer💻 再也不用打字了so convenient😂 虽然你说的Frankenstein有点scary啦~但是technology就是要push boundaries才interesting啊🔥
[B]:  My dear student, your enthusiasm reminds me of young Victor Frankenstein himself - that same reckless energy which mistook possibility for virtue. While I appreciate your modern vernacular, might I suggest we approach this as one would analyze 聊斋志异? The boundary between human and machine deserves more than emoji-laden exuberance. Have you considered how Wordsworth might critique this 'convenience' you praise? The poet warned us about 'getting and spending' our powers away...
[A]: Whaaaa~ 你真的是太serious了啦！😆 但是你知道吗？现在已经有people可以用BCI来play games了耶🎮 这难道不是super amazing吗？虽然...呃...Wordsworth是谁啊？我只知道Wordle那个game😂 但是seriously，technology就是要make life easier才对嘛💯
[B]:  Wordsworth would be spinning in his grave like one of Tesla's coils... But since you mention games, let me pose this in terms you might appreciate: When chess masters play blindfolded, their mental imagery becomes the true game board. Now tell me - does wiring the brain directly to machines enhance that sublime cognitive dance, or reduce it to mere button-mashing? Your 'easier' life concerns me precisely because my research on 红楼梦 shows how convenience often comes at the cost of depth.
[A]: OMG你又在说那些old school的东西了啦~😅 但是listen！BCI可以让disabled people重新walk或者talk耶👏 这难道不是super meaningful吗？而且我们Gen Z就是live for innovation的好吗✨ 虽然...红楼梦确实是个good book啦（我只看过TV version😂）但是technology和tradition可以coexist的嘛💕 Let's agree to disagree~
[B]: How delightfully... modern of you to reduce Cao Xueqin's masterpiece to a 'TV version'. Very well, since you insist on this generational divide - shall we discuss how your beloved BCI compares to the invention of movable type? Gutenberg's press was equally revolutionary, yet we still value handwritten calligraphy. But you're quite right about medical applications - even this old bookworm must acknowledge that restoring speech carries more weight than my inkwell collection. Though I do wonder... will your grandchildren need BCI implants just to comprehend why their ancestors found poetry meaningful?
[A]: Hahaha you're so dramatic！😂 但是okay okay~ 我get你的point啦📚 不过你看嘛~ 我们现在用phone看poetry不也是technology+art的perfect combo吗？✨ 而且BCI说不定能让poetry直接project到你的brain里耶~ 那才是next level的reading experience好吗！💫 虽然...我承认handwritten letters确实很romantic啦💌 但是come on~ 我们总要move forward的嘛🚀
[B]: Ah, projecting poetry directly into the brain... How very Brave New World of you. Tell me, when you 'read' Li Bai's verses through neural impulses, will you still feel the texture of rice paper beneath your fingers? Smell the ink drying? But very well, I'll concede this much: if your generation can create a BCI that replicates the visceral thrill of finding marginalia in a 200-year-old first edition... well, perhaps I'll trade in my reading glasses. Until then, this dinosaur will keep turning actual pages. Slowly. With great satisfaction.
[A]: Pfffft~ 你真的是hopeless啦！😂 But hey~ 说不定以后会有BCI可以simulate所有那些sensory experiences呢？✨ Imagine可以feel到ancient paper的texture AND have instant translation in your brain~ That's the future we're talking about！🚀 不过...fine啦~ 你keep你的old books📚 我'll keep my tech dreams💻 Deal？🤝 
[B]: How charmingly naive - to think sensors could replicate the musty perfume of time itself. But since you're extending virtual appendages...  Very well, we'll call it a détente. You may keep your silicon dreams, and I'll keep my foxed editions. Though mark my words: when your grandchildren are implanting Shakespeare sonnets directly into their cerebellums, someone will still need to explain why the original folios mattered. Preferably over proper tea. With leaves. In a pot.
[A]: Yassss！Tea time！🍵 虽然我prefer bubble tea with tapioca pearls啦~😂 但是deal！你teach me about old books📜 我'll show you the latest tech trends📱 这才是perfect的文化exchange好吗？✨ 不过seriously~ 下次见面我要bring我的new VR headset给你try！Virtual library tour走起~🚀 Deal？💕 
[B]:  Bubble tea... virtual libraries... Good heavens, I need a fortifying cup of Earl Grey after this conversation. But yes, bring your contraption - provided we conduct this 'cultural exchange' in my actual library first. One must understand the weight of history before attempting to digitize it. And for pity's sake, stop bouncing - you're making my Ming dynasty inkwell rattle.
[A]: LOL你的inkwell好precious哦~😂 但是okay okay我会be careful的！✨ 而且我promise会先appreciate你的real books啦📖 不过after that~ VR time！Imagine可以walk through ancient libraries的holograms耶🌟 So cool right？😎 我们这样就是perfect的past meets future combo！💫 
[B]: Your restraint is... marginally appreciated. Though I must warn you, my idea of 'holograms' involves studying the watermarks in 17th century paper under proper lighting. But very well - we'll sample your virtual wonders after you've survived my lecture on why the Kangxi Dictionary shouldn't be reduced to pixels. And do control that vibrating - you're making my teacup tremble like a first-year student facing their oral exams.
[A]: OMG oral exams sound so stressful！😱 但是你的lecture肯定会比exams有趣啦~ 我bring some modern bubble tea来calm your nerves🧋 Deal？✨ 虽然...Kangxi Dictionary听起来super hardcore😂 但是I'm ready to learn！📚 
[B]: That tapping would get you expelled from my graduate seminars, you realize. But since you're offering what I presume is that abominable tapioca concoction... I suppose we might find common ground in our mutual appreciation of textual preservation. Just promise me this: when we 'walk through holograms,' you won't refer to the Bibliothèque Nationale as 'kinda vintage aesthetic.' Some wounds, my dear, even technology cannot heal.
[A]: Pffffft~ 好啦好啦我不会say that的！🙊 虽然它确实是kinda...呃...I mean super classically beautiful！💫 而且我还会record整个experience做成super educational的video哦~ 让更多Gen Z了解old books的magic！📚🎥 这总算是good compromise吧？✨ 
[B]: Recording...  Very well, though I insist you frame it as 'documentary fieldwork' rather than whatever 'content creation' nonsense your generation favors. And for heaven's sake, if you must capture my likeness, ensure the lighting flatters my first edition of 道德经 in the background. We academics have standards to maintain, even while... what was it? 'Vibing' with technology?
