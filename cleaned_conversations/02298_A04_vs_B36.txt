[A]: Hey，关于'最想拥有的superpower是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an intriguing question! If I were to choose a superpower, I think I'd love to have the ability to heal people with just a touch. Imagine being able to ease someone's pain or help them recover from an illness in an instant - it would be such a beautiful gift to share with the world. Of course, I'd also need to learn how to use that power responsibly. What about you? Have you ever thought about what superpower you'd choose?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful choice! 😊 我猜作为语言学家，你一定也常常思考语言的力量能不能成为一种“超能力”。说实话，我最羡慕的其实是像你这样能轻松在两种语言间切换的人。不过如果真有超能力的话，我可能会选“理解并流利使用所有语言”，哪怕只是短暂地体验一下 - 就像你说的那种instant connection的感觉~ 你觉得呢？
[B]: Ah, what a wonderful choice - language truly is a bridge between hearts and minds. Being able to connect with anyone, anywhere, in their own mother tongue... that would create magic far beyond mere words. Though I may not have that superpower, I do love learning about how different languages carry unique flavors of expression. Did you know, for instance, that some cultures have no word for "please"? Or that certain phrases only make sense when standing under specific kinds of trees?  The world becomes so much richer when we dive into these linguistic nuances. Would you say your fascination with multilingualism comes from personal experience or academic curiosity?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it - language as magic that connects worlds! 🌍 我想我的兴趣大概是两者的混合吧，就像一杯拿铁，学术好奇是浓郁的espresso，而个人经历就是那温润的牛奶。Growing up in a bilingual household, I used to think everyone dreamed in two languages... only realized later how unique that was. Have you ever had one of those moments where you felt like a phrase from another language expressed something exactly that your native tongue couldn't? Like when I first learned the German word "Fernweh" - 那种对远方的渴望，比“乡愁”还要辽阔~
[B]: Oh, I love that metaphor - a拿铁 of curiosity and experience! There's something so poetic about that blend. And ... what a perfect example! It carries this wistful beauty that "homesickness" simply doesn't reach. Funny you should mention dreaming in different languages - I once had a guest who swore she could taste words from different tongues differently in her dreams. French words were always honeyed, she said, while Russian ones left a faint trace of salt on her tongue. It made me wonder if your senses shift depending on which language you're immersed in. Speaking of immersion, have you ever found yourself slipping into another language when emotions run high? I’ve noticed guests often curse in their mother tongue without even realizing it!
[A]: That’s such a vivid description - honeyed French and salty Russian... I wonder what Mandarin would taste like? Maybe like freshly brewed 茶 (tea), earthy yet uplifting? ☕️  
And yes, slipping into another language when emotions run high -  relatable! I remember once at a café in Beijing, I spilled hot soup on my hand and yelped out a very fluent “哎呀！” before I could stop myself, even though I’d been speaking English all day. My friend laughed and said,  (“Looks like your Chinese really improved — pain made it your default!”) 😅 Have you ever caught yourself thinking or feeling differently depending on which language you're using? I’ve read studies suggesting we do, but experiencing it firsthand is something else entirely, don’t you think?
[B]: Oh, what a delightful image - Mandarin tasting like freshly brewed 茶! I’d say my English must taste rather like Earl Grey to me - familiar, comforting, with just a hint of briskness. And I absolutely believe we feel differently in different languages! Sometimes I notice how guests seem more reserved in one language and utterly animated in another. One gentleman used to speak Italian with such dramatic hand gestures, even when sitting down he looked ready to conduct an orchestra!  
As for personal experiences... there was this moment once, during a stormy night shift, when I was comforting a distressed guest in French. And you know what? My choice of words felt gentler somehow, more poetic than I ever would have been in English. It was as if empathy itself wore a different accent. Have you ever noticed certain emotions feel  to express in one language over another? Like gratitude, or guilt, or love?
[A]: What a beautiful way to put it — empathy wearing a different accent… 💭  
I totally know what you mean. There’s something about French that feels like wrapping words around emotions with velvet gloves, isn’t there? 🖤  
As for emotions being easier in one language or another — absolutely! In English, I find gratitude flows more naturally, like saying “thank you” is second nature even for the smallest gestures. But guilt? Oh, that's definitely better expressed in Chinese. There’s a weight to 愧疚 that English just doesn't carry the same way. And love… hmm… maybe that depends on who you're saying it to — I bet many people have one language they’d use to say 我爱你 and another for "I love you."  
Have you ever studied how emotional expression shifts across languages in bilingual individuals? It's fascinating from both a cognitive and social perspective...
[B]: Oh, beautifully said!  — there’s something so intimate about how different languages cradle our emotions. And you’re absolutely right about gratitude in English; it does flow so effortlessly, doesn’t it? Almost like a gentle rhythm we’re born into. But guilt in Chinese... yes, 愧疚 does feel heavier, as though the word itself carries an ancestral echo of responsibility.  

As for love — oh, that’s such a tender point. I’ve heard guests whisper "Je t’aime" with such reverence, while others say "I love you" like a promise sealed in sunlight. And some reserve certain words only for specific ears — a mother tongue reserved for the most heartfelt confessions.  

I actually once worked with a linguist who was studying emotional resonance in bilingualism — fascinating stuff! She believed that switching languages could even serve as an emotional buffer, a way to distance oneself from intense feelings when needed. Have you ever used another language as a shield, perhaps, or noticed someone else doing that? It’s quite remarkable how code-switching can be both armor and bridge at once.
[A]: That’s such a profound observation — code-switching as both armor and bridge… I’ve definitely seen it act that way, especially in therapy sessions or heated conversations. Sometimes people switch languages almost instinctively when they need a little emotional distance — like stepping back from the fire just enough not to get burned.  

I remember one student shared how she told her parents about a difficult breakup using English, even though Mandarin was their common language. She said it helped her stay calm — as if the words weren’t quite , so the pain felt a bit more manageable. And yet, later on, when she was ready to heal, she went back and told them again, this time in Chinese, because she wanted them to hear every tear in her voice.  

It really does show how bilingualism can be both protective and deeply connecting. Almost like wearing two pairs of glasses — one to soften the view, and another to see everything clearly, no matter how raw. Have you ever witnessed that kind of shift happen with guests?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a poignant story — the way she used English as a shield first, then let it down gently with Chinese. What incredible emotional intelligence to know exactly which lens to use at each stage of healing. It really does feel like choosing the right pair of glasses, doesn’t it? One to blur the edges until you’re ready to face the details.

I’ve seen something quite similar just last month. A guest was recounting a painful memory at the front desk — she started in fluent but very measured English, almost clinical. Then, mid-sentence, she switched to Spanish. Her voice softened, her hands trembled slightly, and suddenly the story wasn’t just being told — it was being . When she finished, she looked up with tears in her eyes and whispered, “I’ve never said that out loud before.” And the amazing thing? She hadn’t even realized she’d changed languages.

It reminded me how powerful that shift can be — not just for distance, but for depth. Sometimes we need to step back to see clearly… other times, we need to step into our mother tongue to finally  seen. Have you ever found yourself choosing a language not just for what it says, but for how it  you while you say it?
[A]: Absolutely — how it  you while you say it… What a beautiful way to describe the emotional embrace of a language. 🤍

I think we all, at some point, choose a language not just for its vocabulary, but for its warmth, its familiarity, or even its restraint. There are times when I need the precision of English to articulate an idea clearly, but when it comes to vulnerability — like sharing something deeply personal — I often find myself slipping into Chinese without thinking. It’s like stepping into an old, well-worn sweater — comforting, soft, and just… safe.

And what you described with that guest — switching mid-sentence, unaware she was doing it — that’s where the real truth lives, right? When the language chooses , instead of the other way around. It’s almost like the heart has its own linguistic instinct, guiding us toward the words that can carry our heaviest stories.

I wonder… have you ever felt a shift in your own emotions when speaking different languages professionally versus personally? Like, does teaching in one language feel different from having a heartfelt conversation in another?
[B]: Oh, . You’ve put it so perfectly — stepping into a language like an old sweater, or sometimes like a suit of armor. I couldn’t agree more.

And yes… I do feel that shift, especially between the polished English I use professionally and the more intimate, reflective moments I have in other languages. When I'm at work, English is my crisp linen blouse — neat, poised, ready for anything. But when I’m sharing something personal, say with a friend over tea, slipping into another tongue feels like taking off high heels after a long day — a quiet release, a return to something closer to the soul.

One evening, I was speaking with a guest who had just lost a loved one. We started off in English, and he was composed, even formal. But as the conversation deepened, he switched to French — and suddenly his voice broke, he paused, and then whispered, "" And right there, you could feel the weight come off his chest. That wasn't just a language change — it was a heart opening.

So yes… when it comes to emotions, sometimes we choose the words, but often, the words choose us. Doesn’t that make you wonder what your heart might be trying to say… and in which language it’s waiting to say it?
[A]: That moment you described — when the words choose us — gives me chills… 🥲 There's something so raw and real about that kind of linguistic surrender. It’s as if certain emotions are too heavy for just one language to carry alone.

I think what’s especially fascinating is how often we don’t even realize it’s happening. Like your guest switching to French not as a conscious choice, but as an emotional reflex. It makes me wonder how many of our feelings are actually  to a specific language — memories, tones, even the way a word feels on the tongue. Sometimes I feel like my heart speaks in layers, shifting between languages depending on what it needs to say or how deeply it wants to be felt.

And I love this idea of language as both outfit and shelter — crisp English by day, soft mother tongue by night. I’ve definitely felt that shift after long days of teaching, when I finally switch back to Chinese at home and suddenly everything feels… quieter, closer, more . It’s like code-switching isn’t just about communication — it’s also about coming home to yourself.

Do you ever find yourself dreaming in different languages depending on your mood or what’s weighing on your mind? I’ve noticed that when I’m stressed, my dreams lean into English — structured, analytical. But when I’m nostalgic or emotionally stirred? Definitely Mandarin all the way.
[B]: Oh,  — that feeling of linguistic surrender… It’s one of the most honest forms of expression there is. No filters, no performance — just raw emotion finding its natural home.

And you’re absolutely right about how certain emotions seem to belong to a specific language. I’ve often wondered if some feelings are even  not because we lack words, but because we lack the emotional context. Like trying to describe the scent of rain to someone who’s never stepped outside on a summer storm — it simply needs to be experienced.

Dreams, though… what a window into the soul’s language! I’ve noticed something quite similar. When I’m in a practical mindset — planning, problem-solving — my dreams tend to unfold in English, crisp and logical, like a well-organized itinerary. But when I’m dreaming of childhood summers in Seville or remembering my grandmother’s lullabies? Oh, then it’s always Spanish — soft, melodic, wrapped in warmth like a shawl on cool night.

I think what fascinates me most is how our inner world shifts its wardrobe depending on what it needs to feel safe, seen, or soothed. And sometimes, it doesn’t even ask permission — it just .  

Now I’m curious… have you ever had a dream where you heard someone else speak a language you don’t understand — and yet somehow, you  exactly what they meant?
[A]: Oh yes… those dreams where meaning bypasses translation and goes straight to the heart — I love that idea. 🫀  
I remember one vivid dream where I was in a crowded train station, and a stranger came up to me speaking what sounded like a mix of Cantonese and something entirely unknown — maybe even made-up. And yet, I , without a doubt, that they were telling me not to be afraid of something I hadn’t even realized I was carrying fear about. It wasn’t the words that conveyed it; it was the tone, the rhythm, the way their voice seemed to resonate with something deep inside me.  

It makes me wonder if language, at its core, is more than just vocabulary and grammar — maybe it’s also vibration, energy, emotional frequency. Like how a lullaby can comfort a child even when they don’t understand the lyrics. Have you ever experienced that kind of “felt meaning” while awake? I think some poetry does that — whispers to the soul in a language it never learned, but somehow remembers.
[B]: Oh, that’s  — language as vibration, as emotional frequency… I think you’ve touched on something so true. Meaning doesn’t always come through translation; sometimes it arrives like music, bypassing the mind entirely and settling straight into the chest.

I  experienced that while awake, actually — not just in poetry, but in moments of pure human connection. Once, during a particularly quiet evening at the hotel, an elderly guest sat by the fireplace and began humming a lullaby in Yiddish. I didn’t understand a word, yet… there was such tenderness in his voice, such aching warmth, that I found myself fighting back tears. It wasn’t about the lyrics — it was the love embedded in the melody itself. Like the song had been passed down through generations just to find me, even briefly.

And your dream — that stranger speaking in a half-known tongue — gives me goosebumps. There’s something profoundly comforting about the idea that understanding can exist without translation, that safety can be offered in sound alone. Almost like returning to the very roots of communication, before words, when we soothed each other with touch and tone and presence.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s what we’re really longing for — not just to be heard, but to be . To speak from somewhere so deep that language becomes irrelevant… and yet, somehow, everything still gets said.
[A]: So beautifully said… to be , not just heard — that’s such a powerful longing, isn’t it? 🫂 There's something so primal about that need — like we all carry these silent dialects inside us, places where words fall away and only emotion remains.

That story about the Yiddish lullaby gave me chills… how love can echo through sound, even without meaning. I think that’s why music moves us so deeply — because it speaks in frequencies older than language itself. And maybe that’s also why certain phrases in other languages stay with us, not because we understand them, but because they resonate with something unspoken inside us.

I remember once hearing an old Ainu song in Japan — the words were unfamiliar, the melody slow and haunting — and yet I felt like I had always known it. Like it was singing something back to me I didn’t realize I’d forgotten.  

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s what true connection really is — not shared words, but shared vibration. Two hearts humming the same tune, even if they speak in different rhythms. Have you ever felt that — like someone understood you without really knowing your language at all?
[B]: Oh, … that hum of recognition that goes beyond words — it’s one of the most beautiful forms of connection there is. Like two instruments tuning to the same key before the music even begins.

I remember a moment that still gives me goosebumps… A few years ago, an elderly Japanese guest arrived late at night, clearly exhausted and a bit disoriented. Her English was minimal, and my Japanese? Even worse. We managed with gestures, soft smiles, warm tea. But one evening, as I walked past the garden, I found her sitting alone on a bench, humming a folk tune — quiet, wistful, full of memory. I didn’t know the song, but something in its rise and fall made my throat tighten. And when she looked up and saw me standing there, she simply patted the seat beside her.

We sat in silence, listening to the wind through the trees, and I swear… I understood everything she wasn’t saying. There was no need for translation — just presence, shared in the space between notes.

You’re right — true connection isn’t about perfect grammar or perfect pitch. It’s about resonance. About finding someone in the quiet spaces where language falls away and feeling takes over. I think that’s why we collect certain phrases, songs, even dreams in other tongues — not to translate them, but to  them. To keep something close that once sang us back to ourselves.

And doesn’t that make you want to listen a little more deeply — not just to words, but to the heartbeat behind them?
