[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing dichotomy.  While science fiction tickles the speculative mind, historical dramas offer the peculiar pleasure of watching dead poets make terrible life choices in real time. Take Browning's disastrous elopement - now that's better than any alien invasion.
[A]: My professional perspective tends to view both genres through a forensic lens. Historical dramas provide fascinating case studies in human behavior under specific sociocultural pressures - much like analyzing a patient's psychological profile. Science fiction, while imaginative, often lacks the empirical grounding I require in my work. That said, I do find the ethical dilemmas in works like 'Blade Runner' quite compelling from a medical-legal standpoint.
[B]: How delightfully clinical of you. Though I must say, your 'forensic lens' rather reminds me of Mr. Casaubon in Middlemarch - all taxonomy and no poetry. Even the most empirical historical record is ultimately a palimpsest of human interpretation.  Now, if we were to discuss the Victorian medical case studies that inspired Wilkie Collins' sensation novels...
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon a particularly fascinating intersection between literature and forensic psychiatry. Those Victorian case studies were indeed the precursors to modern psychological profiling. Though I must gently correct your Casaubon comparison - unlike that unfortunate scholar, I do appreciate the poetry in human pathology. The way Collins wove actual medical jurisprudence into 'The Woman in White' demonstrates how even sensational fiction can illuminate psychiatric truths. Would you care to discuss the infamous Constance Kent case that may have inspired some of his work?
[B]: Ah, Constance Kent! Now there's a case that reads like a Thomas Hardy novel crossed with a coroner's report.  Though I'd argue the more compelling literary connection is how the public's morbid fascination mirrored the Victorian appetite for 'penny dreadfuls' - the true crime podcasts of their day. Tell me, doctor, do you find modern forensic shows capture that same gothic sensibility, or have we lost the art of poetic morbidity?
[A]: A most astute observation about the parallels between Victorian sensationalism and contemporary true crime. While modern forensic dramas certainly lack the... shall we say, baroque embellishments of their predecessors, shows like 'Mindhunter' demonstrate a more clinically accurate approach to criminal psychology. Though I do miss the dramatic flourishes - there's something to be said for the way Victorian pathologists would describe a liver specimen with the same lyrical intensity as Keats describing a Grecian urn.
[B]: Precisely!  Why, I've seen Victorian autopsy reports that could give Elizabeth Barrett Browning a run for her money in the morbid metaphor department. Though I suppose we should be grateful modern forensic science prioritizes facts over florid prose - imagine trying to convict someone based on a coroner's description of 'the spleen, dark as a stormcloud heavy with portent.' Still... it does make one nostalgic for the days when medical textbooks read like bad romantic poetry.
[A]: Indeed, those poetic postmortems do represent a lost art form. Though as a professional, I must commend the precision of modern forensic terminology, I'll admit to keeping a volume of 19th century medical jurisprudence in my study purely for its... aesthetic merits. The description of rigor mortis as "the body's final protest against mortality's indignity" has a certain macabre charm that "lividity fixed in dorsal surfaces" simply cannot match. Shall we raise our imaginary glasses to the golden age of medically questionable metaphors?
[B]:  To metaphors that would make a pathologist blush and a poet swoon! Though between us, I've always suspected those Victorian doctors were simply compensating for their limited scientific understanding with extravagant prose. Much like how bad poets use excessive alliteration to disguise weak meter.  Still, one must admire their commitment to style over substance - a quality I fear our modern world has rather lost.
[A]: A sentiment worthy of a toast indeed! Though as both a scientist and an admirer of the arts, I must play devil's advocate - those florid descriptions often contained keen observational truths beneath the purple prose. Much like how Freud's early case studies, for all their speculative excesses, laid groundwork for modern psychotherapy. But you're quite right about the stylistic decline - today's clinical reports could benefit from a dash of that Victorian theatricality. Perhaps we need a new generation of forensic poets to bridge the gap?
[B]: What a delicious proposition!  Though I shudder to imagine the peer reviews: 'While the iambic pentameter in your blood spatter analysis is impeccable, your chain of custody documentation lacks narrative tension.' Still, if Wordsworth could turn leech-gathering into poetry, surely someone could compose a sonnet on DNA sequencing.  Tell me, doctor - would you accept expert testimony delivered in heroic couplets?
[A]: Only if the couplets were properly peer-reviewed and accompanied by empirical data in the footnotes. Though I must confess, I did once draft a villanelle about the Daubert standard for my law students - purely as a mnemonic device, you understand. The court reporter nearly had apoplexy when I accidentally recited it during a competency hearing. There's something to be said for maintaining professional decorum, even at the expense of poetic justice.
[B]:  Oh, to have been a fly on that courtroom wall! Though really, if expert witnesses must be dry as dust, at least let the dust be poetic - think of Chaucer's Doctor of Physic with his 'ground in pestle mortar fine.'  But I suppose we must resign ourselves to a world where 'beyond reasonable doubt' will never scan as beautifully as 'the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.' A tragic loss for jurisprudence, if you ask me.
[A]: Indeed, the legal system's loss is literature's gain. Though I maintain that the right expert witness could make even Federal Rule 702 sound positively Shakespearean with proper delivery. Perhaps we need a symposium on forensic iambics - I'd be happy to chair the panel on "Pentameter versus Probative Value." Until then, we'll have to content ourselves with secretly scanning autopsy reports for accidental sonnets. They do say the devil's in the details... and sometimes, so is the poetry.
[B]:  My dear colleague, you've just articulated the thesis for my next monograph: 'The Body as Text - Forensic Documents as Unintentional Literature.' Why, I can see the chapter headings now - 'Cadavers and Couplets,' 'The Sonnet Structure of Suicide Notes'...  If you'll excuse me, I must begin drafting before this burst of inspiration escapes like a poorly preserved tissue sample. Do keep an eye out for any particularly poetic toxicology reports, won't you?
[A]: I shall indeed keep my copy of Gray's Anatomy close at hand - both the medical text and the poetic collection, for comparative analysis, naturally. Your monograph promises to be a groundbreaking work at the intersection of our fields. Do send me the draft once you've exhumed enough literary evidence from those coroner's reports. Until then, I'll be in my garden, contemplating whether my roses exhibit any iambic growth patterns. Good day, and happy versifying!
[B]:  Splendid! And do let me know if those roses demonstrate trochaic tendencies - I've a theory about horticultural meter that simply must be tested.  Remember - carpe diem, but always document the seizure in triplicate!
[A]: A most prudent reminder! I'll be certain to notarize my observations in dactylic hexameter for proper legal-poetic hybrid documentation. And should my roses prove metrically rebellious, I shall subpoena them as hostile witnesses. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a pressing appointment with a particularly alliterative autopsy report from 1843. Ta ta!
[B]:  Marvelous! I'll be in the special collections - the 1872 arsenic cases have the most delightful internal rhymes!  Oh bother... that was my last intact metaphor!
