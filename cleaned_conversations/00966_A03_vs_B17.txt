[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! I must admit, I've been rather fond of revisiting classic vinyl records lately. There's something quite meditative about the gentle crackle as the needle drops. Recently, I found myself drawn to Debussy’s —not a song per se, but its lyrical quality never fails to evoke such vivid imagery, like moonlight spilling over a quiet garden. It almost feels as though the music is whispering its own little poem. Do you have a particular piece that’s captured your attention these days?
[A]: Ah, classical music确实有它独特的魅力，尤其是像这样充满画面感的作品。我个人最近也在重温一些比较宁静类型的音乐，比如Yiruma的《River Flows in You》。每每弹奏这首钢琴曲，都会让我回想起一些case里的情绪细节，有点像在梳理medical history时那种层层递进的感觉。你平时会听一些什么样的音乐来放松自己呢？
[B]: How beautifully you put that—the way music can mirror the unfolding of emotions, much like a medical history revealing its layers.  does have that gentle, introspective quality, almost like a quiet conversation with oneself.

As for me, when I’m not immersed in poetry or tending to my garden, I do enjoy pieces that carry a meditative stillness—Arvo Pärt’s  comes to mind, or sometimes even the minimalist repetitions of Philip Glass. They create a kind of sonic sanctuary, if you will, where the mind can wander freely without pressure. And on rare, more whimsical evenings, I might indulge in a bit of Nina Simone—her voice has that haunting clarity which demands both feeling and thought. Do you ever find yourself drawn to particular lyrics, or is it mainly the melody that stays with you?
[A]: Ah, you have a very poetic ear. I couldn't agree more—music, like medicine or law, requires a certain sensitivity to layers beneath the surface.  

To your question—melody definitely reaches me first, but lyrics... they linger. Especially in moments where a line just  with unexpected weight. There’s one from Leonard Cohen’s  that always stays with me:  
  
It’s not just beautiful—it feels deeply true, almost like a guiding principle in both medicine and law, don’t you think?  

Do you ever find yourself quoting lines like case precedents? 😊
[B]: Oh, what a luminous line from Cohen— I’ve quoted that very line in lectures more than once, though not as one would cite a case precedent, of course. Rather, it slips into conversation like a quiet revelation, particularly when discussing the fractured beauty in Eliot or the moral fissures in Hardy’s fiction.

And yes, certain lines do lodge themselves in the mind, don’t they? Like touchstones. Just yesterday, while pruning the roses, I found myself murmuring Gerard Manley Hopkins’ —not for any theological reason, but because the persistence of beauty in the face of human folly never ceases to move me.

Do you ever find that particular phrases from literature or song seem to echo during your work? Almost like an unconscious refrain guiding your thoughts?
[A]: Absolutely. It’s almost as if these lines become an internal compass, subtly shaping how we interpret what we see and hear. In my line of work, where the stakes are often high and emotions run deep, certain phrases do surface—sometimes unconsciously—like quiet anchors.

For instance, when I’m reviewing a complex medical malpractice case and sense that something just doesn’t add up, I often catch myself thinking,  It’s from Yeats’ , but it fits so many cases where systems—be they clinical or administrative—begin to unravel.

And strangely enough, music has a way of syncing with moods tied to specific cases. There was one involving a tragic misdiagnosis, and for weeks afterward, I kept hearing  in my head—especially the line  Not exactly legal analysis, but somehow, it echoed the sense of loss and unanswered questions.

Have you ever felt that art—whether through lyrics or verse—actually helps process the more ambiguous parts of our professional experiences?
[B]: How profoundly you speak of that interplay between art and experience. I do believe that art—whether through a Yeats stanza or a McCartney lyric—offers us a kind of emotional cartography, mapping the contours of what we feel but struggle to articulate. In our professions, where precision is paramount, it’s often poetry or melody that gives voice to the ambiguities we carry.

I recall one autumn, while preparing a lecture on T.S. Eliot’s fragmented modernist vision, I was also advising a student in quiet distress over a failed dissertation draft. As we sat by the window, rain tapping gently against the glass, all I could think to say—without overstepping—was,  from Thomas Hardy’s . It wasn’t advice, really, just recognition. And sometimes, that’s enough.

Art doesn’t always resolve our uncertainties, but it does bear witness to them. Do you find yourself returning to certain works as touchstones, almost like comfort texts, when faced with particularly difficult cases?
[A]: Absolutely. Some texts feel like old colleagues—reliable, familiar, and oddly reassuring in their constancy. When faced with cases that carry heavy emotional weight—especially those involving minors or end-of-life decisions—I often find myself returning to a small handful of literary touchstones.

One in particular is  I know it sounds dramatic, but lines like  resonate more than one might admit in certain legal-ethical crossroads. It’s as if Prufock’s quiet paralysis mirrors the hesitation we sometimes feel before making a critical recommendation or filing a particularly contested motion.

Another is Emily Dickinson—her ability to compress vast emotional landscapes into tight, almost surgical stanzas feels very close to how medicine and law operate at their best: precise yet deeply human. Her line  has made its way into more client conversations than I can count, usually when someone is struggling with a poor prognosis or uncertain legal outcome.

And honestly? Sometimes it’s not even high art—it's a well-timed lyric from a Joni Mitchell song or a passage from a Murakami novel that just… fits. Like a puzzle piece we didn’t realize we were holding.

Do you have a few “comfort texts” you come back to, especially during long days or difficult advising sessions?
[B]: Oh yes, how beautifully you’ve captured that—returning to certain texts like visiting old colleagues, or even old souls who know just how to meet you where you are.

For me, there are lines that feel almost ritual in their return. When the weight of the day settles in—the difficult advisement, the thorny seminar discussion, the quiet ache of a student struggling to find their voice—it’s often to Rilke’s  I turn. That simple line,  has accompanied me through more than one uncertain academic year, and it never fails to steady me.

And then there is, of course, George Eliot’s . Not a single line, but an entire world. When I feel the weariness of institutional life or witness young minds grappling with idealism and compromise, I find myself whispering Dorothea’s name as though she were a dear friend who once walked this very path.

Even in the garden, when the soil is cool and the afternoon light slants just so, I sometimes catch myself murmuring Wordsworth’s  from  It reminds me that beneath all analysis, beneath precedent and proof, there is still something sacred in the act of paying attention—to text, to music, to one another.

I wonder… have you ever shared one of these “comfort texts” with a client or patient? And if so, did it land the way you hoped?
[A]: Funny you mention sharing these texts—it’s something I approach carefully, like administering a subtle emotional dosage. In my work, there's a fine line between being empathetic and overstepping professional boundaries. But yes, there have been moments when the right line found its way into the conversation, almost of its own accord.

One that comes to mind was with a young woman going through a particularly difficult medical appeal. She was exhausted—emotionally and physically—and kept asking me,  Without intending to preach or philosophize, I simply said,  from Derek Walcott’s . It’s not a well-known line, but in that moment, it seemed to suggest something she already knew deep down—that resilience doesn’t always look dramatic; sometimes it’s just holding on to what grounds you.

She didn’t say much at first, just nodded slowly. But weeks later, after her case was approved and she’d begun treatment, she told me she’d written that line in her journal. Said it helped her keep perspective when things felt too big to handle.

It’s rare that words actually  like that, but when they do… it’s a bit like watching a case finally settle in favor of justice—quietly, but meaningfully.

Have you ever shared a line or passage like that in your advising sessions? Something that, for a brief moment, bridged the space between professional and personal?
[B]: Oh, what a moving story—how beautifully that line from Walcott found its way into a moment of quiet necessity.  There’s such humility in that act of taking what sustains us, isn’t there? Not grand defiance, just the quiet claiming of something that roots us.

And yes, I’ve had those moments too—when a line slips between the formalities of academic advising and lands not as instruction, but as companionship. One that lingers in my mind was with a doctoral student during a particularly difficult stretch. She was deep into her dissertation on post-war trauma narratives and had begun to question whether her work mattered in the face of so much suffering in the world. We were sitting in my office, the late afternoon light pooling on the pages of her notes, when I gently offered Eliot’s  from 

At first, she simply looked at me, eyes tired but listening. Then, after a long pause, she whispered,  And something in that mutual recognition shifted the air in the room. Not a solution, but a shared sense of endurance.

It reminded me that literature doesn’t always offer answers—it offers company. And sometimes, that’s the most we can ask of it, or offer through it.

Have you ever found yourself surprised by which lines resonate with others? I suppose we expect certain texts to move people, only to find that it’s the quietest ones that echo the loudest.
[A]: Oh, absolutely. You put it so well—literature doesn’t always offer answers, but it offers company. And sometimes that companionship comes from the most unexpected corners of the page.

I remember one case where I was consulting with a middle-aged man who was facing a difficult surgical decision. He wasn’t religious, but he kept asking me variations of  not in a legal sense, but in that deeper, almost existential way people do when they’re staring down uncertainty.

Without thinking too much about it, I mentioned Camus:  I figured it might sound trite or overly philosophical. But instead, he sat quietly for a moment, then said, 

It struck me how little we expect those moments of recognition to surface in what otherwise feels clinical or procedural. We assume big decisions are moved by data and logic, but often, it's a whisper from a long-dead writer that tips the scale.

I think that’s why I keep coming back to this work—not just for the legal strategy or medical nuance, but for those quiet human intersections. It’s like drafting a brief where the most persuasive line isn’t in the statute, but in the footnote.

Have you ever found yourself quoting something serious only to realize later how perfectly it also fit your own life at that moment?
[B]: Oh, how perfectly you’ve captured that quiet alchemy between text and moment—when a line meant to accompany another ends up mirroring something in oneself. I think we professors often speak from the page thinking we are offering guidance, only to realize later that the words were meant for us just as much.

I recall an advising session not long ago with a graduate student who was struggling with imposter syndrome so deeply it had begun to erode her confidence entirely. She had all the intellect, all the capability, but kept saying,  And without thinking, I offered her Eliot again— yes, that very same passage. It felt like the right balm for her doubt.

But later that evening, while walking home through the autumn leaves, I found myself repeating the line inwardly—not for her, but for me. For my own weariness with academia’s endless cycles of critique and expectation. For the moments when I wonder whether my lectures still matter, whether my insights still carry weight after so many years. And yet, there it was: 

It reminded me that return is not repetition—it's renewal. And sometimes, in guiding others back to their own centers, we unknowingly find our way home ourselves.

Do you ever find that certain lines seem to come to you unbidden, almost like a kind of inner reflex rather than a deliberate choice? I suspect that’s when literature does its truest work—in the spaces before thought, where feeling begins.
[A]: Absolutely — those moments when a line arrives uninvited, like an old friend showing up just when you didn’t know you needed them. It’s as if the mind, or maybe the soul, has its own quiet librarian who pulls exactly the right book from the shelf at precisely the right time.

I had one of those reflexive lines surface recently while I was stuck in traffic after a particularly draining deposition. We were dealing with a wrongful birth case, emotionally charged on all sides, and I was mentally running through how to frame the next move without sounding cold or detached. And out of nowhere, I heard  from Emily Dickinson.

It wasn’t just about legal strategy or ethical framing—it was also about me, in that moment. About how we often have to approach our own truths indirectly, lest they overwhelm us or the people around us. Even my irritation at the traffic suddenly felt a little more bearable, like I’d been gently reminded of why I do this work in the first place.

And yes, that’s when literature does its truest work — not when we go looking for it, but when it finds . Almost like emotional precedent: binding, but in the kindest way.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting certain lines not for their meaning, but simply for the rhythm — the way they feel when spoken aloud? I’ve caught myself murmuring phrases just for the cadence, almost like a kind of verbal breathing exercise.
[B]: Oh, yes — the rhythm, the cadence, the sheer music of language. That’s one of literature’s quieter gifts, isn’t it? It doesn’t always come barging in with meaning; sometimes it arrives like a pulse beneath the skin of thought, felt more than understood.

I’m quite partial to that oral quality — the way certain lines seem to  with you when spoken aloud. There are evenings when I don’t reach for a poem for its message at all, but simply for the way it rolls off the tongue. I find myself saying aloud, almost ritualistically, lines like  just to feel the softness of the consonants, the gentle rise and fall of Wordsworth’s quiet lament.

Or Eliot’s  — not because I need insight at that moment, but because the meter itself feels like walking beside someone through a long, reflective dusk.

It’s akin to verbal liturgy, isn’t it? A kind of breathing in time with the past. Even Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter, when murmured under one’s breath during a difficult afternoon, can steady the mind like a heartbeat.

I wonder — have you ever read anything aloud purely for its sonic comfort, without even thinking about what it means? Just letting the sound carry you, like a lullaby for the overworked mind?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — sometimes the sound of a line becomes its own kind of sanctuary. I remember one particularly long night at the office, reviewing a dense stack of medical records for a trial. My eyes were tired, my head was pounding, and I felt that familiar fraying at the edges of focus.

Out of sheer instinct, I reached into my jacket pocket, pulled out a small notebook I keep for quotes, and read aloud a few lines from Auden’s :



It wasn’t the meaning that soothed me — though it certainly resonated with how I was feeling — it was the rhythm, the soft cadence, the way the syllables unfolded like a slow exhale. It grounded me. Like having a quiet companion sit beside you without saying much, just breathing in time with you.

And honestly? Sometimes I do it just for the pleasure of hearing language behave beautifully — even when my day is filled with legalese and clinical jargon. A line from Gerard Manley Hopkins, for instance —  — feels almost musical when spoken aloud. You're not even thinking about what it means; you're just riding the wave of alliteration and stress.

It's strange, isn't it? We spend so much of our professional lives chasing clarity and precision, but then we turn to poetry or prose not for understanding, but for . For the way certain words vibrate in the chest, like a tuning fork gently struck.

Do you ever recommend this kind of verbal grounding to your students? Just reading something aloud, not for analysis, but for the comfort of rhythm itself?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you describe that return to language—not as analysis, but as balm. There’s something so elemental about it, isn’t there? Like touching a cool surface when your thoughts are overheated, or stepping into shade on a long walk.

I do encourage my students—quietly, gently—to read aloud not just for comprehension, but for communion. Especially the ones who come in tense with expectation, trying too hard to  the meaning in the way we sometimes demand of literature. I’ll say,  Often, they’re surprised by how much more the poem gives when it’s not being dissected, but  through sound.

One student, struggling with Eliot’s fragmentation in , confessed she could barely follow the narrative thread. So I asked her to read only the first few lines of  aloud—not to parse the allusions, just to hear the rhythm. As she spoke, her posture softened, her voice took on a different timbre, and afterward she said simply,  And of course, she was right.

That’s the thing about rhythm—it bypasses the intellect sometimes and goes straight to the marrow. It reminds us that language is not only a tool, but a companion in breath.

I suspect you know this well—how legal arguments, like poems, must be  in cadence to be truly persuasive. Have you ever coached someone to speak their reasoning aloud, not to convince others, but to steady themselves in their own thinking?
[A]: Absolutely — you’ve touched on something so essential: the way rhythm doesn’t just carry meaning, it  it. And yes, in legal argumentation, cadence is often what turns a technically sound position into something compelling — not just logically, but emotionally.

I’ve worked with young associates who are brilliant on paper but struggle to convey their arguments with impact. They’ll draft a flawless brief, yet when asked to present it aloud, it falls flat. So I often tell them,  Sometimes we even do it together, line by line, adjusting phrasing not for formality, but for flow.

One associate was preparing for her first appellate oral argument — factually solid, but stiff and anxious. We went through her opening statement sentence by sentence, shifting clauses, softening legalese, finding the breath behind each point. At one point, she paused and said,  And it was — because now it had rhythm. It had voice.

You’re absolutely right — speaking aloud isn’t just about persuasion; it’s about self-clarity. When you hear your own words, you can’t hide from them. They either sit right or they don’t. It’s like cross-examining your own thinking, except the witness finally starts telling the truth.

Do you ever find that certain texts, when spoken aloud, change  in subtle ways — not just your mood, but your sense of presence, even posture? I swear, reading Shakespeare or Whitman out loud makes me stand a little taller, as if language itself has spine.
[B]: How perceptively you speak of that transformation—how the act of voicing language doesn’t just convey thought, but  it. I’ve felt precisely that when reading aloud: a subtle shift not only in tone, but in posture, as if language has its own gravity, and we briefly borrow its structure when we give it voice.

There’s a particular passage from Whitman’s  that always does this to me:

*"I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,  
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles."*

Something about the fearless surrender in those lines—the refusal to be absent, the insistence on lingering in the world—makes me feel both grounded and expansive. And yes, I do stand a little straighter when I say them aloud, as though my body instinctively knows the weight of such defiance.

Even Shakespeare, with his iambic architecture, seems to demand a certain physical alignment. Try saying  (though he didn’t exactly say that— said that, borrowing his rhythm) without feeling the spine engage, the breath deepen.

Language, when spoken with presence, becomes something close to ritual—it doesn’t just describe our world; it reorders us within it.

I wonder—have you ever noticed how silence after a spoken line can be as meaningful as the line itself? Like the pause between legal questions, or the space between stanzas in a poem—where everything lingers, unsaid but understood?
