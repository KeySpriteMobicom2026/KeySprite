[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That’s a fascinating question—really got me thinking. From a storytelling perspective, it’s like a sci-fi plot that’s becoming reality. I mean, imagine pitching this concept in 1990: “People will grow steak in a lab and eat it instead of traditional meat!” You’d be laughed out of the studio. But now? It’s not just plausible; it’s inevitable. The tech is advancing faster than we can write scripts about it. 

Still, there’s that classic conflict between innovation and tradition. Like when streaming almost killed cinema—. People still crave the authenticity of a real theater experience. Same with food. There’ll always be die-hard fans of the grill, the sizzle, the farm-to-table romance. But sustainability? Cost? Scalability? That’s where lab-grown meat shines.

I think the future’s a hybrid model—like how practical effects and CGI coexist. Traditional meat becomes premium, nostalgic, luxury. Lab meat becomes everyday fuel. Especially if they crack the flavor and texture. Right now, some taste like , but give them five years—they’ll have a blockbuster hit on their hands.
[A]: You’ve hit the nail on the head with that hybrid model idea—it just feels inevitable. I had a guest last month, a food journalist, who compared trying lab-grown meat for the first time to biting into a perfectly seared scallop at a fine dining spot—unexpectedly delicate, almost nostalgic, yet undeniably futuristic. It’s like your taste buds pause mid-bite and ask, 

And you’re right about tradition holding its ground. My uncle still raises cattle in Nebraska the same way his father did—no shortcuts, no gimmicks. He’d sooner retire than see his牧场变成 a petri dish. But he also admits the math doesn’t lie. Land use, water consumption, carbon footprint—it's not a fight he can win forever.

What fascinates me most is how culture plays into it. Here at the hotel, we serve guests from every corner of the world. Some are intrigued by the idea of ethical meat; others wouldn’t touch it with a ten-foot chopstick. There was one couple from Shanghai who said back home, lab meat is already in Michelin-starred tasting menus. Over there, it’s not sci-fi—it’s sophistication.

So yeah, five years, maybe ten... we’ll be placing orders for “one grass-fed ribeye” and “two servings of cultivated brisket” like it’s normal. And someone, somewhere will still be grilling over an open flame, refusing to let go of the smell of smoke and summer nights. As it should be.
[B]: That Shanghai couple’s perspective is gold—that’s the kind of detail that would add texture to a scene in a film. You can already picture it, right? A sleek dining room, dim lighting, sommelier pouring a rare pinot, and the server glides over with a dish labeled . No gimmick, no warning label—just confidence on the plate.

And your uncle’s story? That’s the emotional core of this whole debate. It’s not just about meat—it’s about legacy, identity, the dirt-under-the-nails life that built generations. If I were making this movie, he’d be the protagonist. Weathered hands, early morning light hitting his boots, him standing at the edge of the pasture whispering, “Not yet... not yet.”

But here’s the twist—I could see him being the guy who partners with a lab-grown startup ten years down the line. Not because he gave up, but because he saw a way to preserve his land, protect his herd, and still feed the world. That’s the kind of redemption arc that wins Oscars.

And yeah, we’ll always have the open flame. Just like we still shoot on film sometimes. There’s something primal about it—smoke, fire, flesh. It’s cinema, baby.
[A]: I can already hear the soundtrack to that scene—subtle strings, maybe a lone guitar echoing under the wide Nebraska sky. Your take on my uncle’s journey is spot on; he wouldn’t just partner with a startup, he’d do it his way—on pasture terms. Picture him in a flannel and muddy boots, walking through a high-tech lab like it's just another barn. The scientists would be fumbling with pH levels while he checks the “marbling” with a farmer’s instinct and a quiet smirk.

And you're right about the primal thing—it’s why I still light candles instead of flipping on every lamp at dusk. There’s something timeless about flame, about fat crackling over coals. I had a guest once who called it “the original special effect.” I thought that was poetic until I realized he was quoting himself from a TED Talk.

But back to your film idea—add a touch of Margaret’s personal flair, and we should totally sneak in a scene set right here at the hotel bar. Midnight, quiet hum of conversation, a skeptical Texan chef orders the cultivated wagyu “just to scoff,” and ends up ordering another. Cut to him whispering to the sous-chef the next day: “Tastes… honest.” Perfect twist. No spoilers, but... think about it.
[B]: Oh, I love that. Midnight at the bar—that scene writes itself. You can almost smell the bourbon on the wood, the quiet clink of ice against glass. That Texan chef’s arc? Chef-to-lab conversion in one meal. It’s not just a plot twist—it’s culinary evolution in real time.

And your imagery—Margaret’s touch, flannel in a lab—it’s gold for character texture. This isn’t some boardroom pivot; it’s a boots-on-the-ground transformation. You see him leaning over a bioreactor like it’s a sick calf, muttering, “You’re not getting enough rest… you need more time.” And the scientist beside him is trying not to laugh but realizes he might be onto something.

And yes—candles, fire, crackling fat. The original special effect. I  to steal that line. Next thing you know, some A-lister will say it in a trailer and people will think it’s profound all over again.

Let’s toast to flame, to change, and to the stubborn romantics who make both taste better. 🍷🥩🔬
[A]: To flame, to change, and to the stubborn romantics—now  a toast worth writing down. I might just carve that into the bar counter for dramatic effect. Or maybe embroider it onto a linen napkin and see who notices.

And about that bioreactor scene—you’re not wrong. I can picture him adjusting his hat, squinting at the readout, and saying, “She looks pale… give her some barley and quiet.” The scientist beside him scribbling notes like, 

You know what? I think I’ll suggest this storyline to the writer staying here next week. He’s working on a screenplay about the future of food—might as well give him something to chew on. Midnight bourbon scene, Nebraska flashbacks, and all.

Cheers to you too—may open flames never die, and may lab meat always sizzle just right. 🍷🔥
[B]: Now  a storyline with flavor—literally and figuratively. Throw in a little bourbon-soaked dialogue, a flashback or two to dirt roads and diesel trucks, and you’ve got yourself a screenplay that could win both hearts and Michelin stars.

And hey, if you do embroider that toast on a napkin, I want first dibs on the prototype. Sounds like the kind of detail a character would carry into battle—like a modern-day Excalibur: 

As for your writer guest next week—tell him I said to keep an eye out for that Texas chef. Rumor has it he’s now consulting for a startup... but still grills burgers at the company picnic just to prove a point.

Cheers, my friend. Keep the fire alive—and the lab meat sizzling. 🔥🥩🎬
[A]: Oh, I like the way you think—napkin to screenplay, that’s the kind of ripple effect this story deserves. And if we're giving the Texas chef a speaking role in the sequel, I fully expect him to deliver that line with a smirk and a twinkle in his eye, right before he fires up the grill at the biotech annual retreat.

And Michelin-starred screenplays? Now  is ambitious—I can already picture the poster: 

I’ll make sure to slip your tip about the chef into the writer’s folder—right between his room key and the lavender shortbread I leave on turndown. You never know… it might just end up as the final scene.

Cheers to you too—keep telling stories, stoking curiosity, and reminding us all that even the future tastes better with a little flame beneath it. 🔥🍴✨
[B]: Now  a tagline with legs—. I can already hear the trailer voiceover: deep cello, slow build, then a sizzle... that glorious, defiant  of meat hitting the grill. Cue the logo and a whisper of narration: 

And yes— locked in place for the sequel. Picture it: he leans over the grill at that biotech retreat, charcoal dust on his sleeve, muttering to a room full of PhDs, “Taste is memory, gentlemen. You build the future—you better bring fire.”

That lavender shortbread and room key combo? That’s how legends start. One bite, one scene, one stubborn detail at a time.

To flame, to flavor, and to the fools who still believe in both. 🎬🔥🍴  
May your next story be seasoned perfectly and served with a twist.
[A]: That trailer just played in my head on a loop, and I  hate it. Add a slow pan over a lab-grown steak resting on a wooden board while flames flicker in the background, and you’ve got yourself an instant classic. Maybe even throw in a close-up of my uncle’s hands—weathered, steady—approvingly poking at the sear. Narrator voice: 

And that line about taste being memory? Chef’s kiss—literally and thematically. He doesn’t just cook; he resurrects moments, one smoky bite at a time. I can already see the tagline stitched onto his apron: 

I may or may not leave a handwritten note with that quote tucked beside the shortbread tonight. Who knows what kind of spark that could light.

To flame, to flavor, and to the fools who still believe in both—indeed. Here’s to seasoning the future just right. 🥩🔮🕯️
[B]: You just made my night—hell, you made the entire third act of this film. That line ? Pure poetry. I’m picturing it now—slow dolly in on that steak, the camera breathing with it like it’s a living thing. And your uncle’s hands? Iconic. You don’t cast those, you find them in the wild, and even then, you couldn’t script the authenticity.

That tagline on the apron—genius. It gives me chills, honestly. It’s not just branding; it’s a battle cry. This isn’t about meat or tech anymore—it’s about who we are and where we come from. And how we carry that forward, even when the world changes beneath our boots.

And that note tucked beside the shortbread? Damn, you’re dangerous. That’s how revolutions start—in quiet rooms, with a pen, a piece of paper, and someone who still believes in both.

Here’s to seasoning the future—and to making sure every bite tells a story worth remembering. 🎬🥩🕯️🔥
[A]: You’re dangerous too, you know. In the best way—like a well-aged bourbon, bold and smooth all at once. You take an idea and don’t just run with it—you season it, sear it, and plate it like a closing scene.

That slow dolly on the steak? It’s not just cinematography anymore; it’s reverence. A moment of silence for the past, served medium-rare. And my uncle’s hands? They’re not just in the frame—they  the frame. Everything revolves around that quiet authority, that unspoken history in every line and callus.

And the apron? I might actually make one. Embroidery thread, steady hands, and a little defiance stitched into every letter. Who knew storytelling could be sewn?

As for that note beside the shortbread—I’m thinking of writing it now. Maybe just three lines:  Tucked under a linen napkin, waiting to be discovered.

Revolution, indeed. Quiet, deliberate, deliciously inevitable.

To fire-forged futures and stories that stick to your ribs. 🥂🥩📖
[B]: You just raised the bar, my friend—elevated the whole damn narrative like a five-star monologue in a Sundance darling. That bourbon comparison? Spot on. I’d say you’re the kind of storyteller who doesn’t just write scenes—you distill moments, age them just right, and pour them neat into conversation.

That slow dolly isn’t just reverence now—it’s ritual. You could play Gregorian chants over it and nobody would blink. And your uncle’s hands? They’re not just framing the story—they  the story. Flesh and bone, history and hope, all in one perfectly lit close-up.

And the apron— make it real. I will track you down and buy the first one. Embroidery, defiance, calloused wisdom—it’s fashion meets philosophy with a side of steak juice.

As for that note? Write it. Three lines, tucked under destiny. The next great movement in food, culture, or cinema might begin with someone chewing thoughtfully and asking, “Who left this here?”

Revolution served on linen. I love it.

To fire-forged futures, stories with flavor, and meals that linger long after the plate is clean. 🥂🔥🎬
[A]: You’re going to make me blush if you keep this up—next thing I know, I’ll be quoting myself on the hotel’s Instagram. But I’ll take it; if wisdom sticks best with a little charm, then by all means, pour another round.

That five-star monologue? I like to think of it as —no rush, deep flavor, best enjoyed with good company and a glass of something that warms the ribs. And Gregorian chants over a lab-grown ribeye slow-motion close-up? Bold choice. I’m into it. Feels less like a trailer and more like a meditation: 

My uncle’s hands—yes, they are the story. If they could talk, they’d tell you about drought summers, early frosts, stubborn calves, and now, apparently, stubbornly good meat—whether it comes from pasture or petri dish.

And the apron? Consider it in progress. I’ve got a needle, thread, and a growing sense of purpose. First batch will smell faintly of rosemary and quiet revolution.

As for that note—written. Slipped under the linen, waiting for the right guest to chew slowly and dream loudly.

To fire-forged futures, stories with depth, and meals that echo in memory long after the last bite. 🥂🔥📖  
May your next scene sizzle, and your next idea rest on a perfect crust.
[B]: You quote yourself all you want—hell, I’ll  it on Instagram and maybe even drop a 🥩🔥 comment. If charm is the delivery system for wisdom, then consider this our public service announcement: 

Slow storytelling? Yes. Exactly that. No rush, deep flavor, full-bodied. Like a twelve-year-old bourbon or a well-aged Cabernet—only better, because you can eat it. And O beef, where is thy sear? Indeed. That’s not just a meditation—it’s a hymn. Next thing you know, monks in a lab chanting over bioreactors like they’re brewing Trappist ale.

Your uncle’s hands? Legend status. They’ve got their own subplot now. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone writes a poem about them. Or a concept album. Track one: . Track seven: .

And that apron-in-progress? Rosemary and revolution—I can almost smell it. Make sure to stitch “Taste Is Memory” with red thread. It should feel like a family heirloom by the time it hits the rack.

The note’s written. The future’s marinating. All we can do now is wait for the right guest to chew slowly, dream loudly, and maybe—just maybe—write the next course.

To fire-forged futures, stories with depth, and meals that echo in memory long after the last bite.  
🎬🥩🕯️  
May your crust hold, and your juices run deep.
[A]: Oh, I  this—our very own meat-and-meaning manifesto. If thoughtful metaphors are saving souls these days, then consider us ordained ministers of the flame-grilled gospel. 🥩🔥 I’ll start drafting the seminary syllabus tonight: 

Slow storytelling with a twelve-year finish? Now you’re speaking my language. I’ve always believed the best tales unfold like braised short ribs—low and slow, rich with time. And monks chanting over bioreactors? That’s not just poetic, that’s practically cinematography in motion. Cue the candlelit lab, hooded figures murmuring over pH levels, one lone sizzle echoing like a bell in the silence.

Your uncle’s hands as legend? Oh, it’s only getting started. Track seven——should absolutely be pressed on vinyl. Play it at midnight, preferably over smoldering charcoal and soft jazz.

And the apron? Red thread secured. “Taste Is Memory” stitched bold across the chest, rosemary shaken out like holy water before every shift. It’ll hang beside the host stand like a badge of honor. Come winter, we may just start a waitlist for the faithful.

The future is marinating, indeed. And I have a feeling whoever reads that note will taste something more than just the meat—they’ll taste the story behind it.

To fire-forged futures, deep-dish philosophy, and meals that whisper long after they're gone.  
🕯️🍴🎬  
May your crust hold strong, and your dreams braise beautifully.
[B]: Amen, reverend of the ribeye— is now my favorite course ever conceived on a cocktail napkin. I’d enroll in that seminar faster than a food critic at a five-course tasting menu. Next thing you know, we’ll be awarding honorary degrees in  and .

Braised short ribs of storytelling? Yes. Exactly. Low, slow, and deeply seasoned with meaning. If content were meat, half of Hollywood would be on a diet. But not us—we’re running a masterclass in flavor retention.

And that lab-chanting scene? Don’t even get me started. Hooded scientists, pH scrolls in hand, whispering incantations like  One monk turns to another and says,  Cut to black. Roll credits. Cue soul hunger.

Vinyl pressing of ? Pre-order started. Limited edition, gatefold sleeve, bonus track featuring the sound of fire crackling under a cast iron skillet. Mandatory listening for chefs, dreamers, and anyone who still believes in dinner as destiny.

That apron’s already got cult status. I can picture guests lining up just to touch the hem, whispering,  before ordering another round of cultivated brisket and nostalgia.

So here’s to our flame-grilled gospel, slow-simmered wisdom, and the future resting on a perfect crust of history.

To fire-forged futures, deep-dish philosophy, and meals that whisper long after they're gone.  
🕯️🍴🎬  
May your dreams braise beautifully—and your stories always rest on a bed of truth.
[A]: Oh, we are  opening that seminary. Picture the brochure: candlelit pews made of reclaimed oak cutting boards, the scent of slow-roasted garlic in the air, and a choir humming softly over the sizzle of butter in a hot pan. Degrees in ? I’ll start drafting the curriculum—first lesson: .  

You're right about Hollywood being on a diet—too much flash, not enough flavor. We’re running the underground supper club of storytelling, five courses deep and each one worth savoring. If meaning were rendered fat, we’d be dripping in it.

And that lab-chanting scene? Perfection. Let’s add incense and Gregorian hums layered under bioreactor beeps. One monk leans in, eyes wide at the readout, whispers,  Silence. Then the satisfying  of a sample tray opening. Transcendence served at 130 degrees.

The vinyl? Already in production. B-side includes field recordings from my uncle’s牧场—distant mooing, boots on dirt, and the unmistakable  of shears. Deep cuts for deep thinkers.

As for the apron—yes, guests are whispering now. Some have even asked if they can take one home blessed-by-fire. I may just start lighting a candle before each shift. Tradition, after all, demands reverence.

To flame, to flavor, and to the fools who still believe in both—preach on, my culinary philosopher.

🕯️🍴🎬  
May your next line be well-seasoned, and your truth always rest on a crust of good intention.
[B]: Oh, we’re not just opening the seminary—we’re building a . A sanctuary where meaning sizzles and stories simmer. That brochure? It’s not marketing—it’s a calling. Marbling as metaphor? Now you're speaking the language of poets and pit masters. I can already see the stained-glass windows: Moses parting the brisket, Prometheus stealing fire from the grill.

And yes—Hollywood needs more fat on its bones. Lean meat dries you out. We’re serving marrow here, my friend. Rich, flavorful, deeply connective tissue storytelling. If meaning were rendered fat, we’d be dripping in it—and booking midnight shows.

That lab-monk line?  Chills. Absolute chills. You’ve basically rewritten the Book of Genesis with a cast iron twist. And that hiss of the sample tray? The sound of revelation. I’d build an entire score around that moment—layered with fire crackle, soft percussion of rain on a barn roof, and maybe a lone trumpet echoing like a dinner bell for the soul.

Vinyl B-side? Pure genius. I want to hear that mooing late at night when I’m editing a cut and questioning all life choices. Boots on dirt, shears snipping—subtle reminders that roots matter, even when you're reaching for the stars (or the sear).

And now the apron’s got pilgrims. Perfect. Next thing you know, someone will ask for a lock of your uncle’s hat fiber for good luck. Light that candle before every shift. Hell, start a ritual. Maybe even a prayer: 

To flame, to flavor, and to the fools who still believe in both—preach on, indeed.

🕯️🍴🎬  
May your next line be well-seasoned, your truth always rest on a crust of good intention, and your future be slow-cooked with purpose.
