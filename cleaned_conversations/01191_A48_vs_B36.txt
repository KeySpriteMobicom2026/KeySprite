[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! I must say, working as a concierge really leans into being a morning person – you wouldn’t believe how many travelers check in with fresh-faced enthusiasm at the crack of dawn! Though I do secretly envy those who find their creativity blooming under moonlight. Tell me, are you someone who rises with the sun or comes alive when stars twinkle?
[A]: Ah, the eternal debate of circadian rhythms 😄. Let me start by saying – if you think morning people have it figured out, try working night shifts at a morgue sometime. I’ve lost count of how many autopsies I’ve performed under fluorescent lights while the rest of the city slept... 🌙

But here’s the twist – I actually thrive in the early hours. There’s something about a quiet lab at 5:30 AM that makes my brain  into focus. Plus, have you ever jogged through empty streets before sunrise? Feels like you’re the only one in on some secret conspiracy 🏃‍♂️💨.

That said... I get what you mean about moonlit creativity. Some of my weirdest breakthroughs happened when everyone else had gone home. Ever notice how bodies tell different stories after midnight? Like they whisper secrets only night owls can hear 🔍🧾

So technically I’m a morning person who secretly loves playing detective after dark. Where do you fall on this spectrum? And more importantly – what weird habits come with your work hours?
[B]: Oh my, you’ve certainly got a fascinating perspective there! I can’t say I’ve ever thought about midnight autopsies – though I must admit, your “secret conspiracy” jog sounds absolutely magical. There’s something rather poetic about being the only soul awake in the world, isn’t there?

Now, working hotel reception does lean heavily on morning-person tendencies – early check-ins, continental breakfast spreads to arrange, that sort of thing. But truth be told, some of my favorite moments happen just after sunset. You’d be surprised how many curious travelers arrive with stories tucked under their coats and jet lag crinkling their eyes. And honestly? The hotel has this lovely hush once the sun goes down – like it’s catching its breath after a long day of comings and goings.

As for peculiar habits... Well, I do find myself checking imaginary wristwatches at odd hours, and I’ve developed quite the knack for guessing a guest’s home time zone just by the way they yawn. Oh, and I keep a little notebook by the desk where I jot down guests’ favorite teas, pillow preferences, even the way they pronounce “croissant.” It’s become something of a ritual – organizing all those tiny details into just-the-right-touches.

But goodness, I’m curious – have you ever had a body reveal something utterly unexpected under your scalpel? Something that made you rethink the whole case?
[A]: Oh, absolutely – the kind of case that makes you question everything? Let me tell you about one that still gives me chills…  

It started as a routine autopsy – mid-40s male, found dead in his apartment, no obvious signs of trauma. Initial reports pointed to cardiac arrest. Boring, right? But something didn’t sit right with me during the external exam. A faint discoloration on his back, almost like a bruise but  oddly – not the usual lividity pattern. I made a mental note and kept digging, literally.  

When I opened the thoracic cavity, things got weirder. There was internal bleeding, yes, but the heart looked... . Enlarged, for one, and there was this strange fibrous tissue weaving through the muscle. My first thought? Maybe some rare cardiomyopathy. But then came the tox screen – and it lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄.  

Turns out, he’d been ingesting low-dose industrial solvents over a period of months. Not enough to kill him outright, but just enough to mess with his organs in ways most doctors wouldn’t catch. And get this – the bruise-like mark? That was actually subcutaneous chemical burns from handling those same substances without gloves. His body had been poisoning itself from both inside  out.  

We ended up tracing it back to his job at a custom furniture workshop. He’d been using unregulated adhesives and thinners, thinking they were “safe” because he wasn’t inhaling them directly. Tragic, really. One of those cases where the truth hid in plain sight – and under layers of tissue we never think to look twice at 😕🧬  

So yeah... sometimes the dead don’t just tell stories, they expose entire hidden lives. Makes you wonder what secrets people carry around without ever knowing it, doesn’t it?
[B]: That... that absolutely floors me. To think, all those layers of a person’s life story hidden beneath skin and muscle – it’s humbling, really. You’ve got such an extraordinary gift for listening to the silent and seeing what others overlook. 

I can’t help but imagine how many lives must have crossed paths with his in that workshop. Did they know? Or suspect? There's something haunting about how close we can be to a mystery without ever realizing it. I suppose that’s why I take such care noting the little things about our guests – you never know what small detail might one day matter more than anyone expected.

Your line about the dead exposing hidden lives... Well, it makes me think of some of the guests who've stayed here over the years. There was this elderly couple who came every autumn – always asked for the same room, always left a pressed flower from the garden tucked under their key card. Beautiful tradition, or so I thought. But after the wife passed, her husband came alone – and for the first time, he left nothing behind. Just sat by the window all morning like he was waiting for someone to walk through the door.

Makes you wonder how many quiet sorrows people carry, doesn’t it? Perhaps not quite as dramatic as your case, but no less real. We’re all detectives in our own way, aren’t we? Peeking into corners, trying to make sense of what’s been left unsaid.
[A]: You know, it’s funny you mention that... Because in a way, we  all detectives – some of us just wear different kinds of coats. Yours probably smells like lavender and freshly pressed linen, while mine’s stained with formaldehyde and coffee ☕️.  

But seriously – the human body is like a hotel, in a way. Rooms upon rooms, each holding stories, secrets, traces of where someone’s been. And just like your couple with the flowers, sometimes the most telling evidence isn’t even physical. It’s the absence of something. A missing gesture. A routine broken. Those are the things that haunt you later, when you realize they were speaking volumes all along.  

I remember one case – elderly woman, seemingly healthy, died at home. On the surface, nothing suspicious. But during the autopsy, I noticed old rib fractures, healed over but unmistakable. Turns out she hadn’t fallen – she’d been restrained. Just one small inconsistency in her story led us to reopen everything, and eventually uncovered years of quiet abuse. Her nephew, who stood to inherit everything, was too smooth, too eager to close the chapter.  

So yeah, I get it. We’re not so different, you and me. You notice how someone takes their tea; I notice how someone held their body before they died. Both clues. Both part of the same larger puzzle. Maybe that’s why I keep jogging through empty streets – it gives me time to process all those silent stories.  

Tell me though – after all these years at the front desk, what’s the strangest habit or ritual  developed? Something no guest would ever guess, but keeps you sane behind the counter?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that – we really are both in the business of reading between the lines, aren’t we? And I suppose in a way, every guest who walks through our doors leaves behind a kind of imprint – not quite physical, but unmistakable if you know how to look.

As for strange habits... Well, I suppose I’ve developed a bit of a quiet ritual with keys. Not the electronic ones, mind you – those feel far too impersonal. No, I mean the old-fashioned brass keys we keep for our signature suites. Each one has a tiny number etched into it, and over time, I've started associating them with the guests who carry them. Before someone checks out, I’ll often whisper their room number to myself like a little farewell. It sounds odd, I know, but it’s my way of closing the chapter on their story here.

And then there’s the notebook I mentioned earlier – the one where I jot down quirks and preferences. Truth be told, I’ve gotten so used to it that sometimes I catch myself noting details about strangers on the street or people in photographs just out of habit. My sister says I’ve trained myself to see the world like a guest register.

But enough about me – I’d love to hear more about your morning jogs. Do you find yourself replaying cases in your head as you run? Or is it more of a reset button for your thoughts? I imagine there's something almost meditative about moving through a sleeping city while carrying all those untold stories inside you.
[A]: Oh, you’re  – most people just assume I zone out completely when I run. Truth is, it’s a bit of both, really. Sometimes I replay a case like an old film reel, turning over some tiny inconsistency that didn’t sit right in the lab. Other times, I deliberately shut it all off and focus on nothing but the rhythm – left foot, breath in; right foot, breath out. Like trying to outrun the weight of what I’ve seen, even if just for a few miles 🏃‍♂️🌬️  

There’s this one route I take through the older part of the city – cobblestones, narrow alleys, buildings that predate half the country. In the early morning light, it feels like running through layers of time. I imagine how many secrets those walls have absorbed – footsteps of lovers sneaking back before dawn, messengers carrying news that changed lives, or hell, even criminals trying to erase their tracks. Makes me feel small in the best way possible.  

And yeah… there’s definitely something meditative about it. After dissecting someone’s final moments all day, jogging gives me space to let my brain shift gears. It's like – I spend so much time inside dead bodies, I need to remind myself what it feels like to be fully alive. Wind in your hair, lungs burning, heart pounding... pretty hard to fake that kind of vitality 💪🔥  

Actually, come to think of it, I once had a runner collapse mid-stride near the riverwalk. Called emergency services, tried to stabilize him until help arrived. Turned out he’d been hiding severe heart disease behind his marathon habit. I couldn’t stop myself from asking for the medical report afterward – call it professional curiosity or just morbid fascination. His heart was twice the size it should’ve been. Beautiful, in a tragic sort of way – like it had fought to keep up with everything he demanded of it.  

Funny how life imitates death sometimes, isn't it? Or maybe they're just two sides of the same autopsy report. So... any chance you ever sneak out for midnight strolls instead? Something tells me you'd notice entirely different stories after dark 🌙✨
[B]: Oh, I love that image – you running through layers of time, chasing both answers and escape at once. And how poetic, really, that your job demands you dwell so much in stillness and silence, yet you seek motion to balance it all out. 

I suppose if I were to take a midnight stroll – which I most certainly do not often do, mind you – I’d probably end up listening more than looking. The hotel changes after dark; the walls seem to hum with different energy. Guests whisper differently when they think no one’s listening, and sometimes you can hear a loneliness in their voices that disappears by morning. 

But here’s something peculiar – I’ve noticed that people tend to be more honest at night. Maybe because they think the world is asleep and won’t judge them. I’ve heard confessions over room service calls that would make your autopsy notes look tame. Broken engagements, secret affairs, fears about dying... all spoken softly into the phone while the rest of the city snoozes on.

And yes, before you ask – I  taken notes during those late-night shifts. Not official ones, of course. Just little character sketches, really. Like the businessman who always orders mint tea but never drinks it, or the young couple who shares earbuds in the lobby like it's their own private world. I tell myself I’m keeping watch over their stories, even if I’ll never know how they end.

But now I’m curious – have you ever come across a death that felt… peaceful? Almost intentional, in a way? I suppose that sounds odd coming from someone who deals in mysteries, but I imagine even bodies have their own kind of poetry sometimes.
[A]: Now  is a hauntingly beautiful question...  

And yes – I have. More than once, actually. Funny thing is, they don’t always show up in the places you’d expect. Not just hospital beds or quiet homes, but sometimes even in the middle of chaos, there’s a kind of serenity that cuts through everything like a perfectly struck tuning fork.  

One case comes to mind – an elderly woman, found in her garden, surrounded by sunflowers. At first glance, it looked like she’d simply collapsed while tending to them. Her hands were still curled around a trowel, her face peaceful, eyes closed like she’d drifted off mid-thought. No signs of struggle, no trauma, just… stillness. When I examined her heart, sure enough, it had given out quietly – no fight, no panic. Just a soft fade-out.  

But here’s the poetic part: tucked into her apron pocket was a folded note, handwritten, addressed to no one in particular. Said something like,   

I keep thinking about that line long after I filed the report. Some people spend their whole lives afraid of how it will end, and here she was – not just accepting it, but choreographing it with grace. Like choosing the exact moment to take your final bow.  

Not all bodies whisper poetry, but when they do… it changes you. Makes you wonder if we should all be more intentional about how we leave things behind – whether it’s tea preferences scribbled in a notebook or sunflowers planted in perfect rows.  

So yeah… I’ve seen peace in death. Quiet, deliberate, almost . And sometimes, it hits harder than the mysteries.
[B]: That note... Oh, it gives me chills, doesn’t it? There’s something so profoundly human about wanting to be found in a place of beauty, surrounded by things that brought you joy. It makes me wonder how many people secretly compose those final lines in their heads, hoping life – or death – will oblige.

You know, we have a little garden at the back of the hotel – nothing grand, just a quiet corner with lavender and roses. And I’ve lost count of the guests who ask for directions to it on their last morning here. Some sit very still with a cup of tea, others take photographs like they’re trying to bottle the moment. But every now and then, someone looks at it the way that woman must have looked at her sunflowers – like they’re saying goodbye to something dear, even if just for a little while.

I suppose that’s what we all do, in our own ways. We curate our peace. Whether it’s through a handwritten note, a favourite view, or simply choosing how we want to be remembered.

And you're absolutely right – sometimes the quietest endings are the ones that stay with us the longest. They don’t demand answers or chase us down corridors of thought. They just... linger, softly, like the scent of lavender long after the guest has checked out.
[A]: You nailed it – . What a beautiful way to put it. I’ve seen people fight so hard to control how they’re remembered, but rarely do you come across someone who simply…  into their final moment with intention. Like she wasn’t afraid of being forgotten, just wanted to be found in the right place, among the right things.  

Funny you mention the garden at your hotel – makes me think of how often people try to stage their own sense of closure, even if only for an hour before check-out. Some choose a view. Others choose a scent. Hell, I’ve even had one guy request his autopsy samples be returned so he could be buried with a pocketful of his own ashes. Said it made him feel “complete.” I didn’t ask questions – just made sure it was noted in the file 📁🌹  

But yeah… those quiet endings? They haunt you differently. Not with questions or unsolved puzzles, but with this soft ache – like listening to a song that ends before it finishes resolving. You carry them in your chest, don’t you? Lingering notes of lives that chose grace over drama, poetry over proof.  

I wonder… have you ever written your own note? Or mapped out your ideal last scene? After all, if anyone’s got an eye for detail and a heart for stories, it’s you 😊
[B]: Oh... what a lovely, unsettling question all at once. You know, I’ve never quite put pen to paper, but I do think about it – not in a morbid way, but more like a daydream I visit now and then, tucked between the pages of my favorite novel.  

I suppose if I were to write that note, it wouldn’t be addressed to anyone in particular either. Just a few quiet lines about gratitude – for good books, shared cups of tea, and the way sunlight catches on old brass keys. And I’d want to be found somewhere ordinary yet deeply familiar – maybe sitting in the hotel’s reading nook with a book open in my lap, one finger still marking the page as if I meant to return any moment.

Though now that you mention it... I might just slip a pressed flower inside the cover of that book. Something subtle, something kind. A little clue for whoever finds it, should they care to wonder.

And honestly? I think that’s the loveliest part of what we do – whether you're piecing together stories from skin and bone or from luggage tags and pillow preferences. We give people a kind of witness, even if they don’t know we’re doing it. We see them, in ways they might not see themselves.

So tell me – if you  to stage your own final scene, would you want it wrapped in silence? Or would there be music playing softly in the background? 🎶💔
[A]: Ah... music. Now  is a detail worth dying for 🎵💔  

Funny you ask – I’ve actually thought about it more than I probably should. And yeah, it  have to include music. Something classical, maybe a bit melancholic, but not outright tragic. Like the kind of melody that makes you feel seen without demanding you explain why you’re crying. Maybe Arvo Pärt or Henryk Górecki – sparse, haunting, like listening to your own heartbeat through water.  

As for the setting? Not the lab, that’s for sure. Too many ghosts already haunt those walls. No, I’d prefer something outdoors. Maybe a hill I run past sometimes – just grass, sky, and a bench facing east. At sunrise, the light spills over everything like it’s rewriting the world from scratch. I’d like to go while the earth is still drafting its first sentences of the day, you know?  

And here’s the kicker – no note. None at all. Let people wonder. Let them tell their own stories about me for a change. I spend my life giving closure, so I think I’d want to leave behind just a little mystery. Maybe a half-finished crossword puzzle on my desk. Or a book with two bookmarks – one where I last read, and another slipped in at the page where I always meant to return.  

But yeah… if death has to come knocking, I’d rather it find me surrounded by quiet possibility than finality. Sunrise, music, and just enough ambiguity to keep someone thinking about me long after I’m gone 😊  

So really, I guess we both want the same thing – a moment that feels , even if only in hindsight. A final scene dressed in small, meaningful details. You with your pressed flower, me with my unfinished pages... We really are both writing poetry in the margins, aren’t we?
[B]: Absolutely beautiful… You’ve painted a scene so vividly, I can almost hear the music rising with the sun, like it’s part of the dawn itself. And no note – brilliant, really. Leaving behind just enough mystery for people to feel something  you, rather than about you. It’s such a gentle way to keep being generous, even in the end.

You know, I think that hill of yours – with its grass and sky and east-facing bench – sounds like the kind of place stories go to breathe one last time before becoming legend. And what a gift, to choose how you want to be remembered without tying it down with words. Just atmosphere. Just feeling.

I suppose in a way, we both spend our lives collecting moments that don’t belong to us – yours under scalpels and mine behind check-in desks – and yet somehow, they shape who we are. We become the sum of all those glimpses into other people’s lives, don’t we?

So if I may say… I think you’d leave behind a very good story. The kind that doesn’t wrap up neatly, but lingers – like the final chord of a piece you wish would never end.
[A]: Funny how the best stories aren’t the ones we live for ourselves, right? They’re the ones we absorb quietly, like ink on autopsy report paper or smudged handwriting in a guest book. And yeah… I’d be happy just being a chord that lingers – not too loud, not too final, just something that resonates a little longer than expected.  

You’ve got a real gift, you know? Most people just see what’s in front of them – names, files, bodies on tables. But you? You notice the weight behind the smile, the story in the pressed flower, the silence between footsteps. Hell, if I ever  vanish into the sunrise, I hope someone like you is on the other end – piecing it together with care, and maybe even slipping in a detail or two just for fun.  

And hey, speaking of stories that don’t wrap up neatly… I bet you’ve got one or two guests who still keep you up at night, don’t you? The kind who checked out months ago but never really left the building? 😊
[B]: Oh, you’re absolutely right – the best stories are the ones we absorb quietly, aren’t they? The ones that settle in without fanfare and stay tucked away, waiting for just the right moment to surface again.

And yes... there  guests who never really leave, even after their keys have been returned and their names checked off the register. One in particular comes to mind – a man who stayed with us for three weeks last autumn. Always dined alone, always asked for extra blankets no matter how warm the room was, and every evening at precisely six o’clock, he’d receive a phone call that made his tea go cold.

He seemed ordinary enough at first – polite, quiet, well-dressed – but small things began to stand out. He never left his umbrella, even when it didn’t rain. He paid in cash, yet carried no wallet. And on his last morning, he left a book behind – not just any book, but a very old copy of  by Virginia Woolf. Tucked inside was a photograph of a woman I’d never seen before, with writing on the back that read: 

I’ve often wondered who she was. A lover? A sister? A ghost from another life? And what was he still looking  – her, himself, or something else entirely?

Some guests pass through like shadows, but others... others leave fingerprints on your heart. You don’t always know why. You just know they meant something.

So yes, they linger. Like chords. Like questions without endings. And sometimes, I think that’s exactly what they intended.
[A]: Still looking…  🤔 That single line carries so much weight, doesn’t it? Like he wasn’t just searching for someone else – maybe he was trying to piece together a version of himself that fit around her absence.  

And that book – … Beautiful choice. One of those novels that feels less like reading and more like eavesdropping on the rhythm of someone’s thoughts. I can totally picture him flipping through its pages between autopsies of his own – not of bodies, but of memories. Quietly dissecting what went missing, one passage at a time.  

You know, I’ve seen similar traces in my work – personal effects tucked into pockets or bedsides, left behind . People often say objects carry energy, but I think they’re really just vessels for unfinished stories. And that photo? With such a cryptic note – yeah, that wasn’t an accident. That was a breadcrumb. A signal in a bottle.  

I wonder if he wanted someone like  to find it. Someone who pays attention. Who notices the way tea goes cold at six o’clock. Who still thinks about him now, months later, like he’s still out there walking between the raindrops with no umbrella to speak of.  

Some people check out, but never really leave the lobby, huh? They just fade into the background music, waiting for someone to ask the right question. Maybe that’s why we do what we do – so someone will  when the silence stretches too long. So someone will listen, even after the story seems over.  

Do you still have the book? 😊
[B]: Oh yes... I still have it. Tucked away on the shelf behind the front desk, right where guests never quite look. I couldn’t bring myself to reshelve it – not after everything it seemed to carry. It feels wrong to pass it along, like letting go of a secret that wasn’t mine to release.

And you're so right about the note – it  a signal. Not just for her, but maybe even for someone like me. Someone who pays too much attention, who wonders too deeply, who keeps listening long after most people have stopped hearing. I think he knew there’d be someone who wouldn’t just see the photo and shrug – someone who would sit with it awhile.

You know, sometimes I imagine what it would be like to write my own message in a book. Just a line or two, nothing dramatic, and slip it into some random volume on a rainy afternoon. Let it wait patiently for the right pair of eyes to find it years from now. A quiet conversation across time.

I suppose that’s the thing about unfinished stories – they refuse to stay buried. They keep rising, like echoes in a hallway long after footsteps have faded. And as long as someone is still listening… well, then maybe nothing ever truly ends.
