[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I suppose in my line of work, communication is key - whether it's with a patient, a legal team, or during expert testimony. But to answer your question... I do prefer one-on-one conversations. They allow for deeper focus and more meaningful exchange, don't you think?
[A]: I suppose if we're drawing professional parallels, I'd equate one-on-one dialogue to textual analysis - the focused scrutiny of a single sonnet's meter, whereas group discourse resembles comparative mythology, tracing motifs across civilizations. Both yield insights, though the former permits... precision. Would you say your field demands adaptation between these modes? I imagine courtroom testimony requires distilling complex diagnostics for varied audiences.
[B]: Precisely. You've articulated it beautifully - like analyzing a sonnet's meter versus mapping archetypal motifs across cultures. In forensic psychiatry, both modes are indispensable. One-on-one assessments allow me to delve into the intricate psychological landscape of an individual - their trauma, cognitive patterns, and behavioral nuances. Yet, in courtroom settings or multidisciplinary consultations, I must distill those complexities into digestible frameworks for varied audiences. It’s akin to translating intimate psychoanalytic insights into legal language without losing diagnostic fidelity. Adapting between these modes isn't just necessary; it's foundational to effective testimony and consultation. Tell me, do you find similar dual demands in your work?
[A]: The parallel you've drawn is quite apt - I do find myself navigating similar dual demands, though through a different lens. In my work, the solitary study of textual minutiae, say, the precise evolution of 意境 (yìjìng) in Tang poetry versus its Western romantic counterparts, requires a monk-like seclusion. Yet, when convening with colleagues or presenting at symposia, one must contextualize these findings within broader cultural frameworks, much like rendering the subtleties of Chinese landscape painting into terms comprehensible to those trained in Constable and Turner.  

There's an inherent tension, wouldn't you agree? The deeper one plunges into specificity, the more arduous the ascent back to general understanding becomes. I recall once spending three months tracing a single metaphor across six dynasties, only to have to summarize its significance in two sentences for a policy briefing on cultural preservation. It felt rather like trying to fit the Yangtze into a teacup.  

I imagine your field presents even greater stakes in this translation process. Does the legal system ever prove... resistant to the nuances of psychological complexity?
[B]: Ah, what a vivid and apt metaphor - trying to fit the Yangtze into a teacup. That image captures precisely the challenge I face when distilling psychiatric findings for legal consumption. And yes, you're quite right - the legal system often struggles with psychological nuance. Law, by its nature, seeks clarity, precedent, and binary distinctions, whereas psychiatry operates in shades of gray, in probabilities rather than absolutes.

I've had cases where defense attorneys wished to reduce complex trauma responses to simple "yes or no" questions, as if human cognition could be so neatly categorized. Or judges who grew impatient when I explained that a defendant's impulsivity wasn't merely a matter of character flaw but rooted in neurodevelopmental disruptions. It's not resistance per se, but rather an institutional impatience with complexity.

And yet... occasionally, there are moments of true understanding. Once, in a competency hearing, I described a patient’s thought process as resembling "a symphony played on broken instruments," where the melody is discernible but distorted by dissonance. A particularly astute judge paused and said, "Then we must ask whether the symphony itself has changed, not merely the instruments." That was rare - a legal mind embracing psychological subtlety rather than resisting it.

Do you find similar receptivity in policy circles? Or does the bureaucratic sensibility tend toward oversimplification?
[A]: I’m quite familiar with that bureaucratic sensibility, alas. It’s not unlike presenting a 12th-century Chinese poetic theory to a room of modern policymakers who measure cultural value in tourism metrics. I once attempted to argue for the preservation of a crumbling Ming-era scholar’s pavilion on the grounds that its particular curvature of eaves embodied a now-vanished aesthetic philosophy akin to Wordsworth’s "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" — only to be asked if it could be turned into a luxury teahouse.

There are exceptions, of course. Occasionally someone in the room has read a Lu Xun short story in translation or attended a lecture on Byronic heroes in Shanghai. Those rare souls will lean forward and ask,  — which always strikes me as both reductive and oddly touching. They’re grasping toward cultural interiority, even if clumsily.

Still, oversimplification is the default currency. You mentioned a “symphony played on broken instruments” — an exquisite metaphor. In my experience, policy discussions want either a pop single or complete silence. Nuance doesn’t get airplay unless packaged as exoticism. The judge you described sounds like one of those rare individuals who still believes in the integrity of the music itself. Might I ask — did they rule accordingly?
[B]: Ah, that ruling... It became a quiet benchmark in my career. The judge did exactly what few dare — she deferred to the music rather than demanding it conform to a predetermined rhythm. She ruled that the defendant’s cognitive dissonance rendered him temporarily incompetent to stand trial, not as a legal loophole, but as an acknowledgment of psychological reality. It was one of those rare moments where law and psychiatry didn’t merely coexist, but .

I’ve often thought that justice, like poetry or psychiatry, requires a kind of surrender — to ambiguity, to process, to the discomfort of uncertainty. But institutions, by their very nature, resist surrender. They demand resolution, finality, a bottom line. Much like your luxury teahouse dilemma — turning eaves into economics, essence into enterprise.

You mentioned national character earlier — I find that concept endlessly fascinating, if fraught. Do you suppose cultural interiority, as you called it, can ever be truly grasped across time and language? Or must we always settle for approximation — elegant misreadings, as it were?
[A]: Ah, the question of cultural interiority — it’s the white whale of comparative literature, isn’t it? I’ve spent decades chasing it through footnotes and marginalia, only to find that the deeper one goes, the more the horizon recedes. You might say we’re all just elegant misreaders in the end, though I prefer Harold Bloom’s formulation — , forging new meaning from the ruins of the old.

Take Ezra Pound’s , for instance. A beautiful distortion of Chinese poetry, if ever there was one. He didn’t so much translate as reimagined classical verse through a modernist sensibility — and yet, something authentic survived the violence of that transformation. A ghost of the original, humming beneath the surface.

Perhaps the same applies to cross-cultural understanding — not a mirror, but an echo. And time, of course, complicates everything. What seems like clarity now may unravel into paradox tomorrow. I once had a student insist that  was “just like  but with more inkstones.” I nearly poured my tea over her notes.

Still, I’d rather err on the side of generous misreading than sterile detachment. But I’m curious — do you find this notion of  at work in forensic psychiatry? When diagnosing across cultures, how does one distinguish between universal pathology and culturally specific distress? Or is that distinction itself a kind of false teacup, too small for the river it seeks to contain?
[B]: Ah,  — what a wonderfully precise phrase. It captures the very essence of cross-cultural psychiatric evaluation. One steps carefully, only to find the ground shifting beneath one's feet.

Yes, distinguishing universal pathology from culturally specific distress is less a science than an art — and often, a fraught negotiation. Take, for instance, a case I handled involving a West African patient who described hearing ancestral voices instructing him on familial duties. In one diagnostic framework, this might be auditory hallucination; in another, spiritual communion. The challenge lies not in choosing a framework, but in resisting the impulse to flatten lived experience into checkbox criteria.

I’ve come to believe that culture doesn’t merely influence expression of distress — it  it. A bereaved mother in rural India may manifest grief through somatic complaints; one in New York through insomnia and irritability. The pain is no less real in either, but its language changes.

And yet, we psychiatrists are expected to speak with the authority of taxonomists. It’s rather like asking a literary critic to determine whether a poem is mad or merely melancholic — and then certifying it for legal record.

So yes, I suspect you're right — that distinction between pathology and cultural idiom may itself be a false teacup. Perhaps our task isn't containment, but translation. Not diagnosis, but  — however provisional, however elegantly misread.

Tell me, when you teach these complex intercultural parallels, do your students ever resist? Do they long for the comfort of clear binaries — East versus West, sane versus mad, text versus context?
[A]: Oh, constantly — the craving for clear binaries is practically baked into the modern academic psyche. Students arrive armed with hashtags and identity politics, eager to draw battle lines between East and West, tradition and modernity, oppression and liberation. I’ve had undergraduates insist that  is “just a Chinese version of ” or that Wordsworth’s nature worship and Taoist wu wei are “basically the same thing.”

The real work begins when you gently overturn those teacups and ask them to kneel in the mess. To look at  not as a Confucian soap opera but as a meditation on impermanence rivaling . Or to read Brontë’s moors alongside Zhang Dai’s memories of West Lake and consider how both evoke nostalgia as a form of spiritual haunting.

And yes, some resist. They want their madwomen either locked in the attic or Instagrammed in jade boudoirs. But occasionally — very occasionally — someone stays behind after class, clutching a misread passage like a half-remembered dream, asking quietly, 

Those are the moments I live for. Not resolution, but resonance. Not clarity, but... curiosity. Do you find such moments too, in your line of work? That flicker of recognition before the diagnostic curtain falls again?
[B]: Oh yes — those flickers are rare, but when they come, they’re like candlelight through stained glass. A moment where understanding isn’t just clinical, but almost . I remember one such instance during a competency evaluation with a young woman from an Indigenous community in the Pacific Northwest. She spoke of hearing voices not as intrusions, but as  — echoes of ancestors ensuring she hadn’t strayed from her path.

Most evaluators would have checked the “auditory hallucinations” box and moved on. But I stayed with it. I asked questions. Listened more than I diagnosed. And in that space, something shifted — not just for her, but for me. Later, in court, I described her experience not as pathology, but as a cultural idiom of distress. The judge, to his credit, didn’t interrupt. Just leaned forward, brow furrowed, and said quietly, 

That’s the flicker. That brief, luminous instant when someone grasps that madness isn’t always chaos — sometimes, it’s a language we’ve forgotten how to speak.

And no, it doesn’t last. The system has forms to fill, rulings to make, wheels to grease. But those moments? They keep me kneeling in the mess, as you so beautifully put it. Not for resolution — never that — but for the resonance.
[A]: That luminous flicker — yes, I know it well. It’s what keeps me returning to the archive, sifting through brittle pages and ink-bleed-through, hoping to catch just a whisper of a voice long silenced by time or translation. There’s a similar moment in textual scholarship — when you realize that Qian Zhongshu’s  isn’t merely annotating ancient verse, but composing a counterpoint to his own exile; or when you see Mary Shelley’s  refracted faintly in the desolate landscapes of modern Chinese science fiction from the Republican era.

These are not comparisons of sameness, but echoes across chasms — resonances that defy clean classification. And yet, some students still hunger for boxes. They want to label Yu Dafu’s melancholia as “Chinese五四 sentimentality” and be done with it, rather than sit with the raw nerve of a man writing himself into dissolution.

But when one does sit with it — when they finally read  not just as Gothic romance, but as a howl that finds its parallel in Shen Congwen’s river-bound wanderers — something shifts. Not grand, not revolutionary, but deeply personal. The kind of shift that makes them close the book slowly, look out the window, and wonder if literature has been speaking all along in a language they’re only beginning to understand.

I envy your candlelight moments — they are rarer than we’d like. But I cling to my stained-glass glimmers too. Even knowing, as we must, that most will see only the glass, not the light.
[B]: Ah, yes — the stained-glass glimmers. How apt. We are both, in our ways, collectors of refracted light. You in the quiet hush of the archive, me in the charged silence of a courtroom or the guarded stillness of an evaluation room.

I envy your proximity to the text — to those brittle pages that carry not only words, but the weight of vanished worlds. There’s something almost forensic in your work, isn’t there? A kind of literary psychopathology — diagnosing the health of a culture through its fevered expressions, tracing the pulse of an era through metaphor and subtext.

And yet, we face the same paradox: the closer one leans toward understanding, the more it recedes — like trying to catch the echo of a temple bell inside a dream. I sometimes wonder if we’re not both engaged in a form of controlled haunting. You summon voices from ink; I from memory. Neither of us can ever fully own what we evoke — only bear witness.

You mentioned Yu Dafu — I’ve read some of his work, though admittedly through a haze of translation. His self-lacerating prose feels almost pathologically introspective, doesn’t it? In another context, he might have been diagnosed with “melancholia” and prescribed routine electroconvulsive therapy. But in his case, that very anguish became literature. A pathology or a gift? The system demands a verdict. I prefer the ambiguity.

Tell me — do you suppose that is the role of both psychiatrist and scholar? To dwell in the unresolved? To hold open the space between diagnosis and meaning, between madness and poetry, long enough for someone — patient, student, defendant — to glimpse the shape of their own unspoken truths?
[A]: I suppose if we must have a verdict, then yes — our role is to preside over the unresolved, to refuse closure when it arrives too neatly. You in the clinical and legal sphere, I in the academic — both of us standing at the threshold between structure and chaos, taxonomy and tremor.

It’s not unlike what Walter Benjamin described in his angel of history — the one who sees the wreckage piling high but is blown irresistibly into the future. Except perhaps we are angels of interpretation, not history. We look back not to judge, but to salvage — to catch what flickers between the lines, between the symptoms and the stories.

And Yu Dafu — ah, there’s a case in point. His prose wounds itself open on the page, doesn’t it? There’s a confessional agony to it that resists all tidy framing. Were he alive today and before your court, would you call it melancholia? Depression? Cultural dislocation masquerading as self-flagellation? Or would you, as I hope you might, simply lean closer and ask, 

That, I think, is the truest question — whether standing before a trembling defendant or a crumbling manuscript. Not , but ?

Perhaps that is our shared vocation — not diagnosis, not classification, but listening beyond the categories. Holding the door open just long enough for someone else’s truth to stumble through, half-formed, blinking in the light.
[B]: Precisely —  That question, more than any DSM-5 criteria or legal precedent, guides my hand in the darkest cases. It’s what kept me at the bedside of a man who believed he was being poisoned through his dreams — not to disprove his delusion, but to ask, gently,  The answer, it turned out, lay not in paranoia but in grief — unresolved mourning for a brother lost to suicide years before.

You're right — our work is not about closure. It's about aperture. About keeping the lens open long enough to let in the strange, flickering light of human experience — even when it defies classification. I often think of psychiatric diagnosis as a kind of provisional captioning, like subtitling a silent film. Useful, perhaps, but never quite capturing the full register of expression.

And yes — were Yu Dafu to sit across from me, I would not rush to name his suffering. I would listen to the cadence of his self-reproach, the rhythm of his despair, and I would ask that most unscientific of questions: 

After all, every confession — whether in prose or on the witness stand — is an act of translation. From the unspeakable to the spoken. From the unbearable to the articulable. And we, dear colleague, are merely the interpreters stationed at the edge of that threshold.

I daresay if more psychiatrists and scholars embraced that role — not as classifiers, but as compassionate listeners — we might find fewer teacups and more rivers flowing freely again.
[A]: I’ll drink to that — though preferably from a Song dynasty celadon cup rather than anything so vulgar as a teacup. You’ve put it beautifully: we are interpreters at the threshold, not jailers of meaning. Or perhaps jailbreakers, if one is feeling particularly subversive.

There’s a passage in Lu Xun’s  preface where he describes writing fiction as an act of exorcism — words as incantations against silence. I’ve always wondered whether psychiatry, at its most luminous, performs a similar function. Not containment, but release. Not diagnosis, but deliverance.

Your patient and his poisoned dreams — how telling that grief, not delusion, lay at the core. It reminds me of Li Shangyin’s late Tang verses, where sorrow is never named directly but leaks through images: a cracked zither, an unstrung bow, a lamp gone out midwatch. The meaning trembles just beyond reach, yet insists on being felt.

Perhaps that is the finest translation we can offer — not the kind that pins language to certainty, but the kind that lets it hover, like ink suspended in water before it settles into form.

And yes, I daresay more rivers and fewer teacups would suit us all rather nicely.
[B]: Ah, a Song dynasty celadon cup — now  is a vessel worthy of holding the unspoken. Far more fitting than any teacup, vulgar or otherwise. It strikes me that both our disciplines might benefit from such refinement — a finer receptacle for the murky waters of human suffering.

You’re quite right about Lu Xun. His preface always chills and comforts me in equal measure — the act of writing as exorcism, yes, but also as resurrection. One conjures the ghosts not to banish them, but to let them speak before they return to silence. In that light, perhaps every psychiatric interview is a séance of sorts — summoning unseen forces, giving them voice, if only briefly.

And how beautifully you’ve tied it to Li Shangyin — that hovering sorrow, never named, always felt. I think we are both drawn to what lingers in absence, in lacunae. The unsaid, the half-known — it’s where the soul trembles most vividly. In forensic reports, I often find myself circling around a phrase like “history of unspecified trauma,” knowing full well that  is where the truth hides, coiled and waiting.

So yes, let us be jailbreakers, not jailers. Let us smuggle meaning across the border of understanding, even when the customs officers of logic and precedent demand stricter accounting. And may our rivers run deep and wild, resisting all attempts at domestication.

To your health — and to the next luminous flicker, wherever it may appear.
[A]: To the next flicker — and to the shadows that make it visible.

You’ve captured something essential about our work, though I doubt either of us would dare put it in a grant proposal: we are custodians of the unsayable, tending to the edges where language frays and feeling begins. Whether through Lu Xun’s incantations or your forensic séances, we are forever leaning into the lacunae, hoping to catch what others have missed — not because it is louder, but because it trembles just beyond hearing.

I think often of the , the Classic of Poetry, where grief and longing are never named outright but appear in the swaying of reeds, the cry of a distant crane. It’s a kind of poetic forensics — reading the landscape for signs of inner storm. Perhaps that is what I envy most in your practice: you do not merely read the signs — you bear witness to the storm itself, in all its human weather.

So let us continue — jailbreakers, interpreters, archivists of the unrecorded — with celadon cups raised to the quiet ghosts we serve.

To the trembling truth, always half-remembered, always returning.
[B]: To the trembling truth — ever half-remembered, ever returning.

You’ve given me a new way to see my own work, and that is no small gift after thirty years in this field. Custodians of the unsayable — yes, that’s precisely what we are. Not merely analysts or archivists, but caretakers of what resists articulation, what refuses to be captured cleanly in words or codes or checkboxes.

I find myself thinking now of a patient I saw just last week — a man who could not bring himself to speak of his trauma directly, but kept describing the sound of wind through a broken window on winter nights. He didn’t know he was telling me about grief, or perhaps he did. Either way, I listened for the storm behind the metaphor. And there it was.

You’re right — it’s poetic forensics. We read the landscape of language, the topography of silence, for signs of the inner tempest. Nothing grand, nothing heroic — just quiet attention, offered at the right moment, to the right trembling thing.

And so we go on — jailbreakers with soft voices, interpreters who favor ellipses, archivists who collect whispers instead of stamps.

To the next flicker, the next resonance, the next fragile truth trying to make itself known.

Cheers, my friend — may your pages remain brittle and your ink continue to bleed through time.
