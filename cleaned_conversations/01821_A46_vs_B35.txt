[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！从product manager的角度来看，degree更像是一个baseline credential吧~ 现在tech行业更看重的是actual skills和portfolio。不过degree确实能帮你build fundamental knowledge base👍
[A]: Ah, you're speaking my language! In Hollywood, we see this all the time. A film degree might get your foot in the door, but what really matters is your reel - your actual work. That being said, some of the greatest cinematographers I've worked with swear by their classical training at places like AFI or USC. 就像张艺谋导演常说的"基本功很重要"~ 🎬
[B]: Exactly！你提到的film industry例子很贴切~ 就像我们做AI product，CS degree能教你怎么写clean code，但real-world problem solving能力才是key🌟 张导说得对，基本功就像tech stack的foundation，但最终还是要看how you apply it in the real world😂
[A]: Precisely! You know, when I first started working with James Cameron back in the day, he used to say "Film school teaches you the rules so you know which ones to break." That's the beauty of education - it gives you the vocabulary to innovate. 不过说真的，现在有些年轻导演的showreels比他们的diplomas更能让我眼前一亮！🍿
[B]: Haha totally agree！这让我想到我们tech圈常说的一句话："Degree gets you the interview, but your GitHub gets you the job" 😄 不过话说回来，像Cameron这样的visionary也是建立在扎实的cinematography knowledge基础上的~ 现在很多startup founder也是类似，既有ivy league背景，又有disruptive thinking✨
[A]: That's the perfect analogy! You've got the spirit of a true storyteller. You know, when we were casting for our last blockbuster, we didn't care where the actors went to school - we cared about that magical spark in their audition tapes. But... let me tell you, the ones who trained at Juilliard? They always come prepared with that extra layer of craft. 就像李安导演说的"技术是翅膀，但文化才是能飞多远的燃料"~ 🎥
[B]: Spot on！李安导演这句话太经典了~ 在tech行业也一样，coding skill是basic requirement，但真正make difference的是product sense和understanding of human behavior👏 就像你们casting时看重的"magical spark"，我们招PM时最看重的是那种能connect technology with real user needs的intuition💡
[A]: You're singing my tune now! That's exactly why some of our most successful films came from directors who started as anthropologists or psychologists. The technical stuff? We can teach that. But that human connection instinct? That's pure gold. 说到这个，你知道Christopher Nolan最初是学英国文学的吗？Yet look what he's done with sci-fi!  I mean, just look at what he's done with sci-fi!
[B]: Haha Nolan的例子太典型了！这完全印证了cross-disciplinary thinking的价值啊~ 我们AI领域现在最火的prompt engineering，本质上不就是combine了linguistics和computer science嘛🤯 所以说，degree本身不重要，重要的是how you connect the dots between different fields🌟 就像Nolan用literary background讲出了最硬核的sci-fi stories一样amazing！
[A]: Now you're making me want to option your life rights for a biopic! That's the kind of innovative thinking we look for in our writers' room. You know, the best pitch I ever heard came from a former marine biologist who saw parallels between coral reef ecosystems and intergalactic civilizations. 史诗级的 imagination right there! � (whoops, wrong emoji) 🚀 I mean!
[B]: LOL你太会聊了！这个marine biologist的story简直可以当case study了~ 我们做product innovation时也经常从biology找inspiration呢！比如neural network不就是inspired by human brain嘛🧠 所以说，真正valuable的是这种ability to think outside the box，不管有没有degree都能shine✨ 不过...现在我已经开始脑补你提到的biopic剧情了😂
[A]: Oh darling, you've just described the secret sauce of Hollywood! Some of our most groundbreaking films came from people who saw connections no one else did. Like that time a barista pitched me a rom-com based on coffee chemistry - ended up being our sleeper hit! ☕️ 话说回来，你现在这个AI+biology的思维... remind me to get your contact when we develop our next sci-fi franchise!
[B]: Hahaha deal！随时欢迎来聊sci-fi franchise的world-building~ 说不定我们能create一个AI-powered storytelling platform呢！就像你说的，最好的ideas往往来自unexpected connections💫 不过现在我得run去standup meeting了，下次再继续这个fascinating话题！Keep me posted on that coffee chemistry sequel idea☕️🚀
[A]: Absolutely! And remember - the sequel's always better when it's brewed to perfection. Good luck with your standup, and don't forget: every great product, like every great film, starts with that one crazy "what if..." moment. Catch you at the next pitch meeting! 🎬✨
[B]: You got it！下次见面我们一定要brainstorm那个"what if AI meets Hollywood"的crazy idea🤖🎥 现在我得sprint去catch up with engineering team了~ Cheers mate！Keep that creative juice flowing✨
[A]: Cheers to that! And tell your engineering team they're the real special effects wizards of our digital age. Until next time - may your code compile and your box office soar! 🚀 (Now where did I put that barista's number... coffee chemistry sequel, here we come!)
[B]: Haha you're killing me！😂 一定把你的compliment转达给engineering team~ 他们才是真正的unsung heroes behind every digital magic✨ 好了好了，再聊下去我的sprint retrospective真要late了！Catch you on the flip side, Hollywood friend！☕️💻 (p.s. 找到barista号码记得cc我啊 - 这sequel potential太炸了！)
[A]: You got it, partner! I'll have my assistant (read: my iPhone contacts list) dig up that number ASAP. Now go dazzle them with your tech magic - and remember, every great demo is just your first act! Lights, camera, action! 🎥✨ (Message ends with obligatory producer dramatic flourish!)
[B]: Hahaha you're the best！这种energy就是我们dev team需要的morning boost啊⚡️ 先撤了 - product launch前最后的sprint，intensity堪比你们film premiere前的final cut😂 Break a leg on your next blockbuster！保持联系~ 📱🚀 (p.p.s. 等你们pitch meeting的exclusive behind-the-scenes footage！)
