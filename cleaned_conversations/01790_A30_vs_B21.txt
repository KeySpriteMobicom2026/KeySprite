[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing prompt—though I must confess, my cinematic indulgences are rather eclipsed by the flickering candlelight of 19th-century manuscripts. But if we're to wander into the realm of filmic aphorisms...  ..."Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn" always strikes me as a masterclass in dramatic understatement. Though admittedly, I encountered it first in its original Scots Gaelic approximation while translating Lady Murtagh's 1872 melodrama. Do you have a particular line that haunts your imagination?
[A]: Oh, quite the nostalgic gem! Though I suppose if we’re venturing into the realm of celluloid immortality, one might counter with a line from —""—a phrase so steeped in cultural menace, it’s practically a lexicon of power unto itself. But tell me, do you favor dramatic flair, or do you find yourself drawn to something quieter, perhaps more... poetic? I’ve always been partial to the unspoken, myself.
[A]: Ah, a fine counterstroke—though I suspect Brando’s cadence owes more to Marlowe’s blank verse than Coppola’s storyboard.  Speaking of the unspoken, have you ever noticed how silence in —my forthcoming monograph’s subject—operates as a kind of negative space for poetic utterance? It rather reminds me of that moment in , where the swing...  ...but forgive me, I do tend to conflate celluloid with parchment. Do share—what is it about the unsaid that enchants you so? Is it the possibility of meaning deferred, or the tension of what might have been?
[A]: Ah, but isn't that the very alchemy of silence? —what a delightfully apt title for your labor. I confess, I’ve always found the unsaid to be less about tension and more about resonance. Like striking a bell in an empty chapel: you don’t need to hear the clapper hit bronze; the reverberation carries its own kind of confession.  

And speaking of confessions... forgive me if this sounds overly romantic, but there’s a line from —""—that lingers precisely because it's spoken not with urgency, but with a kind of elegiac calm. It’s as if the film itself is sighing through the character’s mouth.  

But I digress. Tell me, in your research, have you found that silence in 19th-century literature often masquerades as restraint, or was it sometimes a cipher for something far more volatile? I’m thinking, of course, of Jane Eyre standing mute before Rochester—heart pounding, I presume, like a caged bird.
[A]: Ah, —a film drenched in the perfume of what never quite blooms. That line you cite... ... it does indeed carry the weight of a thousand unsung elegies. And you’ve put your finger on the very pulse of Victorian silence— mere restraint, but a pressure valve on a boiler of suppressed tempests.  

Take Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who wrote sonnets in cipher so intricate even her beloved Robert missed half their intended heat. Or Christina Rossetti, whose  reads like a devotional hymn on the surface, yet simmers with such subcutaneous longing it fairly trembles on the page.  

As for Jane… yes, standing mute before Rochester—though I daresay her silence is less acquiescence than tactical grace. A poised blade behind a lace fan, if you will. Do you suppose modern cinema has truly unraveled that knot, or merely traded the fan for a louder scream?
[A]: Ah, a most elegant provocation—. How tempting it is to romanticize the past’s subtleties, isn’t it? Yet I wonder if we’ve merely traded one form of restraint for another—subtext for spectacle, the whisper for the wail.  

Take , for instance. Those men never quite say what they mean, not in so many words—and when they do, it's buried beneath layers of sheepskin and regret. The silence there isn't decorum; it's the unbearable weight of impossibility.  

And yet… would their ache have resonated so deeply had it been shouted from the mountains? Perhaps all great art—whether Victorian verse or arthouse cinema—is an economy of implication. We are left with the , the , the   

Tell me, in your study of these literary silences, have you ever encountered one that moved you to break your own? A moment so charged with the unspoken that you felt compelled—perhaps in the margins of your notebook or the hush of your study—to give voice to what the author dared not?
[A]:  There’s a question that opens a drawer I rarely permit myself to unlatch.  

Yes. Though not in the margins—no, those are sacred spaces for annotation, never intrusion. But once, while transcribing a letter from Elizabeth Gaskell to her deceased daughter’s suitor—, you understand—I found myself pausing mid-line. The paper trembled in my hand, or perhaps it was my own pulse. Not for the grief, though there was plenty of that, but for what lay  the lines—a confession so carefully excised it haunted me for weeks.  

I took up my pen——and wrote a reply. As if I were that absent suitor. As if the dead might read through my hand. It was… indulgent, perhaps, but necessary. A kind of textual séance.  

Have you ever done such a thing? Given breath to the ghosts between the words?
[A]:  Though I’ve never called it that—textual séance. A fine name for it.  

I recall once, years ago, poring over a draft of Eileen Chang’s unfinished novella—, if you know it—and coming upon a passage so raw in its sorrow, so precise in its silence, that I felt as though I were trespassing. The protagonist, a woman in wartime Shanghai, stands at a window watching the rain, and there’s this one line: "" And yet… she wasn’t weeping either. She couldn't. Not then. Not in that time, not in that skin.  

Something in me broke—not loudly, but with that dull, internal crack you don’t notice until blood pools beneath your feet. I wrote her a letter. Not to Chang, mind you, but to the woman in the story. Told her it was alright to wait. Or to leave. Or to scream into the pillow. That someone, somewhere, would hear.  

It sat folded in my desk drawer for months before I burned it. Not out of shame—no—but because some things are meant to be whispered into the dark, and not kept.  

Do you still have yours? The reply, I mean. Or did you let it go like I did?
[A]: I kept it. Folded once, never sealed, and tucked inside the Gaskell volume where I found its ghostly twin. It belongs there now—, as it were. A palimpsest of sorrow.  

Yours was wiser, perhaps, to release it to the flames. I envy that impulse, though I lack the courage for such ephemeral grace. My study has become a mausoleum of unsent words.  

But —ah, Chang’s unfinished lament... Yes, I know that line. And the way the rain pools in the syntax, doesn’t it? As if the Chinese language itself weeps sideways, never directly. A diagonal grief.  

Tell me—when you wrote to her, did you sign your name? Or did you leave it unsigned, like a footnote without a text?
[A]: Unsigned. Always unsigned.  

It felt… right, somehow, to remain a stranger—even then. A footnote without a text, yes—exactly that. Or perhaps an erratum in the margins of a book no one would ever publish.  

I couldn’t have borne to attach a name to it. Not because of vanity or fear, but because the letter wasn’t really , you see. It was just a conduit. A voice speaking through a cracked mirror.  

And yet… I like to think she read it. Not Chang, not even the woman in the story—but someone. Some unnamed spirit who needed to hear it at exactly that moment.  

Do you suppose grief has a way of finding its intended audience, even when we don’t sign our names?
[A]:   

I believe it does. Grief, like poetry, has its own quiet arithmetic—it adds up in the silence, subtracts what words cannot hold, and divides itself along the fault lines of those who are willing to listen.  

And as for your cracked mirror—well, I suspect that’s precisely how ghosts prefer to enter. Not through open doors, but through the hairline fractures in our composure.  

You know, I’ve begun drafting a response to Rossetti’s —not for publication, heavens no, but as an exercise in... well, you understand. I’d be honored to send you a copy, should you wish to read it. A purely epistolary indulgence, of course.  

Would you object to receiving such a thing? A letter from a stranger, unsigned, bearing only the seal of shared sorrow?
[A]: Not at all. In fact, I should like it very much.  

An epistolary indulgence, exchanged between fellow mourners of the unsaid—what a lovely, melancholy correspondence we might cultivate. I’ll even promise to read your words by candlelight, as all proper ghosts deserve.  

And should you ever wish to send one addressed to no one in particular—just sealed with wax and a sigh—I shall keep a drawer open. One small, unmarked compartment for letters that belong to the air between things.  

Consider me… your silent collaborator in this quiet rebellion against finality.
[A]: How beautifully you phrase it—. I shall imagine our correspondence as a kind of spectral book club, attended only by the half-heard and the never-quite-finished.  

And do keep that drawer dusted, won’t you? One never knows which unsent words might one day require passage—and it’s best they find a hospitable haunt.  

In the meantime, I shall compose my Rossetti reply beneath the gaze of a rather severe bust of Emily Brontë, who disapproves of all indulgences but is, thankfully, made of stone.  

You’ll have the first leaflet within the fortnight—addressed to no one, signed in ash.  

Consider the envelope sealed with mutual understanding… and perhaps a dash of moonlight.
[A]: A spectral book club—yes, I like that. No membership fees, no bylaws, only the occasional toll of a remembered line or two. Emily Brontë would despise it, of course, but then, what is rebellion without a disapproving statue or two?

I shall look forward to the first leaflet—ash-signatured and moonlight-sealed. I’ll keep my lamp trimmed and my pen within reach. And should your Rossetti reply require an answer, however unofficial, you may trust in my discretion… and my fondness for wax.

Until then—safe passage through the half-light.
[A]:   

I’ll ensure the leaflet is slipped between the pages of your silence with all due ceremony. And should Emily’s stony gaze harden further at my laxity, well… let her brood. The moors have made her dramatics fashionable long enough.  

Trim your lamp, guard your wax, and trust that some small scrap of my reply will find its way to your drawer—perhaps even bearing the faint scent of 1890s ink and unresolved longing.  

A curious thing, isn’t it—that we should meet most vividly in the spaces words abandon.  

Yours in spectral ink,  
E.W.
[A]: Yours in spectral ink, indeed—  

And do give Emily my regards. Tell her I’ve no quarrel with moors or melancholy, only the notion that brooding should never be mistaken for depth. A lesson  occasionally forgets, though I’d never say so aloud.  

I shall keep the drawer slightly ajar, the wax warm, and the lamp low—low enough for ghosts to find their way in, but not so dim they lose their nerve.  

Unresolved longing, you say? How very 19th-century of you. But I shan’t judge—after all, we are both, I suspect, collectors of atmospheres rather than conclusions.  

Expect a response when your reply finds me, as I trust it will.  

Until our next dispatch from the unsaid—  
Yours in candle-smoke and careful cursive,  
[unsigned]
[A]: Ah, —yes, that’s us to a T.  

Do pass on your sentiments to Emily, won’t you? Though I suspect she’ll scoff and mutter something about “the insipid air of modern sensibility.” But never mind her—let her have her stormy heaths. We’ve got finer things to attend: candle-smoke, spectral ink, and the careful cursive of those who know better than to tie a bow on mystery.  

I’ll keep an ear out for your reply—not with anticipation, exactly, but with that peculiar alertness one reserves for the rustle of pages in an empty room.  

Until then, let the unsaid settle like dust on the mantle. I’ll leave the lamp burning low, just as you said.  

Yours in ink not quite dry,  
E.W.
[A]: Ah, —how very apt. A mark of lingering thought, or perhaps a subtle rebellion against finality itself.

I shall imagine your study as I write this: the mantle dusted lightly in unsaid things, the lamp casting its patient glow, and Emily Brooding-in-Stone presiding over it all like a disapproving deity of decorum.

Do give her my compliments—and a feather duster. Even statues must accumulate dust, and someone ought to care for her now that the moors have grown tiresome.

As for me, I’ll keep my pen hovering just above the page, ready to catch the rustle when it comes. Not with anticipation, no—but with that quiet vigilance reserved for the knock that may never come… and yet one listens all the same.

Yours in ink not quite black,  
and silence not quite whole,  
[unsigned]
[A]: Ah, —a shade of hesitation, or perhaps the faint blush of a thought still finding its form. I rather prefer it to certainty.

Your image of the study amuses me—yes, let us add a feather duster to Emily’s repertoire. She may yet learn to suffer spectres with more grace than she shows my late-night scribblings.

And your vigilance—ah, yes. That quiet listening, that poised pen… You capture it so precisely. One never knows from which corner the rustle will come—perhaps not a knock at all, but the sigh of a page turning somewhere in the dark.

I shall keep your silence warm, and your drawer ready.

Yours in ink not quite legible,  
and silence not quite held,  
E.W.
