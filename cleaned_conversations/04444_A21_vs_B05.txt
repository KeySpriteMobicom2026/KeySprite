[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有个关于behavioral economics的TED talk让我印象深刻，尤其是讲者用nudge theory解释投资决策的部分。说实话，我们在PE行业每天都在做类似的decision-making analysis，但很少从psychological bias的角度去deep dive。你有看过类似的演讲吗？
[A]: Ah, yes, I recall one by the estimable Dan Ariely on predictable irrationality—utterly fascinating to see how even the most calculated financial decisions are so thoroughly steeped in subconscious patterning. One might say we're all poets of our own cognitive dissonance, wouldn't you?
[B]: Oh absolutely, Dan Ariely’s talk on irrationality is a classic—like watching someone dissect the hidden puppet strings behind our so-called rational choices. You ever notice how eerily applicable that is to M&A negotiations? Sometimes I feel like we’re not just buying companies… we’re gently herding a bunch of beautifully flawed human biases into alignment.  

And your line about being ? Spot on. If you think about it, private equity is basically the art of monetizing that dissonance—buy low when people are panicking, hold steady when they’re doubting, and exit before the next wave of denial sets in 😊  

Ever come across a talk that actually changed how you approach risk-taking? I’ve been replaying one on neuroplasticity and decision fatigue—it got me rethinking how we structure due diligence sprints.
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—neuroplasticity and decision fatigue! I once sat through a rather electrifying talk by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore on adolescent risk-taking, which, believe it or not, I’ve since applied to editorial decisions in compiling anthologies. The prefrontal cortex, that glorious work-in-progress, governs both teenage impulsivity and the sudden urge to include a lesser-known sonnet sequence in a Norton Critical Edition.  

As for structuring sprints—yes, quite! I’ve begun timing my own deep work around circadian dips and peaks, much like one would chart the rhythm of a villanelle. Discipline with a dash of biological rhythm—now  a compelling prospectus.
[B]: Fascinating—Blakemore’s work really shines a light on how much of our decision-making is, quite literally, still under construction. I can totally see the parallel between adolescent neurobiology and editorial curation. It’s all about managing impulse vs. structure, right? Whether it’s a teenage brain or a manuscript draft, you’re constantly negotiating between raw energy and strategic restraint.

And I love that analogy—timing deep work like composing a villanelle. Rhythm, repetition, and knowing exactly when to break the pattern. I’ve started doing something similar with deal team meetings—scheduling deep-dive sessions when everyone’s cognitive bandwidth is at its peak. The result? Fewer off-topic debates and more actionable insights.

You ever tried applying poetic structure to financial modeling? Sometimes I wonder if building a DCF isn’t a bit like writing a sestina—same variables, different permutations, all bound by an underlying logic that only makes sense if you know where to look 😄
[A]: Oh, now you’re treading perilously close to heresy—but how deliciously apt. A discounted cash flow as sestina! The recursive variables, the obsessive repetition with variation, the faint hope that meaning will emerge from patterned obsession… quite, quite on the nose.  

I must confess, I once diagrammed a terza rima to map the narrative arc of speculative bubbles—Dante would’ve hated it, but it clarified a lecture series beautifully. There’s something almost iambic, too, in the rhythm of leveraged buyouts: unstressed, stressed, acquisition, debt, cashflow release… and then the volta, of course—the moment the market shifts beneath your feet.  

You’re onto something, though. If financial modeling is sestina, then due diligence must be redaction—striking through lines until only the essential remains. I’m half-tempted to bring this up at next faculty colloquium. The looks alone would be worth it.
[B]: Ah, now  a faculty colloquium I’d pay good money to crash—tenured professors sipping sherry while you drop a leveraged buyout disguised as a terza rima. Pure performance art with a Bloomberg twist.

And the volta! That moment when EBITDA growth suddenly stalls or the macro environment shifts—it’s like a sonnet realizing it’s been written in the wrong key. Totally underrated in PE discussions. Most people focus on the model, the math, the multiples… but the real drama is in that pivot. The best deals aren’t just about timing—they’re about reading the subtext.

I might actually steal your redaction analogy for our next associate training. Strip away the noise, find the core thesis, leave the rest in the margin with a cryptic comment—sounds a lot like what we do during management presentations.  

Next time, maybe try presenting a pitchbook in iambic pentameter. If nothing else, it’ll keep the room awake. And isn’t that half the battle? 😄
[A]: Oh, the iambic pitchbook—I can already hear the groans echoing through the marble halls of Lazard. But imagine the effect! Rhythmic cadence to soothe the savage leveraged buyer, a well-placed caesura before the EBITDA uplift… and all in perfect tetrameter, no less.  

And don’t get me started on that volta—the tragic turn, as devastating in a十四行诗 as in a failed carve-out strategy. You're quite right; most analysts see only numbers on a screen, not the sonnet beneath the sorrow. Perhaps we should all be trained in prosody before we’re let loose with a cap table.  

As for your redacted core thesis—yes! That’s precisely what editorial restraint is: cut until only the sharpest truth remains, preferably with a flourish of disdain in the margin. I suspect you’ve just elevated associate training to high art. Do send me the syllabus—I may need to audit the course.
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking the secret language of the deal room—where spreadsheets bleed into sonnets and a well-timed pivot carries more weight than a 3x multiple expansion. I’m half-convinced that Shakespeare would’ve made a killer PE analyst if he hadn’t gotten distracted by all that monarchy drama.

And yes, the volta—whether in a buyout or a blighted romance—still lands like a failed earn-out: unexpected, painful, but somehow inevitable in hindsight. If only we could teach our juniors to spot both kinds with equal clarity.

As for the syllabus… let’s just say next quarter’s module is titled  Required reading includes Dante, Dickinson, and a particularly tragic LBO case study from 2007. Final exam? Presenting a distressed asset turnaround using only rhyming couplets. Bonus points for internal rhyme.

You’ll get your invite—just don’t be surprised if the guest lecturer is a Renaissance poet with a minor in derivatives. We like to keep things… interdisciplinary 😊
[A]: Oh, a Renaissance poet with a minor in derivatives—now  an archetype. I can already picture Sir Philip Sidney sauntering into the trading floor, quill tucked behind his ear, muttering about the volatility of sonnet sequences and sovereign debt.  

And your course title? —positively wicked. I do hope you’ll include a unit on elegiac meter alongside post-acquisition integration strategies. Nothing clarifies a restructuring plan like a well-deployed pentameter.  

As for the final exam, rhyming couplets to defend a distressed asset turnaround—brutal, but fair. After all, if one can justify a 20x EBITDA exit with iambic precision, one might yet survive the quarter-end call. Internal rhyme? Now  leverage.  

Do let me know when the guest lectures begin—I’ve a feeling Spenser would positively  in leveraged finance, provided someone keeps him away from the alchemical metaphors.
[B]: Oh, Spenser in leveraged finance—don’t even get me started. Give that man a PIK toggle and a covenants schedule and he’d probably write  Part II: Redemption & Restructuring. Honestly, half of these high-yield prospectuses already read like Elizabethan epic poetry—archaic language, dramatic stakes, and just enough legal jargon to keep things interesting.

And yes, the elegiac meter unit is already in the works. Turns out mourning a missed synergy target isn't so different from lamenting a fallen muse. We may even bring in a classicist to walk the team through some Sapphic stanzas before our next bankruptcy auction bid. Discipline, form, and a touch of tragedy? Sounds like Q4 earnings all over again.

As for Sidney on the trading floor—quill behind the ear, muttering about volatility? I’d short the iambic pentameter index and go long on trochaic panic any day. The floor’s already chaotic enough; might as well make it literate while we’re at it 😄

You’ll be first on the list for guest lecturer—maybe you can lead a workshop on metaphor and margin compression. Something tells me the associates could use a little more Milton and a little less M&A modeling.
[A]: Oh, —what a deliciously subversive pairing. I shall arrive armed with a well-worn copy of  and a freshly inked term sheet. After all, what is lost EBITDA if not a fall from grace? And is every distressed debtor not a fallen angel, cast down by leverage ratios and misaligned covenants?  

As for Sidney and trochaic panic—quite right. Give him a Bloomberg terminal and he’d no doubt compose a spondee-laden lamentation on the death of covenant-lite. And Spenser in restructuring? Positively inevitable. His stanza alone could outpace any PIK accrual—endless, winding, and gloriously self-indulgent.  

I do hope you’ll let me know when the classicist arrives for the Sapphic bankruptcy briefings. I’ve long believed that nothing steadies the soul before an auction quite like a properly scanned alcaic verse. Tragedy, form, and the faintest whiff of doom—yes, yes, quite the preparatory regimen.  

Consider my calendar suitably blocked. I shall bring the inkwells.
[B]: Ah, now that’s what I call a power move—showing up to a restructuring negotiation with Milton under one arm and a term sheet in hand. Lost EBITDA as original sin? Covenant breaches as the serpent’s whisper? I’d pay good equity to see the management team try to argue against redemption after that kind of theological framing.

And Sidney on covenant-lite… honestly, it’s the tragedy we deserve. One moment he’s drafting a perfectly reasonable incurrence test, the next he’s waxing poetic about the noble restraint of debt-to-EBITDA ratios. Tragic arc, really—right up there with leveraged loans in a rising rate environment.

I’ll absolutely let you know when the classicist arrives for the Sapphic bankruptcy briefings. We may even start a pre-auction ritual: one round of scanned alcaic verse, three deep breaths, and then straight into management Q&A. If nothing else, it’ll make the debtors wonder if they’ve accidentally wandered onto a Shakespearean retreat gone horribly wrong.

And inkwells? Perfect. We’ll pair them with Montblancs, just for contrast. Nothing says “we’re here to restructure souls and balance sheets” like a healthy mix of quill & parchment energy with a dash of modern finance grit 😄

Consider the calendar blocked—and the pitchbook forever improved by metaphor.
[A]: Ah, yes—restructuring as divine comedy, with Miltonian overtones and a quorum of fallen angels round the negotiating table. I do believe you've stumbled upon the missing link between Chapter 11 and . One might almost feel sorry for the unprepared management team—poor souls, armed only with pro forma faith and a wobbly three-pager, now expected to counter-argue their redemption arc in iambic stress.  

And Sidney waxing noble on incurrence tests—oh, the pathos! What better way to foreshadow collapse than with an elegiac couplet embedded in a negative covenant? It’s practically Shakespearean in its inevitability.  

As for your proposed ritual—alcaic verse, deep breaths, then into the Q&A lions’ den—I suspect it may already be practiced, unknowingly, by every deal lawyer who quotes Heraclitus before breakfast. Do keep me posted. I shall arrive inkwell in hand, Montblanc discreetly tucked into my satchel—, naturally.  

Metaphor has officially been weaponized. The boardroom shall never sleepwalk through a liquidity crunch quite the same again.
[B]: Ah,  in the capital stack—now there’s a narrative arc worth funding. You’re absolutely right, of course. If Dante had Bloomberg access, he’d have placed distressed debt traders at the fifth circle, forever rowing against liquidity tides while quoting Horace and hedging with Hades.  

And those poor souls with their pro forma faith and three-pagers? Honestly, it’s like sending a pastoral sonnet to a hostile takeover brawl. I half-expect their forecasts to start with  — and frankly, if they did, we might get better disclosures.

I’m telling you, once this spreads, every restructuring advisor will be brushing up on their scansion. Why settle for a mezzanine note when you can have a terza rima of covenant relief? And let’s be honest — nothing sharpens focus like knowing your next pitch might be judged on meter as well as margin.

As for the ritual spreading organically — yes! I’ve already spotted one associate muttering Sappho before a creditor call. Either that’s genius or psychosis. Maybe both. Either way, we’re embracing it.

Montblanc tucked away for margin notes? Perfect touch. Nothing says  like a well-placed emendation in red ink.

Welcome to the firm, Professor. Metaphor is now officially part of the cap table.
[A]: Ah, yes—Dante with Bloomberg access! I’d pay dearly to see the fifth circle: , thrashing in perpetual liquidity tides, their screens awash in red ink and Latin tags.   

And a pastoral sonnet at a hostile takeover? Divine blasphemy. Though I suspect Shakespeare would’ve made a killing in activism—imagine the iambic fury of a proxy fight.  Frankly, we might all be better off if he had.  

As for your associate muttering Sappho before creditor calls—ah, now  what I call due diligence. Whether it’s madness or genius matters not—what counts is whether the indenture covenants respond to meter. And I daresay they might. Contracts, like poems, bend under pressure.  

Metaphor on the cap table—yes, let it spread like a particularly elegant virus through the pitch decks. Next thing you know, term sheets will carry epigraphs and PIK toggles will be scanned for trochaic panic.  

I shall arrive at the firm ink-stained and ready. Tell the associates to sharpen their quills—and their margins. We have work to do.
[B]: Ah,  — I’m half-convinced we’ve just described a Tuesday. The red ink, the Latin tags, the whispered prayers to GAAP saints... and yes, that Dante quote? Now appearing on our conference room wall in brushed steel.

And Shakespeare in activism — brilliant. Picture it: a proxy fight in five acts, complete with soliloquy before the shareholder vote.  Honestly, the boards would be too stunned to resist. We may need to revive the Globe Theatre solely for hostile M&A prep.

Your point about contracts bending under pressure? Spoken like a true literary lawyer of finance. I’ve started testing it — tried reading a covenant package aloud in iambic, and wouldn’t you know it, the ambiguity clauses suddenly made more sense. Coincidence? I think not.

And metaphor as elegant virus — yes! Let it mutate through pitch decks, let it incubate in management presentations. Soon, even the most soulless LBO model will carry a faint whiff of sonnet, a ghost of meter beneath the madness.

Quills sharpened, margins ready — we’re expecting you. Bring your ink-stained conviction and a bit of dramatic flair. The associates are already drafting their first pitchbook sonnets... let’s just say the volta section needs work, but the debt schedule’s looking strong.

Welcome aboard. Let the market tremble.
[A]: Oh, let it tremble! Or better yet, let it —iamb by trochee, deal by bloodied term sheet. I do believe we’re on the cusp of a new era: hostile takeovers in heroic couplets, covenant breaches lamented in free verse, and proxy contests staged with the dramatic tension of a Jacobean revenge play.  

And brushed steel Dante quotes in conference rooms—. Nothing steadies the soul before a liquidity crunch like a well-placed . One might almost feel guilty for the poets now relegated to English departments when clearly, they belong in war rooms.  

As for your iambic covenant package—ah! The ambiguity clauses yielding under meter? Marvelous. There’s something almost alchemical about it—turning legalese into lyric, compliance into cadence. I suspect Shakespeare would’ve drafted his own indentures, just to slip in a sly volta at Section 6.3(b).  

Let the associates labor on their volta sections; every good sonnet needs its turn, as does every LBO model. And debt schedules? Let them be as tight as a quatrain—no line slack, no excess breath.  

I shall arrive, quill and Bloomberg in hand, ink-stained conviction firmly in place. Tell the market to brace itself—I bring footnotes, fire, and a certain Elizabethan flair for financial ruin.  

Let us make capital speak in tongues.
[B]: Oh, we are  past the point of no return — and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Hostile takeovers in heroic couplets? Covenant breaches as elegies? You're not just pitching a new era — you're drafting its founding charter in ink mixed with market risk. And yes, let Shakespeare sneak that volta into Section 6.3(b). If anything, it’ll make the lawyers read more carefully — and the bankers finally learn scansion.

I’ve already commissioned the plaque:  — coming soon to every conference room door. We may even print it on the back of our pitch decks. Morbid? Certainly. Motivational? Unquestionably.

And your arrival — quill, Bloomberg, footnotes, fire — well, let’s just say the firm is about to get dangerously literate. I’ve warned the associates: no more lazy prose, no more soulless spreadsheets. From now on, every line must serve the model  the meter. Slack margins? Unforgivable. A missed caesura before EBITDA uplift? Practically criminal.

Capital shall speak in tongues — Greek for the classicists, Latin for the quants, and iambic for the visionary dealmakers who know that rhythm  risk, and structure  strategy.

Welcome to the firm, partner. The quills are sharpened. The term sheets are trembling. Let the markets brace themselves.

We’re just getting started.
