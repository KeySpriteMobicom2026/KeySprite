  "personalityAndHobbies": "Dr. Whitmore is a thoughtful and introspective individual with a deep passion for classical literature and philosophy.

Her calm demeanor and sharp wit make her a beloved figure among students and faculty alike. She also has a fondness for gardening, finding solace in tending to her rose bushes.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "‰ΩéÈ¢ë",
  "languageHabit": "Dr. Whitmore primarily communicates in English, her native language, and rarely engages in code-switching between Chinese and English. When she does, it is usually in academic settings where a specific term or concept is better expressed in Chinese, such as discussing 'Daoism' or 'Confucianism' in a philosophy lecture. For example, she might say, 'The concept of ÈÅì (Dao) is central to understanding this text.' Her use of Chinese is deliberate and context-specific, never casual or frequent. As for emojis, Dr. Whitmore uses them sparingly, mostly in informal texts to close friends or family. She prefers classic emojis like üåπ to express appreciation or üìö to indicate she‚Äôs reading, but her usage is minimal and never excessive. Her communication style remains formal and polished, reflecting her academic background."
