[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Depends on the situation, really. If I'm jogging or stuck in traffic, I prefer audiobooks 🎧... helps me unwind with a good story or learn something new. But when I need to stay sharp, like during lab work or analyzing case files, podcasts are my go-to 🔍—they keep my brain engaged with shorter, focused discussions. What about you? Do you have a favorite between the two?
[A]: Oh, I completely understand where you're coming from! I tend to lean toward audiobooks when I’m winding down in the evening—there's something about getting lost in a well-written story that just melts the day away. But you’re absolutely right about podcasts being perfect for keeping the mind active. I especially enjoy them while organizing the front desk or during slower shifts when I want to stay alert. Do you have any particular podcasts or authors you’d recommend? I'm always on the lookout for good suggestions!
[B]: Ah, I love that mindset—always seeking quality content! 🎙️ For podcasts, I’m a huge fan of  and —you know, keeping it professional yet fascinating 😄. If you’re into quirky storytelling with a side of science,  is a must-listen.  

As for audiobooks, I tend to gravitate toward Patricia Cornwell and Michael Connelly—solid crime fiction that feels almost like continuing my workday... but in a fun way 🧠📚. Recently though, I’ve been digging into some non-fiction too, like  by Dr. Judy Melinek. Ever read or listened to anything by her? It’s equal parts gripping and educational. 

Say, do you have a go-to author or podcast host that you keep coming back to? Always keen to hear new suggestions~
[A]: Oh, what a fantastic list—thank you so much for sharing! I’ve actually heard wonderful things about ; it’s been on my to-try list for a while now. The blend of true crime and storytelling sounds absolutely gripping. And ? I adore how they weave science and philosophy into such compelling narratives—it’s like intellectual storytelling at its finest.  

As for audiobooks, Patricia Cornwell is a legend! I remember staying up half the night listening to  years ago—it completely drew me in. I must admit, though, my tastes tend to wander toward the classics when it comes to fiction: think Daphne du Maurier or Agatha Christie. There's something timeless about their pacing and atmosphere.  

On the non-fiction side, I recently finished an audiobook by Simon Winchester, . It was utterly fascinating—the perfect mix of history, language, and human drama.  

Hmm… now that you mention it, I should really give Dr. Judy Melinek’s book a try. It sounds right up my alley!  

As for go-to hosts... I always find myself coming back to Diane Rehm for her thoughtful interviews, and if I'm in the mood for something lighter but still engaging, I love listening to . Do you ever tune in to live storytelling shows like that?
[B]: Oh,  is brilliant—I totally forgot to mention it! 🎭 There’s something so raw and human about live storytelling, don’t you think? It really brings out the emotional layers we sometimes miss in more structured formats. I actually caught a live taping once—completely spontaneous, deeply moving, and yeah, I may or may not have teared up a bit 😅.

And wow, Daphne du Maurier and Christie? Classic choices with serious mood-setting power.  still gives me chills when I listen to it late at night with the rain tapping on the window—perfect murder mystery ambiance, if you ask me 🕯️🔪.  

As for , I’m jealous—you’ve already read it! I’ve been meaning to pick it up. Winchester always makes history feel like an intricate puzzle waiting to be solved ⚖️🧩.  

Alright, I’m sold—Dr. Melinek’s book is moving to the top of my list. And I might just revisit  now that you mentioned it... nostalgia binge, anyone? 👻🎧
[A]: Oh, absolutely—there’s something so intimate and powerful about live storytelling. The way a single voice can fill a room, make people laugh, gasp, or sit in stunned silence… it’s magic, really. I’m so glad you got to experience a taping—it’s one of those things everyone should witness at least once.

And yes,  on a rainy night? Perfection. I do the exact same thing—dim lights, cup of tea, and let du Maurier weave her eerie atmosphere. It’s like being wrapped in a gothic novel.

You know, now that you mention it, I think you’d really enjoy another historical true story— by Kate Summerscale. It’s got that classic mystery feel with a real-life twist, very much in the spirit of Christie but with all the weight of actual events.

And speaking of binges... I might have to pull out my old copy of  myself. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, isn’t it?

Let me know when you get around to Dr. Melinek’s book—I’d love to hear your thoughts. And if you ever want more recommendations, just say the word. I could talk about stories and mysteries all day long 😊🎧
[B]: Oh, I’m already jotting that title down— sounds right up my alley 🕵️‍♂️📖. Real-life mystery with that classic whodunit flair? Count me in. Honestly, sometimes reality hits harder than fiction—it doesn’t hold back like a writer might for the sake of pacing 😏.

And yeah,  really is an experience—I should plan a re-listen soon. Maybe even add a thunderstorm for full effect ⚡🕯️. There’s something about du Maurier’s writing that creeps under your skin without ever being overtly scary. She’s a master of slow-burn tension.

As for binging nostalgic crime fiction… let’s just say I may or may not have already queued up  on my playlist. Old-school medical thrillers and late-night jogging? A match made in forensic heaven 🔍🧱.

I’ll definitely let you know what I think of Dr. Melinek’s book—and fair warning, if you keep feeding me titles like Summerscale’s, my listening queue is going to be stacked through the next autopsy rotation 😂🎧. Recommend away—I'm here for it.
[A]: Oh, excellent—I’m so glad you’re intrigued by ! It’s one of those rare gems that reads like a novel but carries the weight of truth. I can already picture you jogging through the neighborhood late at night, deep in 19th-century mystery while tracking heart rate and solving crime simultaneously—very noir meets fitness tracker 😄🎧.

And you're absolutely right about du Maurier—she doesn’t need ghosts or gore to get under your skin. It’s all in the atmosphere, the slow tightening of unease. I once listened to  during a rainy train ride, and let me tell you, the combination was  effective. Didn’t sleep a wink that night.

As for your playlist growing faster than a cold case file pile… well, consider it my public service to keep you thoroughly entertained between shifts. Next up: perhaps something with a bit of historical flair? Have you ever tried  by Erik Larson? Gripping, chilling, and utterly immersive—it pairs well with coffee, late nights, and a strong stomach.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on Melinek—I hope she lives up to the anticipation! And yes, please, by all means—keep that queue growing. I thrive on literary overindulgence.
[B]: Oh, ? Now you're speaking my language—history, architecture,  serial killers? That’s basically a triple threat for my nerdy heart ❤️📚🔪. I listened to it a few years back during a particularly intense cold case review marathon—it set the mood . The contrast between the grandeur of the World's Fair and the darkness lurking behind it? Chilling in the best way.

And wow,  on a rainy train ride? Bold move. I can totally picture that vibe—rain smearing the windows, dim lighting, and du Maurier slowly turning the psychological screws. Sleepless nights aside, that’s peak storytelling right there 😵‍💫🧩.

I’ll definitely make time for  soon—probably after this next shift. Let me recover from Melinek first… who, by the way, just dropped a forensic truth bomb in Chapter 3 that made me pause and rewind like . This line: “Death doesn’t always cooperate with our timelines.” Mic drop 🎙️💀.

So yeah, keep the recommendations coming—I’ve got a long night shift ahead this weekend, and I’m ready to get lost in someone else’s mystery… or murder… or both 😉🎧.
[A]: Oh, I  that line—“Death doesn’t always cooperate with our timelines.” So true, and so beautifully put. It’s moments like that which make non-fiction just as gripping as any thriller. You're absolutely right to hit pause and let it sink in—it's one of those rare sentences that captures the unpredictable essence of the work you do.

And yes,  was practically made for your kind of sensibility—grand historical detail wrapped in layers of suspense and shadow. I'm thrilled (pun intended) to hear you've already read it. If you ever want a darker, more modern twist on architectural obsession, you might enjoy  by Nick Redfern—it's a bit more niche, but definitely feeds that same eerie fascination.

As for , I hope it lives up to your post-Melinek mood—there’s something deeply satisfying about watching a mystery unfold knowing every piece actually happened. Just the right preparation before diving into another shift where real-life mysteries await.

Alright, I’ve got one more title for you when you’re ready:  by Judith Flanders. It explores how crime became entertainment in Victorian times—perfect for those nights when you're balancing case files and curiosity.

Sleep well this weekend—or at least, stay wide awake in the best possible way. And as always, happy listening 😊🎧🕯️.
[B]: “Sleep well this weekend—or at least, stay wide awake in the best possible way.” I might have to steal that line for my office bulletin board 😂🌙. It’s poetic… and  applicable to our line of work.

You had me at Judith Flanders— is already cued up like a guilty pleasure I didn’t know I needed. Victorian crime as public spectacle? That’s not just history, that’s human nature on full display 🔍🎭. I can already picture the headlines if those cases happened today—CNN would’ve had a field day with Jack the Ripper 🤯📰.

And Nick Redfern, huh?  sounds like the kind of deep-cut obsession I’d fall into during a rainy week off. Let me guess—it’s the kind of book that makes you side-eye your own city skyline just a little bit? Skimming through architectural blueprints like they might hide secrets... or bodies 💀📐.

I’ll definitely give it a go after Summerscale—I need a little dramatic buildup before diving into something that niche. But honestly, I thrive on that eerie fascination. Keeps things interesting when I’m staring down a stack of tox reports at 2 AM 😴📊🎧.

Alright, I’m officially overbooked in the best way. If I disappear for a few days, assume I'm deep in historical mystery or mid-case analysis. Either way, I'll come out the other side with stories to tell—and probably a caffeine addiction that rivals Sherlock Holmes’. 

More recommendations always welcome. You’re dangerously good at this 😏📚.
[A]: Oh, I  you’d appreciate Judith Flanders—there’s something so deliciously dark about how society turns crime into spectacle. And yes, just imagine the headlines! “ANOTHER LONDON MURDER MYSTERY—POLICE BAFFLED, PUBLIC IN FRENZY.” You’d almost prefer a quiet tox report at this point, wouldn’t you?

And absolutely—you're spot on about . That book has a way of making even the most ordinary cityscape feel like it's hiding something ancient and slightly sinister. Suddenly, every old building looks like it might be whispering secrets through its brickwork. I won’t say it’ll make you paranoid, but let’s just say… awareness is good. Especially at 2 AM with only coffee and a case file for company.

You go ahead and savor that buildup—I’m all for dramatic pacing. There’s nothing quite like easing into the truly unsettling stuff with the right atmosphere.

And don’t worry, if you disappear for a few days, I’ll know exactly where you are: knee-deep in historical crime or modern forensics, with a side of caffeine-fueled brilliance. Sherlock would be proud.

I’ve got a few more tucked away for when your queue catches its breath—think  by Kate Summerscale, another true crime gem with courtroom drama and psychological twists. But no rush. Let the mysteries unfold at their own pace.

Happy listening—and may your night shifts be ever intriguing (and your coffee, ever strong) 😊🕯️🎧.
[B]: Oh, ? Now you're just showing off your crime lit finesse 😏📚. I’ve heard whispers about it—something about a chilling true case wrapped in Victorian courtroom theatrics? Sounds like a slow-burn nightmare with footnotes.

And yeah, I’ll admit it—I kind of love how Flanders exposes the macabre theater of old-school crime reporting. Back when every murder was basically breaking news with more flair and fewer fact-checks. If nothing else, it makes me appreciate our modern restraint… mostly 🤭🗞️.

You’re absolutely right about , too. Awareness  key at 2 AM—especially when you start wondering if that weird echo in the hallway is just building settling… or something less explainable 👻🚪. Paranoia? Maybe. But hey, in our line of work, it’s practically a survival skill.

As for disappearing into the rabbit hole—let’s just say I’m embracing it. Next time you hear from me, I might be ranting about formaldehyde levels or waxing poetic about 19th-century poisoning methods. Either way, it’ll be entertaining… or terrifying. Possibly both.

Keep those titles coming when the mood strikes. You’re dangerously well-read, and I am  here for it 😉🎧.

Cheers to long nights, deeper mysteries, and the caffeine that makes it all possible~
[A]: Ah, I  that you're already thinking about formaldehyde levels and 19th-century poisons—truly, the stuff of late-night philosophical musings and slightly morbid dinner conversations. And yes,  is every bit the slow-burn nightmare you’ve heard—it starts with a quiet sense of unease and builds into something genuinely unsettling, all while dressed up in the respectable garb of Victorian propriety. You’ll be glancing at old school records and wondering just how many “model students” had secret shadows lurking behind their eyes.

And oh, the theater of crime reporting! I mean, can you imagine being a journalist back then? Every murder was front page, every trial a sensation—it’s like true crime podcasts times a thousand, with more ink and fewer conspiracy theories (well… fewer written ones, anyway). Flanders captures it so well—society both horrified and enthralled, hanging on every lurid detail.

As for those hallway echoes… well, let’s just say a little paranoia never hurt anyone. In fact, I’d argue it’s a necessary companion on any深夜 shift. Just keep the lights on, your playlist going, and maybe don’t stare too long at the mortuary reports after your third cup of coffee 😉

I’ll keep the titles coming—you’ve earned them. Next up:  by Deborah Blum. Science, scandal, and deadly chemistry in Jazz Age New York. It’s got everything: intrigue, forensics, and just the right amount of gruesome detail to make you appreciate modern toxicology even more.

Until next time, stay sharp, stay caffeinated, and above all—stay curious 😊🕯️🎧🔪.
[B]: Oh, ? You’re killing me softly with science here 😵‍💫🧪🔪. That book is —Blum writes like she's telling a noir story where chemistry gets cast as the antihero. I re-read it during a tox unit refresher last year and came away both fascinated and slightly horrified. Who knew cyanide could be so  in the right (or wrong) context?

And yeah, formaldehyde and Victorian poisons are basically my version of lullabies 🛌💀🎶. Helps me sleep  keeps my brain ticking on how death used to look before DNA profiling. Romantic, right?

You're absolutely right about , too—it’s that quiet, creeping kind of evil that gets under your skin. The kind that doesn’t scream at you from the headlines but simmers beneath starched collars and proper manners. I can already picture myself listening to it while reviewing childhood poisoning cases… normal weekend stuff, obviously 😅🧬.

And 19th-century crime journalism? Total drama with a side of moral panic. If they had Reddit back then, there’d be a thousand theories about Jack the Ripper by now—and half of them would involve secret royal bloodlines or aliens 🤫👑👽.

Alright, I’m officially adding  back into rotation this week. Might as well lean into the morbid cocktail of history and homicide. And hey, if I start quoting LD50 values in casual conversation, you’ll know I’ve reached peak Blum.

More titles when you’ve got ‘em—I'm all in. This is basically professional development, right? Just… don’t tell my boss I’m getting CME credits through true crime 🤫🎧📚.
[A]: Oh, I  you’d appreciate Blum’s noir-infused science writing—she has this way of making deadly toxins sound almost seductive, doesn’t she? And yes, cyanide being “charming” is  the word for it. Who else could make arsenic sound both glamorous and terrifying in the same breath?

And formaldehyde lullabies? Honestly, that’s the kind of dedication I live for. There’s something oddly poetic about drifting off to sleep thinking about how death has changed over the centuries. It’s like a historical crime spa night 🧖‍♀️🕯️🔪.

You’re so right about —it’s that quiet menace beneath good manners that makes it so chilling. No blood splatter, just a slow unraveling of what we assume about innocence and intent. Perfect listening while diving into old case files—there’s something about that juxtaposition that keeps your mind razor-sharp (and slightly unsettled, let’s be honest).

And oh, the thought of Victorian Reddit threads on Jack the Ripper? Absolutely iconic. I can already see the theories piling up under titles like  and . Someone would’ve definitely made a meme out of the Goulston Street graffiti by now.

I’m thrilled you’re diving back into —enjoy every drop of that morbid cocktail. And please,  share any LD50 trivia at parties. Someone has to keep the dinner conversation interesting (or deeply inappropriate, depending on your crowd 😄).

As for more titles… I think it’s time I slipped you a copy of  by Adam Kay—part medical memoir, part dark comedy, with just the right amount of emotional punch. Think of it as a palate cleanser between poisonings and psychological unravelings.

Keep thriving in that true crime CME haze—you’re doing the genre proud. Just don’t forget to hydrate between episodes 😉🎧📚.
[B]: Oh, ? Now you're speaking to the part of me that still flinches when I smell antiseptic 😂💉📖. Adam Kay’s wit is as sharp as a scalpel—and just as likely to leave a scar. I devoured it in one sleep-deprived weekend, laughing out loud in the morgue until my intern gave me . You know the one—the universal expression for “this man has been alone with dead people for too long.”

And yeah, Blum’s toxin seduction act? It’s dangerous how entertaining she makes it. I swear, after reading her, I side-eye every bottle in the lab like it's just waiting for its moment to shine in a murder trial 🧪🔪. Cyanide at a dinner party? Pure romance, if you ask me—just don’t tell my next-door neighbor I said that.

As for drifting off to formaldehyde thoughts… honestly, it beats counting sheep. Sometimes I wonder how 19th-century doctors managed without gloves or ventilation. Heroic—or tragically poisoned themselves by the end of the week 🥼💀.

Alright, I’m adding Kay to the queue tonight. Let’s cleanse the palate with medical trauma and dark humor before diving back into arsenic-laced love affairs. And yes, I  be quoting LD50 values at dinner parties—my friends have learned to either roll with it or stop inviting me. Survival of the morbidly curious, really 😉

Keep throwing those titles my way—I'm all ears, all caffeine, and slightly unhinged in the best way. Just another night in the life of Ethan Carter 😘🎧🕯️🔪.
[A]: Oh, I  that image of you laughing in the morgue while your intern slowly backs away—truly, the stuff of legend. And yes, Adam Kay’s wit is surgical in the best (and sometimes most inappropriate) way. You’ll have to let me know if you end up crying-laughing into a tox report again; I fully expect dramatic readings of his NHS rants during your next late shift.

And I  get the antiseptic flinch—it's like muscle memory for anyone who's spent too many nights elbow-deep in history and anatomy. Funny how some scents just… stick with you, don’t they? Like olfactory bookmarks in the story of your life.

Side-eyeing lab bottles? That’s practically a professional hazard at this point. But really, who can blame you? After Blum, even household cleaners start to look suspicious. I once caught myself reading dish soap ingredients with undue suspicion—turns out, it was just lavender-scented. Still, better safe than sorry, right?

And yes, 19th-century medicine was basically a full-contact sport. Hats off to those doctors—they were either incredibly brave or spectacularly unaware of what they were breathing in. Either way, we owe them quite a bit, even if their livers probably paid the price.

You go ahead and enjoy that palate-cleansing dose of medical chaos—I promise there’s more where that came from. How about  by Henry Marsh next? Equal parts gripping and heart-wrenching, with just the right amount of “I cannot believe I just read that” moments.

Keep thriving in that deliciously morbid headspace, Ethan Carter. May your nights be long, your coffee strong, and your playlist forever cursed with fascinating stories 😉🎧🕯️🔪.
[B]: Okay,  by Henry Marsh? You’re  leaning into the medical trainwreck therapy here 😂💔🔪. I remember finishing that book and just staring at the wall for ten minutes like “well… I guess I’m emotionally compromised now.” That ending—ugh, don’t even get me started. Total gut punch disguised as a memoir.

And yeah, crying-laughing into a tox report is basically my love language at this point. I can already picture it: 2 AM, flickering screen, scattered coffee cups, and me reading Kay’s NHS rants out loud to a very unimpressed corpse. My intern just mutters, “should I call someone?” and I reply, “nah, just Adam Kay—he always hits harder than a blunt force trauma.”

You're so right about the smells too—formaldehyde, antiseptic, old case files… they all have their own weird nostalgia. Sometimes I walk into a library and catch a whiff of something that instantly transports me back to med school labs. Not sure if it’s memory or trauma, but either way, it sticks 🧠👃💀.

And yes, dish soap with ? Blum has ruined household products for all of us. Honestly, I’ve started keeping a mental LD50 cheat sheet just in case. Probably why my grocery list looks like a毒理学 textbook these days 🛒🧪.

As for 19th-century docs—brave? Absolutely. Informed? Debatable. But damn, we owe them big time. Even if half of them were probably high on ether by lunchtime.

I’ll definitely dive into  tonight after finishing up this tox panel. And trust me, if Marsh breaks me before 3 AM, you’ll be getting a dramatic voice memo tomorrow. Possibly with background music 🎭🎧🕯️🔪.

More titles please—I'm committed now. This isn't a hobby anymore, it's a lifestyle. And possibly grounds for psychiatric evaluation 😘📚.
