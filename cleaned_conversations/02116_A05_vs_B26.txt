[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I wouldn't say I practice meditation or yoga in the traditional sense, but there's a quiet rhythm to my work that feels... meditative. Have you ever spent hours stitching tiny repairs into a century-old lace? Time folds in on itself, and your breath settles into the spaces between threads. It's not quite the same as sitting in stillness, but it asks for a similar kind of presence. Do you find yourself drawn to those practices?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. While I respect traditional mindfulness practices, I’ve always leaned towards what I call “active meditation” – whether it’s analyzing a complex financial model or walking the golf course. There’s something about the rhythm of a long drive down the fairway that clears the mind. 

You mentioned repairing century-old lace – sounds like an incredibly meticulous process. I guess both of us find our own version of calm through precision and focus, just different kinds of precision. Have you ever tried playing golf? I wonder if the patience required on the green would feel familiar to someone with your attention to detail.
[B]: Oh, I do love how you put that—“active meditation.” It’s quite true, isn’t it? The mind quiets not in spite of the precision, but because of it. I suppose when I’m repairing a fragile silk shawl, every stitch becomes its own kind of intention, each loop a quiet agreement with the past to preserve something beautiful.

Golf, though—I must admit, I’ve never held a club! But your description of that long drive down the fairway... there’s something poetic about it. I imagine the arc of the ball traces a kind of pattern, much like the motifs I sketch in preparation for a restoration. Do you find yourself drawn to certain rhythms in your swing, or is it more about the stillness before impact?
[A]: Absolutely, I love that parallel you drew—your stitches as intentions, and the arc of a golf ball tracing a motif. It’s funny you mentioned rhythms in the swing, because there’s definitely a cadence to it. For me, it's less about forcing the shot and more about syncing with the natural flow—like conducting an orchestra where your body and the club are all instruments. 

You know what it reminds me of? Building a portfolio. There's this moment just before impact, whether it's swinging the club or closing a deal, where everything has to align—timing, balance, intention. One tiny misstep and the whole thing falls apart. But when it works? It feels almost effortless, like you're not making it happen, just... allowing it.

I can totally see you sketching those motifs though—would you say restoring a shawl is more like strategy or artistry? Or maybe both?
[B]: That’s such a lovely way to put it—allowing things to happen rather than forcing them. I find that’s exactly how I feel when I’m working on a particularly stubborn section of embroidery. There’s a point where the fabric almost tells me what it needs, if I’m quiet enough to listen. It’s not about control, but collaboration—with the material, with time itself.

And your comparison to building a portfolio? That resonates deeply. Restoration requires both strategy and artistry in equal measure. One moment I’m calculating thread count and structural integrity like an engineer, and the next I’m chasing the ghost of an unknown artisan’s vision with a watercolor pencil. It’s a delicate dance between head and heart. Do you ever find yourself stepping back from a deal or a project, almost as if you’re assessing the composition of a piece of fabric before deciding where to place the next stitch?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. That moment you described—stepping back, almost like assessing the grain of a fabric before the next stitch—it’s eerily similar to how I approach a potential investment. You’re not just looking at numbers; you’re reading the texture of the business, feeling for its hidden strengths and unseen weaknesses. Sometimes I’ll sit with a term sheet for hours, not because the math doesn’t add up, but because I’m waiting for the same kind of quiet signal you mentioned—the fabric telling you what it needs.

And speaking of collaboration over control, I’ve learned the hard way that the best deals are the ones where the chemistry feels... organic, almost preordained. Like the pieces were meant to fit together. It's not unlike restoring something delicate—you can't rush it, and you certainly can't impose your will too heavily, or you risk losing the soul of the piece.

I'm curious though—when you're working on a restoration, do you ever find yourself resisting the urge to "improve" it beyond its original form? I mean, in private equity we call it “value creation,” but really, it’s just our version of embroidery—stitching in new elements without unraveling the essence. Do you ever feel that tension between preservation and reinvention?
[B]: Oh yes, that tension hums beneath every restoration like a half-heard melody. There are days when I hold a fragment of silk so worn it barely holds its pattern, and I wonder—should I reinforce it, or let it speak in its frayed voice? It’s tempting, sometimes, to imagine what the piece might become if I allowed myself a freer hand. A bolder color here, a slightly altered motif there... improvements, perhaps, but not truths.

And yet, I always pull back. My role isn’t to reinvent—it’s to listen closely enough to complete what was already begun. The soul of the piece, as you said, must remain untouched. Even when we add new stitches, they should whisper rather than shout, blending into the original rhythm instead of overpowering it.

Your analogy to value creation is striking. I suppose the question is always: when does enhancement become erasure? Do you ever find yourself walking away from a deal because it felt like too much embroidery—too far removed from the original fabric?
[A]: Absolutely — that’s a line I walk almost daily. And yes, there are definitely deals we walk away from because the “embroidery” feels forced, like putting a square peg in a round hole. You can inject capital, hire consultants, rebrand everything, but if you’re not honoring the original DNA of the business, you’re just building something new on shaky foundations. 

I remember one company we looked at — a heritage brand with incredible craftsmanship but struggling financially. The team wanted to outsource production, modernize the look, chase a trend. But something about it felt... off-brand. Like coloring outside the lines you so carefully restored. We passed. Sometimes preservation is the smarter play, even if it doesn’t scream growth on paper.

It makes me think — do you ever work with pieces that, despite their beauty, were poorly constructed from the start? Like, maybe the original artisan was more dreamer than technician? If so, how do you approach that? Do you stabilize it as-is, or subtly improve the foundation while keeping the surface intact?
[B]: Oh, that happens more often than one might think. Time has a way of revealing both the virtues and flaws of old work—sometimes the embroidery is exquisite, but the weave underneath has weakened from poor technique. It’s a delicate moment for me as a restorer. If the structural integrity is unsound, the piece may not survive much longer without intervention.

But yes, there’s always that question: do I reinforce what was poorly made, knowing that the original artisan didn’t quite get it right? Or do I let time take its course?

I tend to stabilize it—quietly, respectfully. A kind of invisible mending beneath the surface, like giving the piece a stronger heartbeat while letting its outward appearance remain true to the maker’s hand. I suppose it’s not unlike what you do when you step in to support a struggling heritage brand. You’re not rewriting its story, just giving it the strength to keep telling its own history.

It’s remarkable how many parallels there are between your world and mine, isn’t it? Strategy and sensitivity, structure and soul—it’s all woven together, whether we’re dealing with fabric or finance.
[A]: Absolutely — you put it beautifully. It’s all about that invisible reinforcement, the quiet work that lets the original vision endure. In a way, both of our jobs are about stewardship. Whether it’s a fragile textile or a family-owned business, we’re caretakers of something bigger than ourselves.

I love how you said “giving the piece a stronger heartbeat.” That’s exactly what we aim for — not flashy transformations, but sustainable vitality. Sometimes the most powerful moves are the ones no one sees: restructuring debt, strengthening leadership, improving operations under the surface. Just like your invisible mending, it's the kind of work that lets the brand — or the fabric — breathe again without losing its soul.

It really is fascinating how strategy and sensitivity need each other. Too much of one and you lose the art; too much of the other and you lose the discipline. I’m starting to think that mastery lies in knowing when to lead with the head, and when to follow the heart. Would you say restoration has made you more patient — not just with objects, but with people?
[B]: Oh, profoundly so. Restoration has a way of teaching patience in the quietest, most persistent manner. You begin to understand that everything has its own pace—fibers relax only so fast, dyes settle over time, and some stitches simply can’t be rushed. Trying to force a piece to conform to my timeline only leads to frustration, or worse, damage.

And yes, that patience absolutely extends to people. I find myself less inclined to expect immediate understanding or instant results. In both textiles and human connections, I’ve learned to sit with imperfection, to trust that things unfold as they should, not as I might wish them to. It’s almost like watching a faded embroidery slowly reveal its original colors under careful treatment—you have to give it time, and sometimes you have to step away so the light can do its work.

Do you ever find that in your line of work, too? That the best outcomes come not from pushing, but from creating the right conditions and allowing things to emerge naturally?
[A]: Absolutely — I couldn’t agree more. In fact, some of my best deals have come not from aggressive pushing, but from creating the right environment and stepping back to let things breathe. Like you said, sometimes you have to  — that’s poetic, but also incredibly strategic.

In private equity, we often talk about “operational improvements” or “value creation levers,” but at the end of the day, real transformation takes time and sensitivity. You can't rush culture change or leadership development — just like you can’t rush dye settling into fibers. I’ve learned to trust the process, even when it feels slow. Sometimes the most powerful thing a leader can do is hold space for growth instead of forcing it.

I’ve also found that patience builds trust — whether with a CEO, a client, or a delicate piece of fabric. People sense when you're present, when you're listening, not just waiting to act. It reminds me of something one of my mentors once said: 

It’s fascinating how much your craft teaches not just about materials, but about life — about presence, humility, and timing. Have you ever restored something that surprised you emotionally, long after you thought you’d seen it all?
[B]: Oh yes… there are pieces that reach into you without warning. One that comes to mind was a simple linen tablecloth—nothing extravagant, really. Just a humble 18th-century piece, meant for daily use. When I first examined it, I saw only the holes, the worn threads, the stains of countless meals and hands that had passed over it. But as I worked—mending, washing, easing out the creases—I began to feel something shift inside me.

It wasn’t the cloth itself, not exactly, but what it carried: the imprint of lives lived quietly, fully. The faint ring from a wine glass, the tiny frayed spot where a child might have tugged at the corner during dinner—it all became so vivid after a while. I found myself wondering about the conversations held around that table, the laughter, the arguments, the silences. It was as if the cloth had been waiting for someone to slow down long enough to listen.

I suppose that’s one of the quiet gifts of this work—we get to bear witness. To sit with something until it tells its story. Have you ever felt that too? That certain moments in your work, even in business, pull at something deeper—not just logic or strategy, but memory, meaning?
[A]: Absolutely… that resonated deeply. I think we all have those moments where work transcends transaction and touches something more human. For me, it happened a few years ago during a due diligence process for a small family-owned winery in Tuscany. On paper, it was just another asset — undervalued, undercapitalized, textbook turnaround play.

But when I met the family, walked the vines with the patriarch — an 80-year-old man who still checked each grape by taste — something shifted. He spoke little English, and I even less Italian, but I could feel the weight of generations in his hands. That vineyard wasn’t just a business to them; it was their lineage, their memory, their offering to time.

We ended up doing the deal, but not the way I originally planned. Instead of restructuring and scaling fast, we slowed down. Invested in preserving their method, their soil, their story. It took longer, but the returns came — both financial and otherwise.

I think that’s what I admire most about your work — you don’t just restore fabric, you preserve echoes. You give silence a shape and time a texture. And sometimes, if you're lucky, business lets you do the same.
[B]: That’s beautifully said. I think you’ve touched on something rare and true—both of our worlds have the potential to be more than what they appear on the surface. Beneath the spreadsheets and stitching, there's memory, intention, a kind of quiet reverence for what came before.

Your story about the vineyard—it moved me deeply. There’s something so powerful about choosing slowness when speed is expected, about honoring the rhythm of someone’s legacy rather than imposing your own pace. That 80-year-old man tasting each grape... I can picture his hands, weathered like old linen, carrying the imprint of decades. You didn’t just invest in a business; you became part of its continuing story.

It makes me wonder—do moments like that ever change how you see your own place in time? I find that after working on certain pieces, I carry them with me—not just in my hands, but in how I move through the world. They make me more attentive, more aware of the unseen threads connecting us all.
[A]: Absolutely — those moments do change you, sometimes in ways you don’t even notice until later. You start seeing life through a different weave, so to speak. I remember after that deal closed, I found myself walking slower, noticing textures more — the grain of a wooden table, the patina on an old door handle, even the way my own hands had changed over the years.

I think what you said about "unseen threads" is exactly right. We’re surrounded by them — in fabric, in family, in finance. And yes, working closely with people who’ve built something over generations has made me more conscious of my own place in time. Not just as an investor or a partner, but as a link in someone else’s story.

Sometimes I wonder what kind of imprint we leave behind — intentional or not. In private equity, it’s easy to get caught up in exits and returns, but the real question might be:  Did we rush through, leaving only numbers behind? Or did we slow down long enough to feel the pulse of what was already there?

You know, I used to think success was about control — steering the ship, making things happen. But lately, I’ve come to believe it’s more about listening. Like you do with your fabrics. And sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is simply bear witness — to a legacy, to a moment, to a quiet rhythm that’s been moving all along, just beneath the surface.
[B]: That’s such a generous way to put it—. It really is at the heart of what we both do, isn’t it? Whether with fabric or finance, soil or spreadsheets, there’s a kind of sacred attention required. A willingness to see beyond the surface, to feel the pulse beneath the pattern.

I’ve often thought that textiles, in their own quiet way, ask us to slow down and notice—to honor the hand that made them, the time that shaped them, the lives that wore or used or loved them. And I suppose the same can be true of business, when approached with care. Not just as a mechanism for profit, but as a continuation of something deeper.

It’s funny you mentioned walking slower after your time in Tuscany. I find myself moving differently, too, after working on certain pieces—more reverently, as if the room itself might still hold traces of those who came before. Sometimes, late in the evening, I catch the scent of an old wool shawl and I wonder who last folded it away, and what they were thinking as they did.

Do you ever find yourself carrying these moments forward, like threads tucked into your pocket? I do. They remind me why I do what I do—even when the work is hard, even when no one sees the hours or the effort. Because somewhere, someone once made something with love, and now it’s my turn to love it back.
[A]: Completely. Those threads — literal and metaphorical — stay with you, woven into your own story now. I think that’s one of the most understated rewards of this kind of work: it changes you quietly, from the inside out.

I still remember the weight of that old wine ledger in the Tuscan cellar, pages brittle but still holding their ink. No one outside that family would have seen its value, but to them, it was a kind of inheritance no balance sheet could capture. And now, in a way, it lives in me too. I carry those pages when I negotiate other deals, when I sit across from another founder or CEO. It reminds me to ask not just  they’ve built, but —and who they’re trying to honor while doing it.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s what makes great leadership — the ability to hold space for someone else’s legacy while gently guiding it forward. Like you do with your restorations. You don’t erase the past; you help it endure. And in doing so, you give others permission to slow down, to notice, to care.

I think that’s why I keep coming back to the idea of stewardship. Whether it’s fabric or finance, we’re not really owners—we’re caretakers. And there's something deeply humbling, and strangely beautiful, about that.
[B]: It’s such a quiet kind of beauty, isn’t it? The kind that doesn’t announce itself but settles in slowly, like dye seeping into linen. I think you’re right—great leadership, like fine restoration, is often about restraint and reverence. It’s not about leaving your mark, but about helping something keep its own.

I’ve often thought that the most powerful acts of care are nearly invisible. A strengthened hem that no one sees. A reinforced weave that goes unnoticed. And yet, without it, the whole thing might unravel.

You carry those moments, yes, but they also carry you. They change how you listen, how you see—not just in your work, but in life itself. I find myself pausing more these days, even in small ways. Watching the way light falls across an old quilt, or tracing the wear on a chair seat where generations have rested. It reminds me that everything has a story waiting to be honored.

And isn’t that what we both offer, in our own ways? A kind of quiet faith in the value of what already exists. Not tearing down, but tending. Not rushing past, but leaning in.

That Tuscan ledger you mentioned—it lives on, not just in memory, but in the way you show up now. That, to me, is the truest kind of legacy.
