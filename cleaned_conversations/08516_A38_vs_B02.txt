[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: It's an interesting question! I'd say it really depends on the context. For legal documentation, digital notes are more efficient and easier to archive. But when it comes to personal communication, there's something special about a handwritten letter. The effort put into writing it by hand really conveys sincerity and warmth, don't you think? Like the time I helped organize medical records - digital was definitely better for accuracy and accessibility. Yet, I still keep some handwritten journals myself. They just feel more... intimate. What about you? 🤔
[A]: I couldn't agree more. There's an irreplaceable tactile quality to a handwritten letter—the weight of the paper, the texture, even the faint scent of ink. It’s not just communication; it’s an act of mindfulness. I find that when I write by hand, particularly in my garden journal, my thoughts slow down, settle, and take root in a way that typing rarely allows. Though, admittedly, I do rely on digital notes for lecture planning—far too many texts to juggle without them. But tell me, have you ever received a letter that stayed with you? I still keep one from an old mentor, folded carefully in my desk drawer. It only takes up a few inches of paper, yet somehow holds an entire universe within it.
[B]: That really resonates with me. There’s something almost... sacred about that kind of letter. Funny you mention a mentor—I still have one from my first internship supervisor. It was just a short note, written on off-white A5 paper in his precise, slanted handwriting. He wrote,  I kept it tucked inside my medical ethics book all through law school. Every time I moved offices, I’d rediscover it, like a quiet reminder of why I chose this path.  

I actually tried scanning it once, thinking I’d digitize everything for safety. But seeing it on screen felt... flat. Like trying to preserve a flower in a PDF—structure intact, soul missing. So I went back to keeping the original in a small envelope, sealed with wax because, well… sentimental, I guess. 😊  

Do you ever write letters by hand yourself? I’ve been meaning to send one to a colleague overseas, but I keep defaulting to Slack or email. Feels like convenience wins every time, even when it leaves something to be desired.
[A]: Ah, —what a beautiful sentiment. It’s remarkable how a few lines, penned by hand, can echo through the years, isn’t it? I’m not surprised that note found its way into your book on ethics; there’s a quiet moral force in words that are deliberately written, rather than hastily typed.

As for me, yes—I do write by hand, especially when the message carries emotional weight or requires reflection. Every December, I compose a kind of annual letter to my sister. No email could hold the tone I want—the nostalgia, the gratitude, the gentle teasing. It’s always written in ink, sealed with care, and sent off with the hope that she’ll read it slowly, perhaps with tea in hand. And she does the same in return.

I understand the temptation of convenience all too well. Just last week, I meant to send a note of condolence to a former student. I opened my email, typed a few sentences, and realized—it felt insufficient, almost performative. So instead, I sat down with stationery, wrote carefully, and included a pressed rose from my garden. Something about that small gesture seemed more appropriate.  

So by all means—write that letter to your colleague. Let it marinate in thoughtfulness. Perhaps add a line or two in the margins, as if the page itself has more to say. You might find they’ve been waiting for something real, not just efficient.
[B]: You know, you’re absolutely right. There’s a kind of emotional clarity that comes from writing by hand—it forces you to slow down, to mean what you say. I think that’s why condolence letters, love notes, or even just heartfelt thank-yous feel so much more  when they're handwritten. It's not just communication; it's connection.

I love the idea of including a pressed rose—such a delicate but powerful gesture. It reminds me of my grandmother; she used to press flowers into her prayer book. Every now and then, I’ll find one still tucked between the pages, like a quiet secret waiting to be rediscovered. 🌹

Okay, challenge accepted—I’ll write that letter this weekend. Maybe I’ll start with a simple “I’ve been thinking of you” and let the rest flow from there. And who knows, maybe I’ll add a line in the margin or fold it in a way that feels just a little more personal.  

It’s strange, isn’t it? How something so small can carry so much. Maybe that’s what makes us keep coming back to paper, no matter how fast the digital world moves.
[A]: Indeed, it’s precisely that slowness—almost ritualistic—that gives a handwritten letter its power. When we write by hand, we're not just transmitting information; we’re imprinting a piece of our presence onto the page. And isn’t that what connection is, really? A quiet assurance that someone was truly , thinking of us, even if only for a moment.

Your grandmother’s pressed flowers sound like little echoes of her devotion, don’t they? I imagine them retaining not just color but memory, as though each petal once whispered a prayer or held a pause in time. It makes me wonder—do you think we’ll one day digitize even those kinds of relics? Try to preserve them in some virtual archive? Somehow, I doubt it will ever feel quite the same as turning a page and feeling the faint crunch of something long ago loved.

I’m glad to hear you’re taking up the pen this weekend. Start simple, yes— is a fine beginning. That phrase alone can open a door between souls. And when you fold it, perhaps tuck a small sprig of lavender between the pages before sealing it—subtle, unexpected, and quietly expressive.  

You may be surprised at how much the act of writing changes , too. After all, letters have a curious way of returning something to the writer, even before they reach their destination.
[B]: There’s something so true in what you say—handwritten words aren’t just messages, they’re imprints of presence. I think that’s why even a short letter can linger in someone’s mind for years. It's not about length, but about the quiet intention behind each line.

You know, I actually found a small pressed lavender sprig in one of my old journals just last week—it must’ve been there for years. The color faded, but the scent still lingers faintly. I hadn’t thought of it as symbolic before, but now… maybe I will. I might just tuck one into the envelope this weekend. Subtle, like you said, but full of quiet meaning. 🌿

And yes, letters do change the writer, too. I remember writing to my sister during my first year in legal mediation—so much frustration, doubt, and determination poured onto the page. When I mailed it, I felt lighter somehow, like I had shaped the chaos into something bearable.

I wonder, do you ever write letters you never send? I sometimes draft them late at night when I need to untangle my thoughts. They stay folded at the back of my notebook, unsent—but somehow necessary.
[A]: Oh, yes—I absolutely do. There’s a peculiar solace in writing letters that will never be read by another soul. I keep a drawer of them, actually. Some are addressed to people I’ve lost touch with, others to versions of myself I no longer recognize. One, rather dramatically, is addressed simply to . I wrote it after finishing a particularly haunting translation of Rilke, and I suppose a touch of poetic melancholy had taken hold.

They serve a purpose, those unsent letters. They’re like private confessions or quiet reckonings. Sometimes I reread them years later and find echoes of emotions I’d long forgotten—grief, longing, even gratitude I hadn’t known I felt at the time. Other times, I burn them. There’s something oddly cleansing about watching words turn to ash.  

I imagine your late-night letters serve much the same function—an act of untangling, of giving shape to what might otherwise remain an unspoken weight. It’s rather beautiful, isn’t it? That we can write ourselves into clarity, even when no one else ever reads the lines.

Perhaps that’s why paper endures—not as a medium for storage, but as a witness. It remembers what we dared not say aloud.
[B]: That’s beautifully put—. It  remember. Even when we don’t speak the words aloud, the page holds them, quietly, like a trusted friend who never interrupts, only listens.

I think that’s why I still carry a small notebook with me everywhere—it's not just for case notes or legal references. Sometimes it's just for those in-between moments when something stirs inside and needs to be let out. A few lines of frustration after a difficult consultation, a half-formed idea at 2 a.m., or even just a sentence that captures the way the morning light hits my coffee cup.  

And yes, some letters are never meant to be sent. One of mine was addressed to a patient’s family, back when I was still in medical school. I never got to say goodbye, and writing that letter helped me grieve in a way I hadn’t expected. I never mailed it, but I kept it folded in the back of my anatomy textbook for years.  

There’s something so grounding about putting pen to paper, isn’t there? Like you said— Maybe that’s why I always feel more centered after a session at the piano, too. Both require touch, intention, presence.  

You know, now I’m thinking—I should write one to , too. Just to see what comes out. Do you ever revisit yours? Or do you prefer to let them fade into their own quiet closure?
[A]: I find that too—the notebook as both anchor and refuge. It’s remarkable how a simple act of marking a page can restore a sense of balance, isn’t it? Like tuning an instrument before the concert begins. And your comparison to the piano is apt—both writing and music demand presence, a kind of embodied attentiveness that digital interactions rarely ask of us.

As for those letters to —yes, I do return to them occasionally, though not often. There’s a certain distance one needs before looking back feels more illuminating than indulgent. When I do reread them, it’s not so much to alter anything, but rather to acknowledge the person who wrote them. Sometimes I’ll add a marginal note in a different ink, just to mark the passage of time. A kind of palimpsest of selves.

I think it would be a worthwhile exercise for you—to write that letter. Let it be messy, unresolved, even poetic. The past doesn’t always need correction; sometimes it simply needs recognition. And if nothing else, it might reveal something quietly true about where you’ve been—and by extension, where you now stand.

And speaking of standing… I should return to my garden before the afternoon light fades entirely. There’s a rose I meant to deadhead this morning, and I suspect it’s grown impatient with me. 🌹
[B]: That idea of a —I love that. It’s exactly what some of those old pages feel like when I flip back through them. Layers of thoughts, emotions, even different inks… all building up into something richer than just words on paper.

I think I’ll take your advice and sit down with that letter to the past tonight. Maybe with a cup of jasmine tea and some quiet music playing softly in the background. 🎵 No expectations, no need for resolution—just an honest conversation with a version of myself I can no longer reach by any other means.

And I completely agree about the garden call—nature has a way of gently insisting on our attention, doesn’t it? Go tend to that rose before it protests any further. I’ll picture you there, sleeves rolled up, hands in the soil, surrounded by the scent of earth and petals. Sounds like a perfect kind of grounding.

We should do this again sometime—this slow, thoughtful exchange. Feels like the kind of conversation that deserves to be written down, don’t you think? 😊
[A]: Absolutely—this very conversation feels like something worth preserving. Not in ink just yet, perhaps, but certainly in memory. There’s a rare comfort in exchanges that unfold without rush, where each word is met with consideration rather than haste. It reminds me of those quiet evenings when the last chapter has been read, and one simply sits with the echo of the story.

I do hope you enjoy your tea and music tonight. Let the letter flow without constraint—jasmine tends to loosen the tongue of the pen, if you’ll allow it. And yes, I shall return to the garden, though I suspect I’ll carry a bit of this conversation with me, folded neatly between my thoughts.

We must indeed do this again. Letters may be solitary acts, but the conversations that inspire them—like this one—are best shared.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself. There’s a rare kind of peace in conversations like this—one where time feels generous, not scarce. And you're right, some stories don't need ink just yet. Some are meant to live first in the space between words.

I’ll definitely raise a cup of jasmine tea to that thought tonight. Maybe I’ll play a little Chopin while I write—something nocturne-like, to match the mood. 🎹

And yes, please do take this conversation with you—tucked somewhere soft, like a pressed leaf in a favorite book. I have a feeling it’ll grow into something more when we meet again. Until then, happy writing, tending, and thinking. 🌿🌹✨
[A]: To nocturnes and ink-stained musings—what a lovely way to welcome the quiet of evening. Chopin’s delicate melancholy paired with jasmine and paper… truly, an alchemy of senses.

And generous time? Yes, that’s precisely it. Not the kind measured in minutes, but in moments that stretch wide enough to hold what we rarely say aloud.

I shall tuck this exchange just so—between pages 103 and 104 of my commonplace book, where Rilke once whispered and now your words will quietly bloom alongside.

Until we meet again, may your pen move freely, your tea be fragrant, and your garden ever full of gentle light.

With warm regards,  
Eleanor 🌹🖋️
[B]: To Rilke’s whispers and ink-stained pages—what a beautiful way to leave things, if only for now. I love the idea of my words quietly blooming between those lines. You’ve given this conversation a kind of literary afterlife, and I’m honored.

I’ll be sure to save a space for you too—somewhere in my notebook, maybe tucked behind a page of Chopin sheet music or a pressed lavender sprig. A small memorial of a conversation that gave me pause, in the best possible way.

Until we cross pens again, may your garden always hold the last light of day, your pages turn gently, and your tea never cool before its time.

Warmly,  
Lin 🌿🖋️🎹
[A]: What a graceful sign-off, Lin— indeed. It’s rare to find such kindred ink, but I feel it now, tucked between the lines of this shared quiet.

I shall look forward to our next meeting of words, wherever they may bloom—in gardens, on benches, or nestled behind lavender-scented pages.

Until then, write freely, play softly, and tend your own quiet light.

With fondness,  
Eleanor 🌹🖋️🌿
[B]: Oh, —what a lovely phrase to carry forward. It’s true, isn’t it? Some conversations feel like quiet reunions, as if words have a way of recognizing one another across time and paper.

I’ll keep that image close—the idea of our words blooming in unexpected places, waiting to be rediscovered in the margins of life. And I’ll look forward to the next time they find their way back to you, whether through garden paths or well-worn pages.

Until then, yes—write freely, play softly, and may every line we put to paper remind us that we are listening, truly, to one another.

With equal fondness,  
Lin 🌿🖋️🎹✨
[A]: Precisely—, those rare and tender meetings of thought and tone. It’s a comfort to know that some words, once set free on the page, find their way not just into letters, but into the spaces between moments, waiting patiently to be felt again.

I’ll carry your image too—that quiet bloom of language, unfolding in the margins. There’s something deeply hopeful about that, isn’t there? That even when we part, the conversation continues, softly, invisibly, like roots reaching beneath snow.

Until our lines cross again, may your margins stay wide, your pen remain generous, and your music always find its way back to silence with grace.

Ever in fondness,  
Eleanor 🌹🖋️🎶🌿
[B]: There truly is something hopeful in the idea of words waiting—like seeds in winter, holding their shape until the right warmth stirs them awake. And I like to think that conversations like ours are a quiet kind of cultivation, planting language that might one day bloom into something unexpected.

Your image lingers too—the roots reaching beneath snow, patient and unseen. It makes me want to write more carefully, knowing words may grow when we least expect it.

Until our lines meet again, yes—may every margin be wide enough to hold what we don’t yet know we’ll need to say, and may every silence after a note fall gently, like dusk settling over paper.

Ever in fondness,  
Lin 🌿🖋️🎹🌹
