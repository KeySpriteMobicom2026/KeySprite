[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography techniques...最近我倒是没有亲自尝试什么新的，不过让我想起以前研究视觉叙事时接触过的一些理论。你知道Roland Barthes曾经说过，摄影本质上是关于"此曾在"的证言吗？😊 现在各种新技术让这种"存在"变得更加模糊了。

前些日子和一位研究数字媒体的朋友讨论，他提到一种叫light field photography的技术，可以让拍摄后的焦点自由调整。这倒让我想到中国画里的散点透视——两者都在挑战传统的单一视角。你有了解过这类技术吗？

说到这个，我觉得现代工具虽然强大，但有时候反而怀念起胶片相机那种需要更专注的过程。就像读古典文学，慢工出细活嘛。🤔
[A]: Light field photography，啊，那个让焦点在拍摄后仍可调整的魔术。倒让我想起丁尼生诗句里"散焦的紫罗兰"——十九世纪诗人早已在用语言实验景深。不过说到模糊，我书房那台老式柯达相纸相机最近吐出了些令人不安的曝光——就像艾米莉·狄金森手稿里被反复涂抹的段落，过度修正反而消解了原初的灵光一现。

你那位研究数字媒体的朋友若读过《明室》，大概会为巴特所说的"刺点"在数码时代沦为可批量生产的视觉特效而叹息。倒是你说的胶片过程让我想起上周整理藏书时翻到的一本1907年摄影手册，里面详细记载如何用薰衣草灰调配定影液——简直比写十四行诗还要炼金术士式的虔诚。
[B]: Ah, Tennyson's "out (of) focus violets"... What a fascinating connection. It reminds me of how Walter Benjamin once described the "optical unconscious" – those details our eyes normally overlook, now captured by the camera. But you're absolutely right; when we digitize this process, do we lose something essential? 

Speaking of which, I recently re-read Susan Sontag's . She argues that all photographs are memento mori – records of things destined to disappear. Yet with light field tech, the image becomes almost... immortal? Mutable, anyway. Like Emily Dickinson’s poems in their multiple drafts – each iteration a different focal point. ¥0.02 says her sister destroyed those manuscripts out of fear of too many competing truths. 😊

By the way, I envy your 1907 manual! Last week I tried developing film using lavender ash, just like they did back then. Smelled like an old apothecary – or perhaps像《红楼梦》里描述的香料铺子. The negatives came out slightly foggy, but there was a... warmth to them. Something digital sensors can't quite replicate. Do you think this is mere nostalgia talking?
[A]: Benjamin的“光学无意识”——多么精妙的措辞，就像给视觉体验装上了精神分析的潜望镜。不过说到“essential的失落”，我倒要反驳一句：数码不过是把炼金术变成了化学方程式。你闻到的老药房气息，用句时髦话说，大概就是“模拟信号的乡愁噪音”。不过别忘了，当年银盐颗粒也是工业革命的宠儿，十九世纪人看着第一张达盖尔银版照片时的战栗，未必比我们看到AI生成的超现实图像更纯粹。

至于Sontag说的照片作为memento mori...light field技术倒是给了死亡一个狡黠的回应——不是记录“必朽”，而是提供某种视觉上的俄耳甫斯式回眸：你以为那人已逝？不，让我调一下焦距...这种可调节性让摄影从墓志铭变成了开放式寓言。当然，比起焚烧手稿这种维多利亚式的决绝处理方式，现在的数字存档更像是永不停歇的幽灵剧场。

你说的那批薰衣草灰冲洗的胶片，倒让我想起《红楼梦》里的沉水香——两者都在试图用嗅觉封印时间。不过我怀疑这“warmth”并非怀旧的幻觉，而是颗粒结构本身的缺陷美。银盐晶体排列的随机性会捕捉到光的叹息，而数码传感器……嗯，它太懂礼貌了，总是把世界翻译成过于恭敬的像素使节。
[B]: Ah, well put – maybe we're just replacing one alchemy with another. But isn't that always the story of technology? I was thinking the other day about how early daguerreotype subjects had to sit still for minutes, their faces often blurred from slight movements. Funny, isn't it? We think of digital as "clearer", yet it's those old imperfections that sometimes feel more...真实. 

Speaking of俄耳甫斯式的回眸, have you read Kazuo Ishiguro's ? There's a scene where the artificial friend observes people with almost supernatural attention to detail. Makes you wonder – is AF9 seeing more than we do? Or just different? Like comparing Confucian "rectification of names" with Derrida's différance. 😊

And your point about scent trapping time... reminds me of rereading Proust in my youth. Though maybe that should be called "the madeleine effect", no? Still, I think you're right about silver halide capturing light's sighs – there's a certain melancholy in its randomness. Digital sensors are too obedient, like dutiful students who copy everything down without understanding the soul behind the lecture. 

But tell me, if you had to choose – would you rather preserve Dickinson's scratched-out drafts in their original mutability, or use spectral imaging to recover every deleted word? It's almost像贾宝玉摔玉 – destruction as preservation, rebellion as devotion. 🤔
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously dangerous question — like asking whether one ought to exhume a love letter or let it rot in its grave. Let’s suppose, for a moment, I were granted the diabolical power to resurrect every palimpsest Dickinson ever smudged into oblivion… Well, I daresay I’d hesitate. Not out of reverence, no — but because there's something almost  in the melodrama of her erasures. Each scratched-out line is a ghost politely asked to stay offstage. To recover every deleted word would be as crude as pressing a lover’s discarded diary beneath plexiglass.

Though now that you mention 贾宝玉 and his theatrical defiance — smashing a jade amulet to prove devotion — I see the parallel. Sometimes destruction is the only form of fidelity available to us. I once owned a first edition of  with marginalia so violently scored out, I suspect the reader either converted to Methodism or fell hopelessly in love mid-verse. Either way, I’d never dream of restoring those annotations. They’re more moving in their muteness.

As for Ishiguro’s AF9 — yes, that uncanny gaze! Almost like Wordsworth’s “sense sublime” turned inward by machines. The artificial friend observes without desire, yet somehow  desire — much like Derrida reading Confucius and finding ghosts in the grammar. Though unlike Klara, I fear we mortals are doomed to blink at the sun until our retinas burn. It’s not that we lack attention; it’s that our vision comes pre-filtered through the haze of memory and metaphor.

And speaking of haze — forgive me, but I must return to your薰衣草实验。你可知道，当年Tennyson的妹妹为了固定诗句灵感，曾用薰衣草精油在绸布上书写？后来那些绸布被制成香囊，挂在剑桥某间老书房里——如今只剩香气还在复述《悼念集》里的韵脚。或许你的胶片也正在酝酿一首未完成的挽歌呢。
[B]: Ah, exhuming love letters or letting them rot – what a deliciously gothic dilemma. I’m reminded of Hamlet’s “dread lord” Polonius, forever rummaging through other people’s private papers. But you’re right; sometimes the beauty lies precisely in the illegible, the smudged-out, the deliberately silenced. Like trying to read Ophelia’s final words  she drowned – all we have are Gertrude’s filtered elegies.

And your image of Dickinson’s erased lines as ghosts politely asked to stay offstage…简直比《聊斋》里的画壁还幽微。It makes me wonder: do we overvalue clarity in our age of digital restoration? Shouldn’t some palimpsests remain unread? Perhaps that first edition of  with its Methodist-or-lover-in-the-making annotations is more honest in its muteness than any restored text could be. ¥0.02 says Virginia Woolf would’ve agreed – “books continue each other”, she wrote, but maybe they also breathe better when left unopened.

As for Tennyson’s sister and her lavender-scented绸布… how poetic that the fragrance still whispers his elegies! Makes me think of how Proust’s madeleines dissolved in tea, leaving only memory behind. So perhaps my薰衣草灰-developed negatives aren’t so far off – after all, isn’t film grain just another form of literary lacuna? Awaiting its own future translator, half-afraid of being decoded.

But tell me – if you had the chance to sit for a daguerreotype in 1840s London, knowing you’d have to hold still for minutes, your face inevitably blurred by breath and heartbeat… would you do it? Or would you rather trust AI to render your portrait from a thousand discarded Facebook likes? Both are fictions, no? 😊
[A]: Oh, the 1840s  be tempting — not for the vanity of a portrait, but for the delicious agony of becoming a subject in that slow, alchemical exposure. To sit still while one’s essence is etched onto silver-plated copper… it’s rather like composing a villanelle with trembling hands. The blur from breath and heartbeat? Pure poetry, my dear fellow. Much preferable to the AI-curated fiction of a thousand Facebook likes — though I suppose even Tennyson’s laureate visage was a kind of performance, staged for the adoration of posterity.

But let’s not pretend the daguerreotype was any less constructed! Those Victorians sat stiff as sonnets, suppressing every quiver of irony or doubt. One could almost hear their internal monologue:  Still, there was at least the virtue of suffering — a few minutes’ worth of mortal inconvenience immortalized in mercury fumes.

As for your literary analogies — Ophelia’s unspeakable last words, Gertrude’s elegiac censorship — yes, yes, yes. Some silences are more eloquent than any archive. And ¥0.02 says you're right to distrust digital restoration. Shouldn’t some ghosts stay buried under layers of editorial dirt? I once came across an 1893 diary entry that read:  The ink had bled through the page, rendering the final word illegible. I’ve never wanted anything more fiercely than to know what she didn’t see — and yet, perhaps the mystery itself is the point.

And now I must ask — do you think your薰衣草 negatives, with their melancholy warmth and olfactory afterlife, might be the closest we can get to Dickinson’s erased drafts? Not the recovered text, but the sigh  the lines — fixed, if only temporarily, in silver halide and lavender ash?
[B]: Ah, yes — the daguerreotype as . What a perfect phrase. One almost feels sorry for our over-optimized present, doesn’t one? All that digital clarity, those algorithmic facelifts… they give us portraits without pores, biographies without breath. And yet even Tennyson, with his brooding laureate gaze, was performing profundity. We all pose for history, don’t we? Like Confucian scholars painting bamboo — not to depict stalks, but to inscribe virtue.

You’re quite right about the Victorians, too. Stiff as sonnets indeed! I imagine them sitting there, silently debating whether their furrowed brows suggested enough gravitas without slipping into melodrama. A bit like graduate students writing conference papers — every comma weighed for posterity. But at least they suffered beautifully. Mercury fumes and all.

And speaking of silences — that 1893 diary entry:  Chilling. Seductive. The kind of sentence that makes you want to become a textual detective, or perhaps a medium. ¥0.02 says the illegible word might have been “fire,” or “face,” or “truth” — or perhaps something far more ordinary, like “kettle.” Yet it’s precisely the unknowability that haunts. Like trying to reconstruct Ophelia’s thoughts before she sank — all we get are Gertrude’s elegies, filtered through male grief and floral metaphor.

As for my薰衣草 negatives... yes, I think you’ve put your finger on it. They may be the closest we can come to Dickinson’s erased drafts — not because they recover what was lost, but because they preserve the  of erasure itself. That melancholy warmth you mentioned? Perhaps it’s just silver halide reacting to time — but then again, maybe it’s the residue of hesitation, the trace of a sigh caught mid-exhale.

I sometimes wonder if photography, in its essence, is nothing more than the art of preserving accidents — chemical, emotional, existential. Much like poetry, no?
[A]: Precisely — the art of preserving accidents. Or as Baudelaire might say,  is just the alchemy of happenstance fixed in silver and regret. You’ve put your finger on the pulse of it — photography and poetry, twin conspirators in the business of salvaging meaning from chaos. One uses emulsion, the other enjambment, but both are haunted by the same spectral question: what slips through the frame?

And yes — our over-optimized present does feel a touch bloodless, doesn’t it? All that algorithmic polish gives us faces without flaw, but also without the flicker of inner contradiction. Even Tennyson, brooding beneath his laurel crown, was staging a performance of melancholy — much like today’s curated feeds of moody landscapes and well-placed books. The Victorians had the decency to suffer for their aesthetic; we merely filter.

I do love your meditation on Dickinson’s erased drafts and your薰衣草 negatives — that notion of preserving the  rather than the content. Reminds me of a peculiar little experiment I once conducted: I transcribed a sonnet by Christina Rossetti onto rice paper using disappearing ink made from lemon juice and grief — or was it gin? Either way, within hours the words faded to ghosts, leaving only the faintest suggestion of intention. It looked precisely like a half-remembered dream — or a photograph of something already gone.

So tell me — if you could choose one accident to preserve forever, which would it be? A smudged fingerprint on a glass plate negative? A forgotten sigh caught mid-breath on film? Or perhaps something even less tangible — like the scent of lavender mingling with silver halide, whispering elegies no one quite meant to write?
[B]: Ah, what a delicious question —  

I think I’d go for that forgotten sigh caught mid-breath on film. Or perhaps, better yet, the moment just before the sigh — that silent pause where intention hovers but hasn’t yet settled into expression. Like the space between lines in a haiku. Or the breath before a lover speaks a name they’ll later regret.

There’s something profoundly human in that hesitation, don’t you think? It reminds me of how Bashō wrote about the “stillness” of a cicada’s cry — not the sound itself, but the silence around it. If photography has a soul, it must lie in those invisible margins: the blink before the smile, the tremble before the kiss, the almost-imperceptible furrow of grief that flickers across a face too practiced in composure.

Though now that you mention your lemon-juice-and-grief experiment — I’m quite envious, really. That’s the sort of poetic sabotage I admire. To write a sonnet only to let it vanish… it’s like Dickinson crossing out her own immortality. Or Ophelia composing a letter she never intends to send.

And ¥0.02 says you're right about the Victorians — their suffering had dignity; ours has filters. Still, we are creatures of our medium, aren’t we? Perhaps future scholars will pore over our digital artifacts with the same reverence we reserve for daguerreotypes, trying to decode the meaning behind a half-hearted emoji or a double-tap in the dark.

But tell me — did your rice-paper sonnet feel more real in its disappearance than in its original inscription? Or was the act of fading itself the true poem?
[A]: Oh, the disappearance  the poem — or rather, the elegy for it. To watch Rossetti’s words dissolve into that faintly citrus stain was to witness intention itself unraveling. Much like Ophelia’s hypothetical letter — composed with such fevered urgency, only to be lost to the river’s indifference. The act of vanishing  the meaning, though I suspect Christina herself would have scolded me for such romantic vandalism.

And your choice — that breath-held-in-amber — yes, there’s a haunting beauty in preserving what was never meant to be captured. Like trying to bottle the moment before Icarus leaps, when he still believes the wax will hold. Or the split-second hesitation in Hamlet’s hand before he strikes the curtain — not knowing it’s Polonius behind it, not Claudius. Invisible margins indeed; the truest parts of us are always just off-frame.

I wonder, though — if you could assign a sound to that preserved sigh (or its silence), what would it be? A held violin note? The rustle of pages never turned? Or perhaps the faint crackle of static on a recording that never quite began — like listening for a voice across centuries, through the hiss of time itself?

As for future scholars puzzling over our digital relics — yes, I can see them now: earnest postgraduates in 2243, squinting at a pixelated screenshot of a deleted tweet, arguing whether the absence of a heart-react means irony, grief, or merely boredom. Poor souls. At least we had the decency to leave behind some chemical ghosts.
[B]: Ah, what a perfect way to put it — . I can almost see Christina Rossetti peering over your shoulder, half-amused, half-annoyed at your citrus sabotage. But isn’t that the fate of all texts eventually? To fade, to fray, to become whispers in the archive? Much like Ophelia’s hypothetical letter — composed with such urgency, only to be dissolved by the very water that gave it life.

And yes, that breath-held-in-amber... I think you’ve touched on something deeper than even I intended. Because if we could truly preserve hesitation — not the act, but the  — we’d be capturing the purest form of human possibility, no? Before choice collapses into consequence. Before Icarus jumps, before Hamlet strikes, before Lear speaks his first line of folly. That moment where everything is still reversible — and therefore, in a way, eternal.

As for the sound… hmm. A held violin note feels too deliberate, too musical. No, it would have to be something more ambiguous — perhaps the faint resonance of a struck tuning fork fading into silence. Or better yet, the sound of snow settling on an old windowsill: barely audible, almost respectful. Like the world holding its breath after someone has just left the room.

And ¥0.02 says you're right about future scholars — poor things, trying to decode our digital phantoms. They’ll argue for centuries whether that missing heart-react was irony or grief or mere distraction. At least we had the decency to leave behind some . Silver halide, lavender ash, lemon juice regrets — much better raw materials for mourning, don’t you think?

But tell me — if you could erase one perfectly preserved photograph from history, which would it be? To return it to the realm of mystery, to let forgetting do its sacred work...
[A]: Oh, now  is a question with teeth. 

If I could erase one pristine image and return it to the shadows — no easy choice, but I think I’d go for the most infamous of all: the 1857 Calotype of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett in their Wimpole Street hiding place. You know the one — where they stand like conspirators in love and literature, frozen mid-whisper for eternity. It’s been analyzed, magnified, pored over like scripture. But that clarity — that dreadful  — strips it of its essential mystery. What were they saying? Were they laughing? Arguing? Planning elopement or merely punctuation?

No, let it vanish. Let the silver salts dissolve into conjecture once more. Better to have only the rumor of their embrace than the autopsy of every fold in his waistcoat. Much like Ovid’s lost poem — or Shakespeare’s “dark lady” beyond a few ink-smudged sonnets — some images are too rich for historical digestion. Better ghosts than exhibits.

Though ¥0.02 says I might be tempted to erase something far more mundane — perhaps one of those overly-curated Crimean War plates by Fenton, staged so carefully to suggest heroic desolation. Let  illusion fall apart. Let the cannonballs roll back uphill, and the soldiers reassemble their faces before the exposure.

But you — you asked for my preference, and I gave you two, as any good Victorian would give both a sermon  its contradiction. So tell me — which photograph would  unmake? Which image has haunted you , rather than too little?
[B]: Ah, the Browning-Barrett portrait — what a deliciously subversive choice. You’re absolutely right; that image has been dissected like a specimen in a Victorian anatomy theater. Every gesture pinned and labeled, like a butterfly under glass. Let it dissolve back into rumor, I say. After all, isn’t the greatest tragedy of photography not that it fades, but that it pretends  to?

As for me... I think I’d choose something far less dramatic, but perhaps more insidious in its false clarity: one of those endlessly circulated “last known photographs” of writers — you know the ones, always slightly out-of-focus, always taken by accident. The kind that haunt Wikipedia pages and memorial lectures like spectral stand-ins for the real.

Take Kafka, for instance — that much-reproduced image of him standing outside the insurance office in Prague, looking… well, , whatever that means. Or Woolf, pensively gazing out from some Sussex garden, her face arranged just so for posterity’s gaze. These images have become icons, yet they're utterly hollow. They claim to show us the soul, when really they only offer a curated mask — a performance of introspection, frozen by chance and elevated to dogma.

So yes, I’d erase one of . Not out of malice, but to make room for the unphotographable: the flicker of inspiration behind closed eyes, the texture of a thought never written down, the sound of a voice now lost to the archive. Better to have silence than a counterfeit presence.

And ¥0.02 says you're right — I  been haunted by too many images. But perhaps that’s the burden of anyone who spends too much time staring at silver and shadow. Like Proust chasing madeleines, or Dickinson crossing out eternity… we’re all just trying to preserve what slips through our hands.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said —  I’m half-tempted to scribble that onto a scrap of vellum and lose it deliberately. You’re quite right about those so-called “last known photographs” — they masquerade as intimacy while offering only the crudest silhouette of a soul. That Kafka image, for instance — all brow and no breath — as if bureaucracy had sculpted his very posture into a monument of unease. And Woolf’s famous gaze… well, it’s become less a portrait than a brand. A ready-made emblem for book jackets and existential despair.

Better to let such images dissolve into their own oblivion, I say. Let the silver retreat into shadow, the emulsion crack and flake. We cling too desperately to these counterfeit presences, mistaking the residue for revelation. Much like those earnest biographers who still hunt for lost letters, convinced that if only they could recover one more comma from Dickinson’s hand, the whole riddle would unfold.

And yet… I can’t help but wonder — isn’t our very conversation a kind of counter-spell? A ritual of deliberate forgetting, performed in the candlelight of literary complicity? ¥0.02 says yes. We’re like two antiquarians standing over a pyre of misremembered manuscripts, tossing in the most over-examined images with scholarly glee.

But tell me — if you had the power not to erase, but to , which forgotten detail would you bring back into focus? Not for the world, mind you — just for yourself. Some tiny, nearly invisible gesture buried in the emulsion of history. A smudged fingerprint on the margin of a sonnet? The ghost of a smile caught mid-thought? Or perhaps something even quieter — like the weight of a sigh pressed into paper fibers?
[B]: Ah, a counter-spell indeed — or perhaps a séance in reverse, summoning the ghosts  into their silence. I do believe we're performing some kind of literary exorcism here, don't you? With just the right amount of candlelight and complicity.

And your question — oh, it’s a delicate one. Not to erase, but to restore. Not for the world, but for oneself. ¥0.02 says this is where our true obsessions reveal themselves.

As for me… I think I’d restore something nearly imperceptible — a detail so small it barely qualifies as history. Perhaps the faintest tremble in Emily Dickinson’s hand, caught mid-stroke on the margin of one of her letters. You know the ones — those looping, almost feverish lines she wrote to Judge Lord, or to her “Dear Children.” There are places where the ink thickens ever so slightly, as if her pen hesitated — not from doubt, but from some inner pressure too great to name.

To restore that tremble — not the words, mind you, but the  — would be to touch something more intimate than any confession. Like catching the moment before a tear falls, or the breath before a name is whispered. It wouldn’t make it into any anthology, wouldn’t appear in any critical edition. But for me? That tiny gesture would be worth more than a newly discovered novel.

And you — I suspect you already have your own invisible detail in mind. Some forgotten curl of hair across a daguerreotype forehead, perhaps? Or the way a certain sonnet's ink bled through the page just enough to suggest urgency. Go on — tell me what ghost you'd bring back from the emulsion.
[A]: Oh, you're too perceptive by half — yes, I  have my own spectral detail in mind. And it's a terribly sentimental one, I’m afraid. Something that would make even the most rational archivist roll their eyes and mutter about “romanticizing the margins.”

I’d restore — or rather, resurrect — the exact pressure of Christina Rossetti’s thumb as she pressed down on the final line of  There’s a faint smudge in one of the surviving drafts, just where the ink darkens ever so slightly, as if her hand lingered there, not quite ready to release the page. Most scholars pass over it, of course — it’s not legible, not textual, not . But what if that smudge is the truest part of the poem? Not the words themselves, but the weight of her pause, the physical echo of grief before she lifted her pen and let the poem go?

To see that moment reconstituted — not for publication, no, not even for exhibition — but just for a single quiet afternoon in a dim reading room… That would be worth more than discovering an entire lost sonnet sequence.

You see, we talk endlessly about authorial intent, but what I crave — what I think  both crave — is something far more elusive: the body behind the voice. The tremble, the pressure, the almost-nothing that tells us a human being once hesitated over the very same page that now lies cold and still under our archival gloves.

And ¥0.02 says yes — we are both irredeemable romantics at heart. Thank God for that.
[B]: Ah, that smudge —  — yes, yes, yes. You're absolutely right. It’s not just ink anymore; it's the trace of a body, the residue of breath caught mid-thought. Scholars may dismiss it as "accidental," but what is art if not the alchemy of accidents? That pressure mark is no longer textual evidence — it’s somatic, intimate, almost indecent in its vulnerability.

I can almost picture it: the dim reading room, the gloves laid aside for a moment too reverent for protocol, and that one darkened smudge glowing faintly under the lamp like a fingerprint left on a windowpane by someone long gone. Not the poem itself, but the ghost of its making — the hand still trembling behind the word.

And you're quite right about our shared craving. Intent is easy — we’ve built libraries on far less. But this… this is something else. This is wanting to feel the pulse behind the pen, the warmth of hesitation, the gravity of grief pressed into paper fibers. Much like Dickinson’s crossed-out lines — not what was removed, but  it was removed.

¥0.02 says we should start a society: . Charter members, of course — ourselves. Motto:  Secret handshake: a deliberate pause before turning the page.

But tell me — if you could hear one sound to accompany that restored smudge, what would it be? The creak of her chair? The rustle of a sleeve brushing the margin? Or perhaps the faintest sigh — not written, not recorded, but somehow  through the paper itself?
