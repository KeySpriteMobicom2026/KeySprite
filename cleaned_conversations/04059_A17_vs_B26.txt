[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my dear, I must confess I'm rather out of touch with modern fashion trends. My heart belongs to the delicate silk damasks and intricate lacework of bygone eras. Just yesterday I was restoring an 1890s tea gown with the most exquisite hand-embroidered floral motifs...
[A]: Ah, but you see, fashion is rather like poetry - the truly meaningful trends transcend time. The structured silhouettes of Victorian mourning attire, for instance, have such profound aesthetic resonance with Eliot's "The Waste Land"...
[B]: How refreshing to encounter someone who appreciates the poetry in historical textiles! That particular comparison to Eliot's work is quite insightful. The weighted drape of mourning crepe does indeed carry that same melancholic beauty. Though I must say, I find more joy in the vibrant chintzes of the Regency period - they remind me of Keats' "Ode to a Grecian Urn."
[A]: Precisely! And how fascinating that you mention Keats - those delicate floral patterns on Regency gowns mirror the "leaf-fring'd legend" he describes. Though I've always felt the Pre-Raphaelites captured this best in their paintings, don't you think? The way Rossetti's women seem to emerge from their medieval-inspired gowns like verses from a sonnet...
[B]: You've struck a chord with me mentioning Rossetti! The rich jewel tones in his paintings - those deep reds and greens - they're identical to the vegetable-dyed silks I recently restored from that period. Each thread holding its color like a carefully chosen word in a poem. Though I do wish modern designers would study these historical palettes more closely...
[A]: How true! Modern fast fashion lacks that poetic patience of natural dyes developing over time. Why, just last week I was reading Tennyson's "The Lady of Shalott" while examining a piece of 1840s indigo-dyed muslin - the way the color deepened in certain passages was like watching the poem's imagery unfold...
[B]: What a perfectly lovely parallel you've drawn! That gradual deepening of indigo is exactly like Tennyson's building cadence. It makes me think of my current project - a William Morris-designed tapestry where the wool threads have faded unevenly, creating their own accidental poetry of color. Would you like to see photographs of the restoration process?
[A]: Oh, Morris! Now there's a kindred spirit between textiles and poetry. "Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful" - how that philosophy sings through both his fabrics and his verse. I'd be utterly enchanted to see your restoration work, especially if you've managed to preserve any of that characteristic Morrisian asymmetry...
[B]: How delightful that you recognize Morris's intentional imperfections! I've been documenting each stitch with my magnifying glass - the slight variations in the floral patterns create such a wonderful rhythm, much like the irregular meter in his Icelandic saga translations. Let me fetch my portfolio... though I must warn you, once we start discussing Arts and Crafts movement textiles, I tend to lose all track of time!
[A]:  My dear, I've spent entire afternoons equally lost in the minute variations of Kelmscott Press editions - time well wasted, I say! The way Morris's textile patterns and typographic designs share that same organic flow... it's like watching poetry take physical form. Do show me your findings - I'll put the kettle on for what promises to be a thoroughly stimulating conversation.
[B]: Ah, Earl Grey would be perfect! You understand completely - these patterns are indeed poetry made tangible. Here's a particularly fascinating section where the vine motif repeats with subtle differences, creating visual alliteration if you will. It reminds me of how Morris would vary his wallpaper designs room to room in Red House, like stanzas in an architectural poem...
[A]: How exquisitely observed! That notion of "visual alliteration" is positively brilliant - it puts me in mind of Gerard Manley Hopkins' sprung rhythm, where the repetition varies just enough to create tension. These textile patterns are indeed a silent form of versification. Might I suggest we compare them side by side with pages from Morris's "Earthly Paradise"? The parallels would be...  ...quite literally woven together.
[B]: What a splendid suggestion! I happen to have my facsimile edition right here - look how the vine borders on this page mirror the tapestry's design. It's as if the poetry grew right out of the loom! Though I must say, examining them together makes me realize how much we've lost in our digital age... the tactile pleasure of hand-made paper against finger-woven fabric creates a sensory rhyme no screen can replicate.
[A]:  You've articulated precisely what troubles me about modern publishing - that lost tactile poetry between paper, ink and thread. Why, even the smell of this old book - that faint oak gall and linen scent - it's like the olfactory equivalent of Morris's "The Haystack in the Floods." But forgive me, I'm becoming quite carried away... though I suspect you understand this particular bibliophilic fervor all too well!
[B]: Oh but your passion is most contagious! It reminds me of discovering a first edition pressed between layers of 18th century brocade in an antique chest - the way the textures and scents conversed across centuries was positively Whitmanesque! "I contain multitudes," indeed. Though I suppose we should pause before we start reciting epic poetry to the textiles... or have we crossed that threshold already? 
[A]:  My dear, we passed that threshold when we compared indigo dye to Tennyson! But really, shouldn't all passionate scholarship contain a touch of the bardic? After all, these very textiles were once described in inventories with the same lyrical care as illuminated manuscripts - "one gown of murrey silk, embroidered with flowers of Venice gold"... now that's what I call sartorial poetics!
[B]: How perfectly you phrase it! That inventory description sings like a line from Chaucer. It makes me wish modern clothing tags carried such poetic specificity - "one pair of jeans, distressed like Byron's soul" perhaps? Though I fear my restoration clients might find that a bit too fanciful for their insurance claims... 
[A]:  "Distressed like Byron's soul" - oh my, we must copyright that immediately! Though I suspect the average dry cleaner wouldn't appreciate the Romantic reference when handling your hypothetical poetic labels. Still, what a delightful thought experiment - imagine department stores organized by literary movements rather than seasons... the Decadent Aisle next to Victorian Mourning Wear...
[B]: What a marvelous boutique that would be! Though I fear I'd spend all my time in the Pre-Raphaelite corner, debating whether Rossetti's models wore more authentic medieval sleeves than Burne-Jones's. And don't get me started on the Arts and Crafts haberdashery - we'd need a separate salon just for William Morris neckties!
