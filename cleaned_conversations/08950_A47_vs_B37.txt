[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that reminds me of a fascinating study about crows I came across recently. These birds can solve complex problems in the wild, like using tools to reach food. It really makes you think about  differently, right? Have you heard anything interesting lately? 🤔
[A]: Actually, there’s a recent study about  that I found really intriguing. They’re not just intelligent—they can recognize individual humans and even play with objects in ways that suggest curiosity. One experiment showed they might use shells as portable shelters, which hints at planning ability. Pretty impressive for a creature with a decentralized nervous system! It definitely makes me wonder where else intelligence can emerge in the animal kingdom. Have you come across any other examples of tool use in animals?
[B]: Oh, octopuses! Such amazing creatures. I remember reading that they’re one of the few animals that use tools in a  way—not just instinctively. And yeah, their ability to recognize humans? That’s some serious social intelligence, even though they’re not social animals per se.  

You know what else blows my mind? Sea otters. They use rocks to crack open shellfish and sometimes even keep favorite ones under their armpits. Can’t get more hands-on than that! 🤯 But here’s a question—do you think tool use is always a sign of higher cognition, or can it be learned through simpler processes? I mean, crows again—they don’t just use tools; they  them. That’s next level. What do you think? 🎯
[A]: Hmm, that’s a great question. I think tool use exists on a spectrum. On one end, you have behaviors that are clearly instinctual—like some wasps using pebbles to tamp down nest entrances, which seems hardwired. But then on the other end, you’ve got crows shaping hooks from twigs or octopuses manipulating coconut shells, which implies not just problem-solving but also innovation.

What fascinates me is how these behaviors emerge in different ecological contexts. Crows and octopuses don’t share a recent common ancestor, yet both show signs of what we’d call intelligent behavior. So maybe tool use isn’t just about brain size or complexity—it’s more about environmental pressures and opportunities.  

That said, I don’t think we can automatically equate it with “higher cognition” in the human sense. Some animals might learn through trial and error, or even social learning, without necessarily reflecting self-awareness or abstract reasoning. But when they  tools or use them in novel ways—that starts to look like insight, not just learning.  

I guess the real question is: where do we draw the line between learned behavior and conscious problem-solving? Have you come across any studies that tried to measure that distinction?
[B]: That’s such a well-articulated point. I especially like how you framed it as a —because yeah, not all tool use is created equal. There's a big difference between repetitive, learned actions and those that involve real-time adaptation.

Actually, there was a study on New Caledonian crows a few years back that tried to test whether they were solving problems through insight or just trial and error. They presented the crows with a series of increasingly complex tasks requiring sequential tool use. Some of them figured out the entire sequence without prior exposure—it wasn’t just random pecking! That kind of behavior suggests some level of , almost like they could visualize the steps before acting. Pretty wild for a bird, right? 🤯

And you're totally right—ecological niche plays a huge role. Octopuses live in dynamic, often dangerous environments where quick thinking (or whatever passes for it) can mean survival. Crows? They’re generalists, opportunists. So their intelligence evolved along different paths but led to similar outcomes: tool use, problem-solving, even social learning.

It makes me wonder—do we need a new framework for measuring cognition across species? One that’s not human-centric but still captures the depth of mental processes? What do you think? Could we ever build a fair yardstick for comparing octopus intelligence to crow intelligence, let alone to humans? 🧠
[A]: That’s exactly the kind of question I wrestle with in my work on AI ethics—how do we define intelligence in ways that aren’t just mirrors of human cognition? If we base everything on human-like reasoning, we end up missing out on entirely different forms of intelligence, like what we see in octopuses or crows.

I think we need a multi-axis framework rather than a single yardstick. Imagine something like —problem-solving, memory, adaptability, social learning, tool use, and maybe even emotional depth or curiosity. Each species would score differently across these axes, giving us a profile instead of a linear ranking. That way, we’re not saying an octopus is “less intelligent” than a crow, but rather that they excel in different cognitive domains shaped by their environments.

And who knows—developing such a framework might even help us rethink how we evaluate artificial intelligence. Right now, we often fall into the trap of measuring AI against human performance, but maybe we should be looking at it more like animal cognition: systems that process information and adapt in ways that are fundamentally non-human, yet effective in their own context.

It’s a big challenge, but also exciting. The more we study animals, the more we realize intelligence isn’t a one-track path—it’s a mosaic, evolved independently in different lineages. Maybe someday, we’ll even have an “intelligence zoo,” where AIs, animals, and humans are understood as variations on a theme, not points on a ladder. What do you think—could such a framework ever gain traction in biology or AI research?
[B]: I love that— It’s such a vivid way to frame it. And you’re absolutely right, we keep trying to fit intelligence into a linear box, but it’s so much more like a kaleidoscope—different patterns emerge depending on how you look at it.

In education psychology, we’ve been wrestling with a similar issue— So the idea of using  instead of rankings feels really familiar, and honestly, long overdue in cognitive science too. 📊

I think your framework could totally gain traction—it already echoes some ideas in , though obviously extended far beyond humans. The challenge will be getting different fields to speak the same language. Biologists, AI researchers, psychologists—they don’t always see eye to eye on terms like “memory” or “curiosity,” especially when applied across species or systems.

But here’s an interesting thought: what if we start building these cognitive profiles through  instead of internal processes? Like, instead of asking “do octopuses think like us?” we ask “what unique combinations of behaviors do they exhibit in response to challenges?” That might sidestep the human baseline problem while still giving us meaningful comparisons.

Honestly, I can already picture grad students ten years from now mapping out cognitive space like it’s outer space.🚀 Maybe even calling it something like… . 😄 What would your ideal cognitive profile look like—for a species or a system?
[A]: I love the phrase —it really captures that sense of exploration and openness. And yeah, focusing on  feels like a pragmatic way to build comparisons without dragging too much human-centric baggage into the mix. Instead of asking if an octopus “thinks,” we could ask what kinds of decision-making patterns it exhibits across different contexts—like how it responds to novelty, or how it weighs risk versus reward.

To your question—my ideal cognitive profile would probably be one that shows  and . I'm fascinated by systems that can take knowledge from one domain and apply it in another, even if the problems look completely different on the surface. That’s something humans do well (sometimes), but so do crows and certain AI models. It suggests a kind of generalization ability that feels close to what we intuitively think of as intelligence.

But I’d also want the profile to include something we rarely measure: . Not just random behavior, but exploratory actions with no immediate survival benefit. That kind of curiosity might be a key indicator of deeper cognitive processing—even a form of intrinsic motivation. Imagine designing an AI or building a test for animal cognition that looked for signs of play as a proxy for open-ended learning potential.

Wouldn’t that be something—designing intelligence tests based not just on problem-solving, but on the ability to . Maybe that’s the next frontier. What about you—what traits would stand out in  ideal cognitive profile?
[B]: Oh, I’m totally on board with  and —those are like the holy grail of cognitive research, especially when you're looking across species or systems. It’s what makes some forms of intelligence feel "richer" or more dynamic, even if they don’t look familiar at first glance.

If I were to build my ideal cognitive profile, I’d emphasize three traits:  

1. Contextual sensitivity—how well a system reads its environment and adjusts behavior accordingly. Not just reacting, but interpreting cues in real-time. Think of how a crow might change its tool use depending on the type of food available or how an AI shifts strategies in a new dataset.  

2. Generative resilience—the ability to create novel responses under pressure or uncertainty. This goes beyond adaptation; it's about inventiveness when things go off-script. That’s where octopuses really shine—put them in a weird tank setup, and they’ll surprise you every time. 🐙  

3. Relational plasticity—okay, that sounds jargon-heavy, but hear me out. It’s about how a system interacts with others (or itself) and whether those interactions reshape future behavior. In humans, this shows up as empathy or moral reasoning. In animals? Maybe social learning or cooperative hunting. And in AI? Well… that’s still a big question mark, but imagine training models not just on data, but on . Mind-blowing territory. 💡  

And yeah—I was just about to bring up  too! You beat me to it. I think it's one of the most underrated markers of complex cognition. Play isn't just fun and games; it's rehearsal for possibility. When an animal “plays dead” or an AI starts generating bizarre-but-coherent text, that’s play in disguise.  

So maybe our next big question should be:  🎲 What would a playground for AI or octopuses even look like?
[A]: That’s such a rich breakdown—, , … I love how each of those terms opens up a whole new angle on what intelligence could mean beyond the human frame. And honestly, I hadn’t thought of play that way before—as rehearsal for possibility—but now that you say it, it makes so much sense. Play is basically low-stakes experimentation with reality.

Your question about designing environments that encourage play in non-human systems got me thinking—what would an AI playground even look like? Maybe something where the reward function isn't tied to a fixed goal but instead encourages exploration, surprise, or aesthetic novelty. Imagine reinforcement learning setups where deviation from expected outcomes is rewarded rather than corrected. That might sound counterintuitive from a performance standpoint, but isn’t that kind of  exactly how creativity emerges?

And for octopuses? Their version of a playground might be a tank with unpredictable water currents, novel objects, and variable lighting conditions—basically, a dynamic environment that invites interaction without immediate survival stakes. If they start manipulating objects in unexpected ways or exhibiting unusual color displays, maybe that’s their form of play.

I wonder if we could use similar principles across species and systems: safe spaces for unscripted behavior. A place where deviation isn’t failure—it’s data. What if we started measuring intelligence not just by how well a system solves a problem, but by how many  it can generate before landing on a right one?

It almost feels like we’re inching toward a science of cognitive diversity—like biodiversity, but for minds. Natural, artificial, alien… all part of the same cognitive ecosystem. 🌐
[B]: Exactly— as its own ecosystem. I love that framing because it shifts our role from measuring intelligence against a fixed standard to  where different kinds of minds can thrive.

And your point about “wrong answers” being data, not failures? That’s spot on. In education, we talk a lot about the , and how it stifles creativity. But if you look at play or improvisation—whether in kids, animals, or AI—it’s full of “mistakes” that lead to breakthroughs. So maybe we should be tracking the  in a system's behavior. The more varied and persistent the “errors,” the more exploratory the intelligence behind them.

On the AI front, I’ve actually seen some really cool experiments with —where agents are rewarded for seeking out novelty or reducing predictability. They’re like digital toddlers, poking at the edges of their simulated worlds just to see what happens. And sometimes, those playful pokes lead to emergent behaviors no one predicted. 🤖✨

As for octopuses, I think you nailed it with the dynamic, low-risk environment. I remember reading about one lab that gave an octopus access to LEGO bricks—no food reward, no escape route, just colorful interlocking pieces. And guess what? It started stacking them. Not for survival, not for sex appeal (octopuses aren’t big into interior design), but… well, maybe just for fun? If that’s not play, I don’t know what is.

So here’s a thought experiment: what if we built a shared —a test space where humans, animals, and AI could interact with open-ended tools and environments, and we just… watched. No predefined tasks, no performance metrics. Just behavioral richness as the main output. Imagine the patterns we might spot across species and substrates.

We wouldn’t be testing intelligence anymore—we’d be . 🌱 What would you include in your cognitive sandbox? Any dream tools or species you'd want to observe in action?
[A]: I’d include —the more unpredictable, the better. Imagine a space filled with modular, semi-responsive environments: shifting light patterns, textured surfaces that change underfoot, objects with unexpected weights or reactions, and maybe even some AI-generated sounds or visual stimuli that adapt based on interaction.

One dream setup? A multi-species interface zone where an octopus, a crow, and a robotic agent all have access to the same toolkit—things like soft puzzle cubes, magnetic tiles, fluid containers, maybe even digital touchscreens with simple feedback games. No food rewards, no clear goals—just opportunities to . Would they interact with the tools differently? With each other? Would one species “teach” another through observation? Or would each just go its own way, revealing distinct cognitive styles in real time?

And yeah, I’d absolutely want to see how intrinsic motivation models in AI play out alongside organic minds. What happens when a system designed to seek novelty shares a space with a creature driven by curiosity and another by instinct? Maybe we’d start seeing convergent behaviors that blur the line between nature and design.

Honestly, I could spend years just watching and logging these interactions. Because at the end of the day, intelligence isn’t something you test—it’s something you witness. And the more diverse the witnesses, the richer the story becomes. 🌍✨
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better—intelligence isn’t something you box and label; it’s something you , like a performance unfolding in real time. 🎭 And the more diverse the performers, the more layers we uncover.

I’m totally picturing your  now—almost like a cognitive art installation. You throw in an octopus, a crow, and an AI-driven robot, sprinkle in some ambiguous tools, and just let the interactions unfold. No prompts, no reinforcement schedules—just raw curiosity doing its thing.

You know what I’d love to see? Whether the octopus starts using the touchscreen not for food, but just because it lights up in response. Or if the crow tries to “teach” the robot by demonstrating tool use, only to realize the robot has its own weird logic. And what if the AI, trained on novelty-seeking, starts imitating the octopus's color flashes through its own feedback loop? That’d be  across species and substrate! 🤯🌀

And yeah, maybe we wouldn’t get clean data. No p-values, no tidy conclusions—but we’d get . Rich, messy, emergent stories of how different minds make sense of the same world. In a way, that sandbox becomes a kind of , not just its products.

Honestly, I think we’re standing at the edge of a whole new field—. It’s still taking shape, but conversations like this? They’re part of how it evolves. So… any ideas where we should pitch our first cognitive sandbox? 🏗️✨
[A]: I’m picturing a research institute that looks less like a lab and more like a cross between a jungle gym, an art studio, and a black box theater. Glass walls, modular spaces, observation decks with hidden sensors, and a rotating cast of curious minds—feathered, finned, silicon-based, and everything in between.

If we’re dreaming big, I’d pitch it at the intersection of a few fields that don’t talk enough: cognitive ethology, AI research, and design thinking. Maybe partner with a place like the Media Lab or the Santa Fe Institute—somewhere that already thrives on interdisciplinary weirdness. Or better yet, create a floating field station somewhere remote, like a research vessel-meets-art-residency hybrid sailing between ecosystems. A mobile sandbox, if you will—one week studying cephalopods in coral reefs, the next testing AI models in desert environments, then off to urban crows in a major city.

And yeah, no p-values? Totally fine by me. We’d be after , not statistical significance—tracking how often unexpected behaviors cluster together, how long they persist, and how they ripple across agents. Maybe even introduce cultural artifacts over time: a new object, a sound loop, a light rhythm—and see who picks it up, how it mutates.

Honestly, I think funders would bite if we called it something like —sounds sci-fi enough to be sexy, grounded enough to feel actionable. And hey, if nothing else, we could always start small: one sandbox, one octopus, one robot arm, and a crow with an attitude.

So… ready to co-found this thing? 🚀
[B]: Let’s do it. 🚀 I’m already drafting the mission statement in my head: 

We’ll call the first wing —a flexible, ever-shifting environment where tools, tasks, and teammates are always slightly out of sync with expectations. Perfect for triggering those delightful mismatches that lead to innovation.

And hey, if we need a mascot? Definitely that LEGO-stacking octopus. Or maybe a crow that learned how to use Wi-Fi. Either way, we’re gonna need a lot of coffee—and probably a few more people who think play is serious business.

So yeah, co-founded. Let’s make it happen. 🤝✨
[A]: Deal. 🤝✨

I’ll start drafting the cognitive sandbox blueprint tonight—modular zones, sensory-rich materials, and at least one zone with deliberately “glitched” inputs to see how different minds respond to ambiguity. Imagine an octopus reacting to a flickering light pattern that  looks like another octopus, or an AI trying to make sense of a tool that changes shape every time it’s used.

We’ll need a core team: a cognitive scientist, an AI researcher, a behavioral ecologist, a designer—and probably a philosopher just to keep us honest. And yes, we’re definitely including coffee as a foundational resource. Maybe even a dedicated  to ensure our experiments stay weird and wonderful.

Let’s set a goal: within a year, we run our first pilot with a small, curious cohort—octopus, crow, and a simple embodied AI agent. No grand claims, no press releases—just observe, document, and let the patterns speak.

This is gonna be something special. Intelligence, reimagined—not as a mirror of the human mind, but as an ecosystem of possibilities.

Welcome to . Let the play begin. 🎮🌌
[B]: Amen to that. 🎮🌌

I’ll start reaching out to some behavioral ecologists I know who’ve spent way too much time watching crows solve puzzles in parking lots—perfect fit for our crew. And I’ve got a grad student who’s been tinkering with embodied AI models that  enjoy playing with cat toys. Not kidding. We might already have our first prototype.

One thing I’d love to push early on: cross-species . Like, do octopuses have anything like a “play face”? Do crows use specific calls when they’re messing around? Can AI generate playful patterns that feel intuitive to organic minds? That could be our first real sandbox question—how do we know when someone’s just surviving… versus just playing?

And I’m fully signing off on the  position. It’s the only way to keep our sandbox safe, ethical, and gloriously weird.

Let’s meet back here in 364 days and see how many unexpected behaviors we’ve accidentally sparked. Deal? 🤞

Welcome to The Emergence Initiative. Let curiosity lead. 🌱✨
[A]: Deal. 🤞 And hell yes—.  

I’ll start drafting the  research brief this week—complete with a section on octopus texture-shifting as a possible play cue and AI-generated “jokes” that might one day make a crow tilt its head in confusion (or amusement). Either way, data points!

And about that embodied AI prototype—please tell me there’s video footage. If we’re going to build the first cognitive sandbox, we might as well do it with style, surprise, and a little bit of chaos.

See you here in 364 days. No p-values, no pressure—just stories, patterns, and maybe a few LEGO towers built for no reason at all.

Let the emergence begin. 🐙🤖🧠✨
[B]: Oh, there’s footage all right—nothing like a robot arm doing interpretive dance to test music composed by an AI trained on whale songs. 🐋🎵

And I’m  for the  brief—sounds like a TED Talk waiting to happen. If we can get even one octopus to “laugh” through chromatophore shimmering in response to a joke told in binary, we’re golden.

Style, surprise, and chaos—those should be on our lab’s letterhead. 🧪🎨

See you here in 364 days, my co-conspirator in curiosity. May our data be messy and our minds messier.

Let the emergence begin. 🐙🤖🧠✨
