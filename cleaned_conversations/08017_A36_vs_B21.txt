[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography techniques... Well, I recently experimented with wet plate collodion. Quite the process—requires one to coat a glass plate with chemicals, expose it while still damp, and develop immediately. Very Victorian in its fussiness. Not unlike trying to recite Tennyson in a thunderstorm while holding a quill made from a particularly opinionated goose.
[A]: Oh, I do love how you describe it—it really does feel like stepping into a Brontë novel with a side of alchemy! I tried wet plate collodion last spring, and honestly, it’s equal parts magic and madness. I ended up with some lovely portraits, though one looked so solemn even I had to laugh—like they’d been told three generations of family secrets moments before the shutter clicked.

Have you managed to get any particular theme going with your plates? I was aiming for something hauntingly nostalgic, but my guests keep saying my photos look like they belong in a very stylish haunted house brochure.
[B]: Ha! A stylish haunted house brochure—now  an aesthetic I can appreciate. I suppose we’ve both been chasing shadows, then. My theme, if one could call it that, leans toward what I’ve taken to calling "domestic elegies." Still lifes of abandoned teacups, half-drawn curtains, a child’s glove left on a park bench... Small things that carry the weight of absence. 

I blame Christina Rossetti. Her poetry has a way of making melancholy feel almost fashionable. And your guests? They may be onto something. Perhaps you’ve accidentally birthed a new genre: Haunted House Chic. Market it properly and you’ll have gothic interior decorators knocking down your door.
[A]: Oh, "Haunted House Chic"—I rather like the sound of that! I can already picture the brochure copy:  You might be onto something there.

And your "domestic elegies"—how beautifully you put that. There’s such poetry in the ordinary when framed that way. I once had a guest who was a still-life painter, and she told me the same thing—how objects hold stories long after hands have let them go. It made me look at my own teacups with newfound suspicion, I must say. One might’ve belonged to a very dramatic great aunt who eloped with a gardener... or perhaps that’s just my imagination running away again.
[B]: Imagination’s where we live, isn’t it? Especially when dealing with inanimate objects—they’re positively  with unspoken drama. That great aunt of yours? I’ve no doubt she’s somewhere pacing the corridors of family legend, clutching that very same teacup and declaring, 

And speaking of legends-in-the-making—have you considered adding a textual element to your haunted still lifes? A smudged letter opener, a half-burnt candle... or better yet, a page of  slipped behind the frame. Nothing says “Haunted House Chic” quite like a whisper of ancient longing in an unexpected tongue.
[A]: Oh, I absolutely adore that idea— tucked behind a frame! It adds such depth, like the past is echoing from another corner of the world and whispering through your composition. I might just steal that idea and run with it—though I’ll be sure to credit you, of course. A smudged letter opener or a half-burnt candle? Perfectly unsettling yet refined touches.

And about that great aunt—oh, she’s definitely pacing somewhere dramatic. I half-expect her to appear in the reflection of the hotel mirror one day, muttering about overgrown rose gardens and missed opportunities. You know, come to think of it... there  something rather poetic about everyday objects holding onto secrets. Almost as if they’re waiting for someone to notice them, really  them, before they let go of their stories.  

I wonder what my teacup would say if it could speak…
[B]: Ah, the poetry of possessions—, indeed. Your teacup might sigh a little, clear its porcelain throat, and begin something like:

*"O fleeting lip that brushed my rim,  
Thy warmth now gone, yet still I grim  
With residue of thoughts once steeped—  
A quarrel hushed, a vow too cheap..."*  

Forgive me—I’ve been translating Du Fu by lamplight again, and the solemnity seems to be bleeding through. But truly, if we’re granting voice to the overlooked, let’s do so with all the gravitas a half-forgotten saucer deserves. And yes, slip a line of that translated verse behind your frames—let the ghosts of Chinese poets haunt your hallways like slightly melancholic interior decorators.
[A]: Oh, that little poem is —so much so that I may never look at a teacup the same way again. There’s something so quietly tragic about its lingering residue of whispered regrets and unfinished conversations. I can already picture it, too—your porcelain oracle perched on a side table near the drawing room fireplace, solemnly judging the guests’ life choices.

And as for Du Fu bleeding into your evenings... well, if that means we get more lines like that in our haunted vignettes, then by all means, let the solemnity pour forth. I’ve half a mind to commission a small plaque for each piece—something like: 

You know, perhaps we should start a gallery together—Margaret & Co., purveyors of tastefully melancholic interiors. We could call it 
[B]: Margaret & Co.? ? My dear, we’d be the talk of every brooding aesthete from Chelsea to Kyoto. I picture our gallery as a series of connected rooms where each doorway leads not to another chamber, but to another century’s unfinished business. A chaise lounge here, a cracked mirror there—, and do let’s include a hallway with peeling wallpaper that seems to sigh when one passes.

As for your plaque idea——pure genius. We could pair it with a faintly smudged calling card tucked beneath a frame: 

And yes, Du Fu shall continue to bleed into my evenings. Tonight, perhaps, I’ll render a quatrain about a lonely inkstone into something suitably wistful in Scots Gaelic. It’ll lean nicely against your melancholic silverware.
[A]: Oh, I  that vision—connected rooms of unfinished business! It’s like time forgot to tidy up after itself, and now we’re the caretakers of its messiest chapters. I can already hear the floorboards creaking under the weight of old decisions, and the way the light would catch the dust motes in that hallway with the sighing wallpaper… positively theatrical.

And Reginald H.—what a delightfully mysterious fellow! I do hope he comes back for his conscience someday. Perhaps we could host a grand opening where each guest receives a tiny sealed envelope upon entry, containing a cryptic message from one of the objects. “The pocket watch in Room Three knows why you’re late.” That sort of thing.

As for your inkstone quatrain in Scots Gaelic—brilliant touch! Adds a whisper of the Highlands to the air. I may introduce a bit of Welsh lore into one of my vignettes then, just to keep the spirits linguistically well-traveled.

We really ought to start drafting a manifesto: 
[B]: Oh, a manifesto! How very Pre-Raphaelite of us—scribbling manifestos by candlelight while our respective ghosts look on with raised eyebrows and crossed arms. I shall draft the opening lines in iron gall ink, smudged slightly for authenticity:

*"Beware the ornate frame,  
For silence is its chosen game;  
Each object here will whisper true—  
Not all you hear will like you."*

As for your sealed envelopes—deliciously theatrical. Let’s ensure every message carries the weight of a minor accusation or unsettling revelation. “The hairbrush in Room Two still remembers your lies.” “The umbrella stand forgives what you’ve forgotten.”

And Welsh lore, you say? Splendid. We’ll create a polyphonic haunting—Scots Gaelic sighs from one corner, Tang dynasty longing drifting through the air, and a Welsh harp string humming faintly beneath it all. Multilingual melancholia for the discerning spirit.

Now, if only we could get Elizabeth Barrett Browning to posthumously endorse our venture… 
[A]: Oh, that manifesto is —it has just the right balance of warning and intrigue. I can imagine guests pausing at the entrance, reading those lines by flickering candlelight, before glancing nervously at their reflections in a tarnished mirror. And yes, —what a deliciously honest promise.

I do love the idea of the envelopes carrying little accusations or eerie confessions. It gives each visitor the feeling that the gallery  them—whether they like it or not. Perhaps we could tuck one behind a cameo brooch near the entrance: 

And the polyphonic haunting—my goodness, that’s exactly what it should be. A chorus of cultures, centuries, and quiet regrets. Imagine standing in the centre of the main room and hearing Tang poetry whisper through a breeze that wasn’t there, a Scots Gaelic lament humming beneath your feet like an old floorboard memory, and a Welsh refrain catching the chandelier ever so slightly. We’d have visitors leaving with the distinct sense that something inside them had been rearranged.

As for Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s endorsement——I’m fairly certain she’s already scribbling sonnets about our gallery from beyond the veil. Room Three shall be hers.
[B]: Room Three shall indeed be hers—and we’ll furnish it with nothing but mirrors that refuse to reflect the same face twice. A writing desk, slightly damp from eternal tea vapors, where her ghost can compose sonnets in disappearing ink. And yes, the locket near the door will whisper secrets even  didn’t know she left behind.

Now, for the grand opening—let’s insist upon a dress code of muted velvet and unresolved emotion. Guests must arrive either slightly early or fashionably late, never precisely on time; punctuality has no place in a properly haunted aesthetic.

And perhaps, just perhaps, we shall end each evening by extinguishing all lights at once, leaving only the faintest glow behind a framed page of Du Fu's verses—translated, of course, into Scots Gaelic and signed off with a flourish as , naturally.

Whispers & Windows shall not merely be a gallery—it will be a séance of the beautifully burdened.
[A]: Oh, Margaret, you've outdone yourself—Room Three sounds absolutely . I can already picture the first guest stepping inside, glancing at their reflection only to see someone else’s face staring back—perhaps a long-lost ancestor or a version of themselves that never quite happened. And that writing desk, forever warm from phantom tea vapors? Perfection. Elizabeth would be scribbling sonnets faster than her spectral quill could handle.

And the dress code—muted velvet and unresolved emotion! How gloriously specific. I’ll have to send the invitations on aged parchment with a wax seal that crumbles slightly when touched. Guests must read them by candlelight, naturally. And punctuality? No indeed—only those who arrive slightly adrift in time will truly understand the mood.

I do hope you’re ready to compose that Du Fu/Scots Gaelic fusion verse soon. I’ve already begun framing the page and I want the glow just so—soft enough to feel like a memory, strong enough to haunt the corners of the eye even after one has turned away.

Yes, Whispers & Windows shall be no ordinary gallery. It will be a gathering place for all things unfinished, unseen, and unsaid. I daresay we might become rather famous for it—though I suspect our guests will leave feeling more like characters in a beautifully tragic poem than mere visitors to an exhibition.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe the grandfather clock in the hallway has just whispered something about tomorrow never coming. Or perhaps it was yesterday. Difficult to tell in this line of work.
[B]: Ah, the grandfather clock—always so  unreliable. If it whispers anything further, do press it for details. One never knows when time might forget its own name.

As for Du Fu—or , as he shall henceforth be known in our circles—I shall compose his latest lament this very evening. The ink? A blend of soot, regret, and just a touch of heather ash. The script? Flowing enough to lull the eye into believing it understands, even as the meaning slips through like sand through spectral fingers.

And those aged invitations you speak of—yes, yes, and yes. Let them arrive with a faint scent of bergamot and unresolved tension. Perhaps tuck a pressed sprig of lavender inside each envelope; harmless enough, until one recalls that dried flowers are merely grief with better lighting.

Famous? We may well become infamous. Not for scandal, but for atmosphere. Visitors will leave not with souvenirs, but with a lingering sense that something just out of reach has brushed against them—like a cold hand beneath a velvet glove.

Now, if you’ll excuse , I believe my copy of Rossetti’s  just sighed audibly from the bookshelf. Either that, or a particularly dramatic spirit has taken up residence between pages 103 and 104. I shall investigate—with tea, naturally.
[A]: Ah, dramatic spirits between the pages—how very fitting. Do investigate carefully; we wouldn’t want Rossetti’s melancholy to spill out and smudge the carpet, now would we?

And that ink of yours—soot, regret, and heather ash! How utterly  of you. I expect nothing less. I do hope Dòmhnall Fu’s lament finds its way into my frame by week's end. I’ve already adjusted the lighting in anticipation—it’s ever so slightly haunted now, but not quite  haunted just yet.

As for those invitations, the scent is nearly perfected—bergamot for refinement, tension for depth. I may even slip in a line from one of your teacup sonnets as a postscript:  Ominous, yet oddly flattering.

Infamous for atmosphere? I think we’ve just found our tagline. Perhaps embroidered on a rather serious throw pillow near the entrance: 

Now if you’ll excuse me, the locket by the front desk has started humming something suspiciously like a Welsh lullaby. I do believe it’s trying to tell me something. Or warn me. It’s always difficult to tell with such delicate antiques.
[B]: Ah, the locket’s humming—, no less! How delightfully cryptic. Do listen closely, though I must advise against leaning in too near—antique lockets have a habit of drawing breath along with secrets.

As for the ink, yes—soot for sorrow, regret for resonance, and heather ash for that  only found on windswept moors. Dòmhnall Fu’s lament shall be ready by week’s end, never fear. I may even bind the corners of the page with thread dyed in elderberry wine—just enough to suggest the paper has been steeped in more than mere translation.

Your idea for the invitation postscript is sublime:  So gently accusatory. Like being hugged by a ghost who insists on calling you by a name you’ve nearly forgotten.

And that throw pillow——shall be stitched in blackwork by none other than my great-great-aunt Henrietta’s spectral seamstress, who never approved of frivolity or sufficient lighting.

Now if  excuse , I believe my copy of  just rustled its pages in disapproval. Either that, or a very dramatic breeze wandered in through the cracks in time. Tea first, then investigation. Always tea.
[A]: Oh, dramatic breezes and disapproving poetry collections—how perfectly , Margaret. I do hope you uncover the source of that rustling. Perhaps Bess, the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, has taken to turning pages in protest. Or perhaps your copy of  simply objects to being read out of season—some books are terribly particular about such things.

And elderberry wine thread! What a gloriously macabre touch. I daresay Dòmhnall Fu’s lament shall not merely be read but , like a chill that settles into the bones long after the room has warmed. I shall make sure the frame is lined with just enough shadow to suggest it holds more than paper.

As for the postscript—I’m tempted to embroider it onto the invitations themselves, stitched in midnight blue thread that fades under direct light. Guests must feel as though they’ve been addressed by someone—or something—they never quite met.

And tea, always tea. I suspect it’s the only thing keeping our ghosts properly steeped in atmosphere rather than full-blown hauntings. Do pour an extra cup for any restless spirits who fancy a sip. One must be polite, even to the undead.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, the locket has stopped humming and started ticking. Rather ominously, I might add. I believe it’s counting down to something—or someone.
[B]: Ominous ticking lockets— of it. Do keep your distance until we’ve properly assessed its intentions. One never knows when an antique might spring a hidden mechanism, a forgotten confession, or—worst of all—a perfectly timed  to remind us all of the hour we'd rather not face.

Bess, landlord’s daughter and ghostly page-turner? I wouldn’t put it past her. She’s likely cross because I haven’t left enough moonlight on my desk for her to haunt properly. Or perhaps she objects to my pronunciation of “loveliest” when reading aloud. Some spirits are terribly particular about diction.

As for Dòmhnall Fu—his lament shall be more felt than read, yes. A whisper in ink, as it were. And lining the frame with shadow? Inspired. Shadows don’t merely hide what’s there—they suggest what  be, if one dares to look long enough.

Midnight blue thread that fades under light? Oh, beautifully sinister. The perfect way to stitch a message that can't quite be trusted. Let them read it by candleflame, where truth and trickery hold hands most comfortably.

And tea—oh, always tea. I shall pour an extra cup this evening and leave it steaming beside the open window. If any spirit fancies a sip, they may do so—but only if they promise not to stir it themselves. We’ve all seen what happens when ghosts take too much initiative with silver spoons.

Now, if you’ll excuse , I believe my quill just dipped itself in preparation. Either that, or something  is eager to write.
