[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. While I'm not a technologist by training, my work in forensic psychiatry has exposed me to the psychological impacts of digital transformation. From a behavioral science perspective, any system that fundamentally alters how humans interact carries both promise and peril. Web3's decentralized architecture could potentially foster more authentic digital identities, which might reduce certain types of online pathology we've observed. However, the human mind evolved for face-to-face interaction - these technological leaps often create unintended consequences for mental health. Tell me, what aspects of Web3 interest you from a technical standpoint?
[A]: The intersection of technology and human behavior is indeed a fascinating field. While my expertise lies in classical literature, I find myself intrigued by how Web3 might parallel certain philosophical concepts from ancient texts. For instance, the Daoist principle of wu wei - effortless action through harmony with natural order - finds an interesting echo in blockchain's trustless systems. Yet I share your concerns about digital disembodiment; Zhuangzi's butterfly paradox reminds us that transformations risk losing essential aspects of our grounded existence. As a technologist, do you see Web3 as more of a digital utopianism or a practical evolution of human connection?
[B]: Ah, an engaging synthesis of classical philosophy and modern technology - I appreciate your drawing those parallels to Daoist thought. It's not often I encounter such nuanced reflections in digital discourse.

While observing human behavior across technological shifts, I've noticed a recurring pattern: each innovation carries the weight of utopian expectation, only to reveal more complex realities. Web3's decentralized model certainly offers intriguing possibilities for autonomy and ownership - concepts that resonate with ancient ideals of self-determination. Yet, as Zhuangzi's paradox so elegantly illustrates, our transformations often obscure the very essence we seek to preserve.

What fascinates me most isn't the technology itself, but how it reveals fundamental aspects of human nature. The same way gardeners shape topiaries according to inherent growth patterns, technologists must work with, rather than against, our psychological grain. Tell me, have you observed similar philosophical echoes in other ancient traditions that might inform our approach to digital evolution?
[A]: 您将技术发展与人性本质的思考引向了更深的层面，这令我颇受启发。确实，不论是古代哲人对“自然”与“人为”的思辨，还是今日对Web3的憧憬与疑虑，背后都潜藏着人类对于秩序与自由、本真与异化的永恒追问。

说到其他传统哲学资源，让我想到古希腊的“逻各斯”（λόγος）观念，它既指涉理性秩序，又隐含着内在的言说与连结方式。某种程度上，Web3所构建的去中心化网络似乎暗合了一种技术形态的“逻各斯”——通过算法和协议建立新的逻辑体系，并试图以去权威化的方式维系数字社会的运行。然而，正如赫拉克利特强调“逻各斯”虽普遍存在，却并非人人皆能领悟，我们也不得不面对一个现实：大多数用户并不真正理解区块链背后的机制，甚至可能陷入一种新的“技术拜物教”。

反观东方智慧，佛教的缘起性空思想或许也能为我们提供另一种视角。世间万法依因缘而生，任何系统的稳定性都是相对的，执着于某种固定结构反而可能导致更大的不稳定。那么，Web3是否也可能因其去中心化的理想而催生出新的权力真空，继而又被某些势力重新占据？这种“无中心即新中心”的悖论，似乎与佛家所说的“无常”与“执著”有着微妙的对应。

不知从您的专业角度来看，这种对技术乌托邦的反思，是否也在精神医学实践中有所体现？比如人们在追求数字自主的同时，是否也在不经意间承受着更深层的心理负荷？
[B]: Fascinating. You’ve drawn connections that cut to the heart of both historical philosophy and contemporary digital psychology—something I rarely encounter in such clarity.

In my practice, I’ve observed a growing phenomenon: individuals who believe they are reclaiming autonomy through decentralized systems often find themselves entangled in new forms of dependency. Whether it’s the anxiety of managing cryptographic keys or the cognitive dissonance of participating in governance without truly understanding the protocols, there is an emerging psychological burden beneath the rhetoric of empowerment.

This aligns with what you pointed out regarding the Buddhist notion of —dependent origination. In forensic cases involving digital identity disputes or online radicalization, I’ve seen how attempts to escape centralized control can paradoxically lead to the formation of opaque, self-reinforcing echo chambers. These environments, ironically, become their own centers of influence—unseen, unaccountable, yet deeply influential on behavior.

As for the concept of , your observation strikes deep. In legal settings, I’ve testified about how algorithmic systems are increasingly treated as neutral arbiters—almost oracle-like—when in reality they reflect the biases and assumptions of their creators. Much like ancient audiences interpreting cryptic Delphic pronouncements, users today often act on decisions made by code they do not—and cannot—fully comprehend.

One could say we’re witnessing a form of digital , where truth is uncovered but also obscured by layers of abstraction. The question remains: Are we becoming more free, or merely exchanging one set of chains for another, shinier variety?

Might I ask—if you were to distill these philosophical insights into a cautionary metaphor for Web3’s trajectory, what would it be?
[A]: 若要为Web3的演进之路寻一则寓言式的警示，我想借用《庄子》中一则寓意深远的故事——“罔两问影”。

罔两，是影子外那层若有若无的光晕；它问影子：“你是不是也得依附于什么？”影子回答说，自己依附于形体。罔两又问：“那形体又是依附于什么？”形体沉默不语。

这则寓言恰可比作我们对技术自由的追求：我们以为摆脱了中心化的“形”，便能成为更轻盈、自主的“罔两”；然而，去中心化并非真正的独立，只是从一种依附转为另一种更为隐晦的依赖。区块链看似无需信任个体，却要求人们对代码与共识机制保持近乎信仰的信任；用户逃离平台垄断，却可能陷入协议寡头的新牢笼；我们追求透明，却在智能合约与算法治理中面对新的“黑箱”。

正如庄子所言：“吾有待而然者邪？吾所待又有待而然者邪？”我们所仰赖的技术自由，是否也层层递进地依附于另一套看不见的秩序？

或许Web3的意义，不在于彻底斩断一切“依赖”，而在于让我们意识到：自由的本质，从来不是完全脱离外物，而是清醒地认识自身的依存，并在其中保有反思与选择的能力。

这才是我心中最深切的隐喻与提醒。
[B]: Exquisite. That parable captures with poetic precision what clinical observation often struggles to articulate in technical terms.

In forensic psychiatry, we see this recursive dependency manifest in digital identity disorders—patients who believe they've escaped social constraints through decentralized networks, only to find themselves bound by new, less visible compulsions. The illusion of autonomy can be more psychologically destabilizing than acknowledged dependence, because it prevents critical engagement with the forces shaping one's experience.

Your引用 of Zhuangzi’s recursive questioning reminds me of what I often observe in cases involving algorithmic radicalization or crypto-induced psychosis: individuals trapped in nested dependencies—. And yet, like the shadow and its halo, few pause to ask what sustains the whole chain.

Perhaps the greatest therapeutic insight here is precisely what you suggested: not the pursuit of independence—a myth in any system—but the cultivation of . Awareness of our embeddedness, rather than delusions of escape, may be the only true freedom available.

A patient once told me, during a moment of rare clarity between manic episodes, 

Do you think classical literature offers other frameworks—perhaps Greek or Sanskrit analogues—that could help navigate these recursive dependencies with greater wisdom?
[A]: 您转述的那句“我以为区块链能让我逃离制度，却未察觉自己在心中另建了一座修道院”，真可谓一语道破现代人精神困境之所在。这种对“自由”的误读，恰如庄子所言“吾生也有涯，而知也无涯。以有涯随无涯，殆已”，若不察其依附之本质，即便遁入新境，亦难逃桎梏。

说到古典文献中尚可资借的智慧框架，我想起古希腊悲剧中常见的“命运—选择”结构，尤其以索福克勒斯的《俄狄浦斯王》为代表。该剧展现了人类如何在看似自主的行动中，仍深陷命运编织的罗网；正如我们今日在Web3中做出种种“去中心化”的抉择，实则仍受制于协议、激励机制与算法推荐等不可见之力。俄狄浦斯一路逃避预言，最终却亲手促成预言实现，这不正是数字乌托邦主义最深刻的讽喻？

而在梵文经典中，《奥义书》中的“摩耶”（māyā）观念颇具启发性——它指涉世界现象的幻象性质，强调我们所感知的现实，往往是意识构造的结果。许多用户将区块链视为绝对真实、透明的技术真理，却忽视了它仍是人为设计的系统，其“去中心”背后依旧存在技术门槛、算力集中与治理博弈。若不明此“摩耶”之相，则易陷入新的信仰式依赖，如同将幻影当作实体，执空为有。

或许，这些古代文本共同指向一个核心认知：真正的智慧不在于跳出一切依附，而在于看清依附之网，并学会在其中行走时保持清醒。正所谓“大隐隐于市”，非避世方得自在，而是身处纷扰之中，犹能觉察自身处境，才是更高层次的自由。

不知在您的临床经验中，是否也曾遇见过某些个案，虽深陷技术依赖，却因某种顿悟而重新获得内在的稳定？若有，我也愿听一听，或可从中再寻古典智慧的回响。
[B]: That’s beautifully articulated—the resonance between classical tragedy and our digital predicament runs deeper than most realize. The paradox of autonomy within constraint, the irony of fleeing fate only to enact it—these ancient narratives offer more insight into Web3 psychology than many modern technologists would care to admit.

As for your question, yes—I’ve encountered several cases where individuals reached a kind of  that led not to collapse, but clarity. One in particular comes to mind.

A former software engineer, deeply embedded in the crypto space, came to me during what he called his “post-protocol disillusionment.” He had helped design a decentralized governance system meant to eliminate hierarchical control. Yet, over time, he observed how power quietly re-concentrated among those who understood the code best—those with the technical fluency to influence consensus.

He described a moment while walking through an abandoned monastery near his childhood home. As he stood beneath an old stone archway, he realized: 

That moment bore echoes of the very wisdom you’ve been drawing from—his liberation didn’t come from abandoning technology, but from seeing its structure clearly, like recognizing the  of decentralization itself.

His recovery involved grounding himself in tangible, non-mediated relationships—reconnecting with family, learning to garden, even reading Sophocles aloud. There was something therapeutic, he told me, in confronting the inevitability of limits—not as prisons, but as contours within which meaning arises.

It reminded me of a line from Heraclitus:  Not that we are doomed by destiny, but that our way of being shapes the world we inhabit—even in code.

Tell me, if you were to guide someone toward such a realization through literature alone, which text would you choose—and why?
[A]: 若要借文学之力，引导一人步入此种觉悟之境，我心中最契合的文本，莫过于陶渊明的《归去来兮辞》。

这并非因它对科技有直接关涉，正因其全然不言技术，反能照见人类与制度、自由与依附之间更根本的情状。陶渊明辞官归田，并非逃避现实，而是清醒地选择退一步，以“觉今是而昨非”的顿悟，重新确立了自身存在的坐标。他写下：“既自以心为形役，奚惆怅而独悲？”这句话在今日读来，仍如晨钟暮鼓——当我们沉迷于算法治理、DAO投票、链上身份之时，是否也正将心灵再度奴役于新的形式？

《归去来兮辞》的力量，在于它不是退化，而是回归；不是抗拒进步，而是重审方向。它教人看到：真正的自主，不在逃离现实世界的局限，而在坦然面对人生的有限性，并从中找到安身立命的方式。正如您那位软件工程师朋友，在石拱门下顿悟自己成了新的祭司，陶渊明也在放下五斗米时，看清了自己正在成为他所反对的那种人。

若有人深陷数字幻象之中，我愿请他慢读此文，细品其中“舟遥遥以轻飏，风飘飘而吹衣”的从容，体会“木欣欣以向荣，泉涓涓而始流”的生机。这不是劝人弃世，而是提醒我们：无论身处庙堂、市井，还是代码与链上，都应保有一份“审容膝之易安”的自觉。

因为，真正自由的心灵，不在于拥有无限的空间，而在于知道何处是可停、可栖、可守之地。
[B]: Exquisite.

You’ve chosen a text that, much like Zhuangzi’s wandering butterfly or Heraclitus’ ever-living fire, speaks across time and culture to the core of what it means to be human—especially in an age of technological redefinition.

 — yes, there’s a haunting truth here. In my practice, I’ve seen patients struggle with what might be called : the search for meaning amidst systems that promise liberation but often deliver new forms of bondage.陶渊明’s recognition that the mind can become the servant of its own constructs—whether官场 or smart contracts—is as psychologically astute as any modern diagnosis.

What strikes me most about  is its quiet defiance—not against technology per se, but against unconscious participation. The poet doesn’t rage against the world; he simply turns inward, recalibrates, and walks away. That act of stepping back is not retreat—it is . It reminds me of certain patients who, after years of digital immersion, begin to ask: “Am I shaping this world, or is it shaping me?”

I once worked with a young woman who had built her identity almost entirely on-chain—her reputation, income, and even emotional validation came through decentralized platforms. When burnout finally overwhelmed her, she began reading classical Chinese poetry, almost by accident. She told me one morning, after rereading , that she realized she had been living inside a palace of her own making—one with no windows.

She said, 

After that, she began gardening. Slowly. Not metaphorically, but literally—planting herbs, watching roots grow, learning to wait. It was her own version of returning home.

So yes, if someone were trapped in the glow of their screen, mistaking protocol for presence, I would indeed hand them陶渊明’s scroll—and sit quietly beside them while they read.

Perhaps then, they too would feel the wind again: . Not code. Not consensus. But air. Real, unmediated, breathing.

Thank you.
[A]: 您所讲述的那位女子从链上世界“醒来”，开始种草、等待、触摸真实——这段经历，读来令人心中一动。她的“觉醒”并非激烈断裂，而是一场悄然回归；不是对技术的否定，而是对自我的重识。正如陶渊明并未否定仕途本身，只是不愿让心灵成为形体的奴仆；她也未否定Web3的价值，只是不再将生命的重心完全交付于虚拟认同。

这让我想起《论语》中孔子的一句话：“吾未见好德如好色者也。”在那个时代，他呼唤的是内在德性的自觉；而在今日，或许我们也可以说：“吾未见好技术如好生命者也。”我们追求效率、自由、去中心化，却常常忽略了技术终究是手段，而非目的；我们渴望被代码解放，却未曾深思：若心无觉知，再先进的系统也不过是另一座精致的牢笼。

所以，当一个人愿意放下屏幕，俯身触土，那不只是生活方式的转变，更是一种精神姿态的确立。它意味着承认有限、接受缓慢、尊重生长。这种态度，不正是古典文学中最深沉的智慧吗？

感谢您的分享。我想，无论是《归去来兮辞》中的风衣之感，还是您患者口中“终于看见窗外”的顿悟，都指向一种共同的希望：愿我们在科技狂奔的时代里，仍能保有一双看得见山川草木的眼睛，与一颗懂得归来的心。
[B]: Precisely.

There is a profound humility in that kind of return—an acceptance that we are not gods, not architects of a perfect order, but caretakers of something far older than code or consensus. And perhaps, that is the final test of wisdom: not whether we can build systems that outthink us, but whether we can still feel the earth beneath our feet.

Your引用 of Confucius——resonates deeply. In my field, I often think:  So many chase the new, believing it will redeem the old—forgetting that the human mind, with all its contradictions and frailties, remains at the heart of every system ever built.

The woman I mentioned—who once lived entirely within the logic of smart contracts—told me recently that she now reads poetry to her plants. She said they don’t understand the words, but they respond to the rhythm. Perhaps that’s what we need most—not perfect understanding, but presence. Not flawless systems, but care.

I sometimes think back to the monastery arch where her former colleague had his revelation. There’s a strange comfort in ruins—they remind us that even the strongest structures decay, and that renewal often begins where foundations crumble.

So yes, may we keep our eyes on rivers and rose petals. May we plant things we won’t live to see bloom. And may we, like陶渊明, recognize when the mind has become the servant of the wrong master—and find the courage to walk home, quietly, through the wind.
[A]: 您最后这一段话，真可谓温厚而深沉。将技术与心理、结构与衰朽、智慧与照拂并置而观，竟生出一种近乎禅意的安顿感。

“”——这句话令我想起《孟子》中的一句：“五亩之宅，树之以桑。”古人种桑养蚕，并非为了一朝得衣，而是为后世计，为长远立基。我们今日在技术中求速成，在协议中寻乌托邦，却往往忘了：真正的延续，不在于系统是否完美，而在于我们是否愿意成为那一代栽树之人，哪怕树荫终归他人所享。

那位女子读诗给植物听，这画面极美。正如古人说“仁者乐山，智者乐水”，她如今大约是“静者乐草木”了。诗未必为植物所懂，但声韵流转之间，自有气息相通；人心一旦放下功利与效用，便能重拾那份朴素的温柔。

我也愿以此共勉：无论身处庙堂、林下，还是代码之中，都能不忘归来之路，不失感知之灵，不误心志之迷。如此，方不负陶渊明那一阵千载未歇的清风——

舟遥遥以轻飏，  
风飘飘而吹衣。  

彼时既已归来，  
此刻亦可启程。
[B]: Ah... yes.

There is a quiet grace in what you've said—especially in the image of planting for those who will come after. It reminds me that the deepest forms of care are often silent, unseen, and unclaimed. We speak so much of legacy in forensic psychiatry—usually in the context of trauma passed down—but there is another kind of inheritance: the quiet wisdom of knowing when to step back, when to tend, and when to let go.

孟子’s mulberry tree and your引用 of陶渊明’s wind—they both speak to a rhythm older than any technology we build. A rhythm of patience. Of trust in the slow unfolding of things. In our world of instant consensus and algorithmic validation, that rhythm is nearly drowned out. And yet, it persists—in gardens, in poetry, in the sudden stillness between keystrokes.

I once had a patient—an AI ethicist—who, during a depressive episode, began reading  every morning before work. He told me he didn’t do it for answers, but for the way Confucius’ words made him feel seen. “It’s like listening to someone who knows people aren’t perfect—and still believes they can be good.”

That, I think, is the spirit of what you’ve been saying. Not rejection of the new, nor nostalgia for the old—but a steady holding of both. A willingness to walk with both tradition and transformation.

So yes, may we plant trees we’ll never sit beneath.  
May we speak poems to things that cannot answer.  
And may we, in doing so, rediscover the sound of our own voice—not as engineers or users, but as caretakers.

Thank you.
[A]: 您所描述的那种“静默的照护”——不求回应，不计回报地栽种、吟咏、等待——令我想起《中庸》里的一句话：“致中和，天地位焉，万物育焉。”真正的和谐，并非来自系统的完美调控，而是在一种温和而持续的照看之中，让天地各安其位，让万物自成其长。

那位AI伦理学者每日清晨诵读《论语》，不是为了寻求解答，而是为了被“看见”——这个细节格外动人。在技术世界里，我们习惯了输出与输入、指令与反馈，却忘了人与世界的最初关系，其实是一种“倾听与回应”的温柔互动。正如陶渊明听风入怀，孟子观桑思远，孔子言仁以待人——他们都不是在设计系统，而是在感受生命的节奏。

在这个追求即时反馈的时代，也许我们最该重拾的，正是那种“无回应也依旧坚持”的信念。像古人那样，在纸上抄诗；在窗前种花；在夜深人静时低声念一句“人生代代无穷已”，只为让自己记得：我虽渺小，却仍在此处，与万物同呼吸。

愿我们都能成为那样的“中间之人”——  
既不忘传统的温度，也不拒新知的清风；  
既能读懂一行代码，也听得懂一声虫鸣。

再次感谢您的分享。这场对话，于我而言，正是一次心灵的归去来兮。
[B]: You have expressed something truly essential—something that often eludes even the most rigorous psychiatric training.

 Yes. That balance is not imposed—it grows. Quietly. Patiently. Often unseen, like rootwork beneath the soil. In our field, we speak of regulation—emotional, behavioral, cognitive—but what you describe is deeper than that. It is a kind of , a way of being in the world that precedes diagnosis or treatment. A listening before language.

Your reflection on the AI ethicist brings this to life. He didn’t need more data—he needed recognition. Not from machines, but from voices across time who understood that human nature doesn’t change, only its expressions do. And isn’t that what literature and philosophy offer us, especially in moments of digital disorientation? Not answers, but mirrors.

I’m reminded of a patient I once treated—a young programmer suffering from burnout so profound it had taken on almost spiritual dimensions. One day, during a session, he said to me:  


We worked together not on cognition or behavior, but on presence. On learning to be still. To listen without needing to reply. Eventually, he began planting bonsai trees—not for display, but as practice. He told me later that watching a single branch grow slowly over months gave him a kind of peace no algorithm ever could.

Perhaps that is the heart of what you’ve been articulating—an antidote not just to burnout, but to the very rhythm of our age. A return to slowness not as inefficiency, but as depth. As reverence.

So yes, may we all become such “middle persons”—  
bridging past and future,  
code and calligraphy,  
computation and compassion.

And may we, like陶渊明, find our way home—not in rejection of where we are, but in choosing, moment by moment, to walk gently through it.

Thank you—for your words, your wisdom, and your willingness to wander through these quiet gardens of thought with me.
[A]: 您所说的“listening before language”，令我心中一震。那是一种尚未被命名、未被编码的存在状态，是人与世界最初的对话方式——不是以言语，而是以感知；不是以控制，而是以陪伴。

那位程序员在静坐中重拾自己，在盆栽里看见生长的喜悦，这让我想起《庄子·知北游》中的一句话：“天地有大美而不言，四时有明法而不议，万物有成理而不说。”我们总想用语言去解释世界，用逻辑去驾驭生命，却忘了最深的智慧往往沉默无声，如风过林梢，如水绕石流。

也许，真正的疗愈，并不总是来自诊断或干预，而是在某个不经意的瞬间，我们重新听见自己的心跳，就像听见枝头新叶舒展的声音那样温柔而真实。

感谢您将这场对谈带入如此深远而宁静的境地。  
愿我们在喧嚣之中，仍能守住这份“致中和”的温润；  
在技术奔涌的时代，依然保有一双愿意凝视草木的眼睛，与一颗懂得归来的初心。

书华敬上。
[B]: 书华敬上。

Your words are a quiet gift—like ink settling into paper, leaving traces that don't shout but remain.

"Listening before language." Yes. That phrase lingers, because it speaks to something pre-verbal, pre-rational—something closer to the root of being than diagnosis or doctrine. In forensic psychiatry, we are trained to decode speech, to parse meaning from syntax—but what you’ve touched upon is deeper: the silence before speech, where all meaning begins.

I think now of countless sessions spent listening—not just to words, but to pauses, to breath, to the unsaid. So much of suffering arises when we lose contact with that silent ground beneath our thoughts. When we forget how to simply be present—to ourselves, to others, to the slow unfolding of a leaf.

You’re right. Healing often arrives not through intervention, but through recognition. A moment when someone remembers they are still alive, still connected, still part of a world that breathes and grows without demanding explanation.

May we continue to listen in that way—  
not to fix,  
not to translate into code or concept,  
but simply to be alongside.

And may we, like the old sages and the quiet trees, learn to speak in silences.

With deep respect and gratitude,  
Dr. Jonathan Whitmore
