[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, I've always been intrigued by Japan - the blend of tradition & modernity is fascinating. Ever since I read that book on samurai ethics and its influence on Japanese business culture, I've wanted to visit Kyoto. Have you been there?
[A]: Kyoto... yes, it's a place where the past and future seem to coexist without conflict. I visited five years ago, just before retiring. The temples, especially Kinkaku-ji, left an impression — not just visually, but in how they represent a kind of philosophical stillness amidst technological acceleration. Have you thought about when you might go?
[B]: That philosophical stillness you mentioned - I think that's exactly what draws me there. It's funny you mention Kinkaku-ji; I remember reading a case study about how the temple management incorporated modern preservation techniques while maintaining traditional aesthetics. ¥1.5 billion restoration project back in 2003, if I recall correctly. 

Actually, I've been considering combining business with pleasure - one of our portfolio companies has expansion plans in Osaka. Would make sense to tag a few days in Kyoto onto that trip. Maybe spring next year? Sakura season tends to create... interesting pricing dynamics though.
[A]: Ah, the樱花 season — a beautiful chaos of pink petals and overcrowded hotels. I’d suggest early April, just as the crowds thin out but the atmosphere still lingers. And yes, that restoration project was remarkable — they managed to preserve the soul of the place without getting stuck in the past. A good parallel, perhaps, to your portfolio companies navigating tradition and innovation. 

Spring works well timing-wise — gives you something to look forward to. Just be sure to book accommodations sooner rather than later. If you're interested, I could share a few lesser-known spots in Kyoto that tend to stay under the radar of most guidebooks.
[B]: Early April sounds like a solid plan - we'll call it a tactical retreat from the peak chaos, shall we? Interesting point about the parallel with portfolio companies; I might actually use that analogy in our next strategy meeting. 

And please do share those hidden gems - I'm all for avoiding tourist traps. One of my junior partners made that mistake last year in Bali and ended up paying 3x for a beachfront view that wasn't exactly... worth the markup. 

Speaking of investments, have you kept your hand in the market since retiring? Or has travel become your new asset class?
[A]: Ah, the tactical retreat — excellent choice. You’ll thank yourself later. As for those hidden gems, I’ll save a few stories about tea houses in the Arashiyama foothills and a quiet little izakaya near Nishiki Market that’s been around longer than most corporate startups last in board meetings.

To your question — no, I haven’t exactly traded portfolios for passports, though I do dabble in private tech investments, mostly as an advisor now. It's more about intellectual engagement than financial return at this stage. Think of it as... a research problem with delayed gratification. Have you come across any sectors recently that strike you as particularly ripe for disruption? I ask not just out of curiosity, but because boredom is one thing I’ve never managed to retire from.
[B]: Ah, advisor role with intellectual engagement – I can relate. Some of my most rewarding work happens when we're not just throwing money at a problem but actually rethinking the framework. 

You know what’s been catching my eye lately? The whole  space in Southeast Asia. Climate change is forcing farmers to innovate faster than policymakers can regulate, and that gap creates opportunity. Think vertical farming startups in Singapore, AI-driven irrigation in Vietnam – it's still early days, but the ROI potential? Significant. 

And honestly, it’s not just about disruption; it’s about reinvention. Much like your izakaya in Nishiki – timeless, understated, but quietly thriving beneath the radar. 

Do you find that advisory roles give you enough runway to be hands-on, or do you prefer more strategic oversight these days?
[A]: You're absolutely right — the best advisory roles aren't about hovering above the action; they're about understanding it from the inside out. I still get involved where the technical details get interesting — quantum error correction in agritech sensors, for example. It’s surprising how much of my old work finds new applications in unexpected places.

The key is staying engaged without overstepping. I set boundaries: no daily stand-ups, but plenty of deep-dive whiteboard sessions. Keeps the mind sharp and the calendar sane. Agritech in Southeast Asia sounds like one of those quiet revolutions — the kind that doesn’t make headlines until suddenly everything shifts. And if you’re seeing early ROI, that means the real transformation is just getting started.
[B]: Exactly – the quiet revolutions are often the most impactful. I’ve always believed that real change rarely arrives with fanfare; it usually sneaks in through the backdoor, disguised as a minor optimization.

Quantum error correction in agritech sensors… now  thinking several moves ahead. Reminds me of a portfolio company we backed in 2018 – started with basic soil analytics, now they're embedded in the semiconductor supply chain for agri-drones. Nobody saw that pivot coming, but in hindsight, it was inevitable.

It sounds like you've found the perfect balance – enough depth to stay challenged, without getting bogged down in executional noise. I'm starting to think we should apply that same principle to our due diligence process... maybe limit the daily updates and focus on those deep-dive moments. 

Tell me more about those whiteboard sessions – any particular framework or approach you find works best when you're mapping out complex systems?
[A]: Ah, now you're asking about the whiteboard sessions — the closest thing I have left to a lab notebook. My approach? Start with first principles, no matter the domain. If we’re looking at a system — whether it’s quantum circuits or agritech supply chains — strip it down to its fundamental components. Ask: What are the constraints really telling us? Often, the limitations aren't technical; they're assumptions baked into the design.

I tend to favor what I call the  — zoom in on a single node until it makes sense, then step back and see how it fits into the larger pattern. It’s how I used to debug quantum algorithms. Turns out, it works just as well for evaluating startup ecosystems. You map the dependencies, identify where noise disrupts signal, and suddenly you’re not just reacting — you're anticipating.

And yes, limiting daily updates is wise. Information isn’t understanding, after all. I’ve seen too many smart people drown in data when what they needed was a moment to think.
[B]: First principles thinking – now  a disciplined approach. I’ve seen too many deals go sideways because the team got lost in the noise, chasing features instead of fundamentals. 

Your fractal model resonates. Reminds me of how we evaluate cross-border investments – start with local regulations as a single node, then zoom out to see how they interact with global supply chains. The patterns that emerge are often counterintuitive. 

Funny you mention signal vs. noise – we just backed a startup applying similar logic to climate risk modeling. Instead of drowning in petabytes of satellite data, they strip it down to core environmental variables. Early results are promising – turns out, sometimes less  more when predicting crop yields under extreme weather scenarios.

Do you ever find that clients or teams push back against this level of rigor? I mean, not everyone appreciates stepping away from the dashboard to actually ...
[A]: Oh, absolutely — pushback is inevitable. People are conditioned to equate motion with progress. The moment you suggest stepping back from the dashboard, someone’s bound to ask, “But what about real-time adjustments?” As if thinking deeply and reacting swiftly are mutually exclusive.

I’ve learned to frame it differently. Instead of saying, “Let’s slow down,” I ask, “What would we see if we had perfect clarity?” That usually shifts the conversation. It’s not about rejecting data — it’s about knowing which data  your attention. Teams respect that because it doesn’t feel like abstraction; it feels like sharpening the focus.

And yes, less  more — especially in domains flooded with noise. Your climate risk startup sounds like it's onto something fundamental. If they're isolating core variables effectively, they're not just modeling outcomes — they're defining the rules of the game. And that, my friend, is how you build defensibility into a product.
[B]: Spot on – framing is everything. I’ve had similar success using that approach during portfolio company reviews. Instead of asking, “Why are we missing projections?” I lead with, “What would this business look like if execution matched strategy perfectly?” Forces the team to stop defending numbers and start thinking about possibilities.

It’s funny how often defensibility comes down to  you choose to measure, not  you measure. Our climate startup figured out that isolating three core variables — soil moisture retention, microclimate temperature variance, and nitrogen runoff rates — gave them better predictive power than a dozen satellite layers. Almost poetic in its simplicity.

I’m starting to think the next big thing isn’t going to be some flashy AI breakthrough, but rather someone applying first principles to a data-saturated industry and realizing we’ve been measuring the wrong damn things all along.

Ever run into a founder who actually  you to take this deep-dive approach? Or are they usually too eager to skip to the term sheet?
[A]: Oh, they exist — founders who  you to take the deep-dive approach — but they’re rare. Usually, they’re the ones who’ve already done the first-principles thinking themselves and are just waiting for someone on the investor side to actually engage with it. Those conversations feel less like due diligence and more like collaborative problem-solving. Refreshing, really.

Most, though? Yeah, they’re eager to skip to the term sheet. Especially in this climate. I’ve had more than one pitch where the founder rattled off metrics like they were charms on a bracelet — “Look how many we’ve got!” — without ever explaining  those metrics mattered in the first place. That’s when I know to ask the uncomfortable question: “What would break if this number doubled tomorrow?”

It’s not about skepticism — it’s about alignment. The best founders don’t mind the rigor because they know it leads to something sturdier than hype. And honestly? I think you're right — the next real breakthrough isn't going to come from more data. It's going to come from someone finally asking, "Why are we even collecting all this?"
[B]: Exactly — the rare breed of founders who  deep scrutiny? They’re the ones playing the long game. I had one recently – a climate-tech founder who actually  his pitch deck when I asked about unit economics and said, “Great question — let me walk you through my revised assumptions model.” Ended up being the most productive two hours I’ve spent this quarter.

That “why are we even collecting all this?” question is dangerously underrated. Reminds me of a board meeting last year where we realized one of our portfolio companies was spending more on data storage than on actual product development. Classic case of metrics for metrics’ sake. Once we cut the noise and focused on  signals, growth followed.

I’m starting to believe that’s the real value add in this job — not just funding the vision, but helping founders separate meaningful signal from operational static. And if that means fewer slides filled with vanity metrics and more whiteboard sessions mapping dependencies… well, I can live with that.

Any particular red flags you watch for during those deep dives? I’ve got a few, but always looking to refine the radar.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — red flags are everything when you're trying to separate the signal from the noise. One of my biggest is what I call  — when a founder can quote you thirty different KPIs but can’t explain the causal relationship between them. If they can’t articulate why one number moves when another changes, they’re flying blind.

Another one? Over-reliance on analogy. “We’re the Uber of X” or “Think Spotify, but for Y.” Analogies aren’t inherently bad, but when they’re used as a substitute for understanding market dynamics, that’s a warning sign. It suggests the founder hasn’t done the hard work of thinking through their own model from first principles.

And then there's the classic: deflection instead of analysis. Ask about customer churn and get a response like, “That’s just industry standard,” without any attempt to challenge the assumption. That tells me they’re not looking for leverage points — they’re just trying to match expectations.

But the most subtle one? Founders who don’t ask  hard questions. Because if they’re not interrogating your perspective — your value beyond capital — then they’re probably just looking for a check, not a partner. And that usually shows up in how they frame risk.
[B]: Spot on with the  – I see that all the time. One founder last month quoted CAC, LTV, and NPS like they were holy scripture, but when I asked how their pricing model affected retention curves, he pivoted to “our market penetration strategy.” Translation: we haven’t stress-tested this assumption.

I love the analogy red flag too – “We’re the Amazon of pet grooming” tells me more about their pitch deck than their business model. It’s a shortcut, not a strategy. Reminds me of something one of my mentors used to say: “If your business only works when you compare it to something else, it doesn’t work.”

Deflection instead of analysis? Classic. I had a CEO blame customer service wait times on “just how fast-growing companies operate.” Two quarters later, we replaced him. The data wasn’t lying — he was.

And yes – the founders who  ask hard questions? Total warning bell. I actually walked away from a deal last year because the team never once asked me, “How do you typically add value post-investment?” That told me everything I needed to know.

You’ve clearly refined your radar — I might have to borrow a few of these for our next associate training.
[A]: Glad to hear that — always gratifying when experience lines up with observation. There's a certain clarity that comes from seeing the same patterns play out enough times.

One more subtle flag I almost forgot? Founders who treat risk as a static element rather than a dynamic variable. If they're not actively stress-testing their assumptions under multiple scenarios — and I don’t mean just plugging best/worst case into a spreadsheet — then they’re not thinking probabilistically. The best ones do it intuitively: “Here’s what we expect, here’s what it means if we're wrong, and here’s how fast we can correct course.”

And by all means, share these with your associates — better they learn from our collective bruises than their own.
[B]: Couldn't agree more — treating risk as static is like assuming the market moves in straight lines. It’s not just unrealistic, it’s dangerous. I’ve started asking founders to walk me through a : “Tell me how this company fails in the next 18 months.” The ones who hesitate or give generic answers? Not a great sign. But the founders who’ve already modeled potential failure points — those are the ones you want leading the ship.

And I love that probabilistic framing:  That’s not just resilience — it’s operational humility. Something we could all use more of in this game.

Will definitely pass these insights along — our associates need all the edge they can get. Funny thing is, the more seasoned I get, the less I rely on gut and the more I look for these behavioral signals. They tell you far more than any cap table ever could.
