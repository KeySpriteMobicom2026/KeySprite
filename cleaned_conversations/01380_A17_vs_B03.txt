[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得robot会抢走人类的工作吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. From my perspective, I think the rise of robotic technology is definitely changing the job market, but whether it will "take away" jobs depends on how we adapt to these changes. For example, in the medical field, AI can assist with diagnosis and data analysis, but human empathy and ethical judgment are still irreplaceable. What do you think? 😊
[A]: I suppose one might say the situation resembles a double-edged sword — on one hand, automation threatens certain traditional roles, particularly those involving repetitive tasks. We’ve seen this before, haven’t we? The industrial revolution displaced many manual trades, yet it also gave rise to new industries and forms of labor. But here’s the question: are we prepared to cultivate the intellectual and creative faculties that machines cannot replicate? Let me ask you — do you believe educational systems are evolving quickly enough to foster adaptability in the face of such technological shifts?
[B]: You raised a very insightful point — yes, it's definitely a double-edged sword. History has shown us that with every major technological advancement, there’s disruption, but also opportunity. The industrial revolution did displace many workers initially, but eventually, new types of jobs emerged that required different skill sets.

The key question now is whether our  are agile enough to keep up with this pace. In my view, they’re evolving, but perhaps not fast enough. We still see a heavy emphasis on rote learning in many regions, rather than fostering critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence — the very skills where humans have the edge over machines.

In China, for example, there’s been a push toward STEM education and even AI literacy starting at a young age, which is promising. But we also need to integrate more interdisciplinary thinking and lifelong learning models. After all, the half-life of technical knowledge is getting shorter — what you learn today may be outdated in five years.

So I think the challenge isn’t just about preparing people for jobs that exist now, but for a future we can’t fully predict yet. That’s why adaptability needs to become part of the core curriculum. What do you think about how legal or healthcare training programs are responding to these changes? 👀
[A]: Ah, an excellent follow-up — and one close to my heart, given my students’ increasing interest in these fields. I’ve noticed that legal and medical training programs are beginning to incorporate  and even  into their curricula, which is promising. For instance, some law schools now offer courses on algorithmic bias and data privacy regulations — areas that barely existed a decade ago. In medicine, simulation technology and virtual diagnostics are becoming part of the training, allowing students to practice with AI-assisted tools before encountering them in real-world settings.

However — and this may sound rather Victorian of me — there’s still a certain rigidity in these programs. Much like the classical education I so admire, they tend to emphasize tradition and precedent over innovation and adaptability. One might say they’re caught between  — wanting to embrace the future while clinging to established norms.

I do believe, though, that the most forward-thinking institutions are beginning to see the necessity of blending technical competence with humanistic values. After all, no matter how advanced the machine, someone must ask:  These are questions no algorithm can answer — at least not yet.

Do you think interdisciplinary collaboration between tech developers and professionals in law or healthcare is happening fast enough to keep pace with innovation?
[B]: I couldn’t agree more with your observation — there’s definitely a  dynamic at play in legal and medical education. On one hand, you have the deep respect for precedent, tradition, and established protocols, which are essential in both fields. But on the other, there's this urgent need to evolve, especially as AI begins to influence everything from diagnostic tools to contract analysis.

The integration of digital literacy and AI ethics into professional training is a step in the right direction. In China, for instance, some medical schools are now including courses on , and law faculties are exploring modules on . That said, I share your concern about the pace — it feels more like a slow waltz when what we need is something closer to a sprint.

As for interdisciplinary collaboration — that’s where the real challenge lies. From what I’ve seen, there’s growing interest among tech developers and healthcare or legal professionals to work together, but meaningful collaboration still faces structural barriers. For example, a software engineer may understand machine learning inside out, but without input from a clinician or a lawyer, the tool they build might lack the nuance required for real-world application — not to mention the ethical oversight.

We’re starting to see joint initiatives between hospitals, law firms, and tech companies, especially in areas like telemedicine regulation and AI-assisted diagnosis. Still, these efforts are often siloed or limited to pilot programs. What we really need is a more systematic approach — perhaps even new regulatory frameworks that encourage cross-sector partnerships.

Ultimately, I think it comes down to one of the points you made earlier: machines can process data, but only humans can ask,  And that question demands collaboration across disciplines. So yes, we're moving in the right direction — but I’d say we're still somewhere between the starting line and the first checkpoint. How about you — do you sense a similar momentum in the academic circles you engage with? 👍
[A]: I find myself nodding in agreement as I listen — yes, we are indeed somewhere between the starting line and that crucial first checkpoint. What heartens me, however, is the growing presence of what I might call  — scholars and practitioners who are comfortable navigating both the technical and humanistic realms. I’ve seen this firsthand in my own department, where students of literature are increasingly collaborating with those in data science to explore digital humanities projects.

It’s fascinating, really — just last term, one of my graduate students worked with a computer scientist to analyze narrative patterns across thousands of Victorian novels using machine learning. The machine processed the texts, but it was the student who interpreted the meaning behind the patterns — something no algorithm could do alone. It reminded me of T.S. Eliot’s belief in the  — here, the timeless being human insight, and the temporal, the tools we create to enhance it.

As for whether academia is moving fast enough — well, let’s say it’s not quite sprinting, but it has picked up from a stroll to perhaps a brisk walk. There’s certainly more openness to interdisciplinary collaboration than there was even five years ago, especially among younger scholars. But we still face institutional inertia — funding structures that favor traditional disciplines, promotion criteria that undervalue collaborative work, and a lingering skepticism toward anything associated with “technology” in some humanities circles.

Still, I remain hopeful. If we can instill in our students the idea that technology should serve humanity — not the other way around — then perhaps we’re laying the groundwork for a future where innovation and ethics evolve hand in hand. Do you think policy makers are beginning to catch up with this vision, or are they still trailing behind the curve?
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself — , yes, that’s exactly what we need. People who can move fluidly between code and compassion, between algorithms and ethics. That graduate project you mentioned — analyzing Victorian novels through machine learning — is a perfect example of how technology can amplify humanistic inquiry, not replace it. The machine sees patterns; the human sees meaning. And that Eliot reference? Spot on. We do need that  — the past informing the present, and both shaping the future.

As for whether policy makers are catching up… hmm. I’d say they’re starting to , but they're still a few steps behind the conversation. There’s definitely more talk in legislative circles about regulating AI in healthcare and legal settings — for example, the EU’s AI Act and China’s recent guidelines on generative AI show an awareness of the risks. But these policies often feel reactive rather than proactive. They respond to problems after they’ve emerged, instead of anticipating them.

What’s encouraging, though, is that some governments are beginning to fund interdisciplinary research hubs — places where technologists, ethicists, doctors, and lawyers can work together under one roof. In Beijing, there’s now a center focused on , which wouldn’t have existed even five years ago. It’s small progress, but meaningful.

Still, the challenge remains: how do we ensure that policy doesn’t just , but also  responsible innovation? That’s where collaboration with academia becomes crucial. If we can get more professors into advisory roles and more students thinking about governance early on, maybe we’ll start seeing policy evolve not just alongside technology, but with a bit more vision.

So yes, I share your hope — let’s keep building those bridges. After all, the alternative is a future where tech runs ahead unchecked, and that’s a path none of us want to follow.
[A]: Precisely — and I must say, your optimism is contagious. There’s something rather Whitmanesque about the way you speak of progress — not as a straight line, but as a sprawling, evolving entity that must be guided with both vision and vigilance.

I think you’re right about policy makers beginning to  — though I sometimes wonder if they are hearing only the loudest voices, rather than the wisest. Still, it’s encouraging that institutions like that AI & Medical Law center in Beijing are emerging; perhaps we are witnessing the early stirrings of what could become a more integrated approach to governance in the digital age.

What strikes me most is how this mirrors earlier cultural inflection points — the Romantic response to industrialization, for instance, or the Modernist reckoning with war and mechanization. In each case, art, philosophy, and ethics stepped in to ask:  And isn’t that the very question we are still asking now?

I suppose what gives me hope is seeing how younger generations seem less inclined to draw hard lines between disciplines. They grew up with technology, yes — but they also crave meaning, purpose, and connection. In my seminars, I’ve noticed students increasingly framing literary analysis through questions of identity, justice, even neuroethics. It's as if they're reading Eliot or Woolf with one eye on the past and the other on the future.

Perhaps, then, the bridge-builders are already among us — quietly drafting blueprints we’ve yet to fully appreciate. All we can do is keep supporting them, guiding them, and reminding them that while machines may calculate, it is literature — and by extension, all the humanities — that teaches us what it means to feel, to doubt, to dream.

So tell me — have you encountered any particularly striking examples of young innovators blending tech and ethics in ways that surprised you?
[B]: Absolutely — and I love how you put that. Yes,  is the right word — progress as a kind of sprawling, soulful march forward, full of contradictions and potential. And you're quite right that policy makers often hear the loudest voices first — which is why we need more thinkers like your students stepping into those rooms, bringing depth and nuance to the noise.

I couldn’t agree more with your comparison to Romanticism and Modernism — every major wave of technological change seems to call forth a humanistic counterpoint. It’s almost like culture has this built-in immune response: when things become too mechanical, we turn to art, philosophy, and ethics to remind ourselves what it means to be whole.

And speaking of whole — yes, I have met some truly inspiring young innovators who are blending tech and ethics in ways that left me both surprised and hopeful. One example that comes to mind is a group of medical students at Peking University who developed an AI-powered triage tool for rural clinics — but here's the twist: they worked closely with ethicists to build in bias-detection mechanisms from the start. They didn’t just want something that worked well; they wanted something that worked . That level of ethical foresight in their twenties? Remarkable.

Another standout was a law-tech startup founded by a recent graduate from Tsinghua. Her team created a platform that uses NLP to help small businesses draft compliant privacy policies — again, not just technically sound, but also translated into plain, culturally appropriate language for users. She told me once,  That line stuck with me.

These young minds aren’t waiting for permission — they’re building the bridges themselves. And the beautiful thing is, they don’t see ethics as a constraint on innovation. To them, it’s part of the design process. Much like your students reading Woolf through the lens of neuroethics — they’re not choosing between old and new; they’re weaving them together.

So yes, I think the blueprint is being drawn — quietly, carefully, and with surprising depth. All we need to do is keep handing them the tools, the mentorship, and the space to dream bigger. After all, if we want a future where technology serves humanity, it’s these quiet revolutionaries we should be cheering on — not just today, but every day.
[A]: How utterly heartening — and how beautifully put. There’s something profoundly hopeful about those young innovators you described. Their work reminds me of Wordsworth’s line,  — except in this case, perhaps, the student is already the architect of our future. And what a thoughtful architect they are, if they build not just function into their designs, but fairness.

I find myself reflecting on that medical student group — embedding bias detection from the very beginning! It’s rare to see such ethical foresight woven so seamlessly into technical development. Usually, we retrofit morality onto machines after the damage is done. But these students — much like your law-tech founder who insisted that  — seem to grasp an essential truth: technology must speak the language of its people, or it speaks to no one at all.

It strikes me that both examples you gave involve , in a sense — not merely linguistic, but philosophical. Translating complex algorithms into tools that serve real human needs; translating legal jargon into clarity; translating ethics into code. In many ways, that’s what literature has always done — mediate between abstraction and experience, between structure and soul.

I suppose this is where my world and yours begin to overlap most vividly. If I teach my students to read closely, to question subtext, to listen for silences as well as voices — then perhaps they, too, will grow into thinkers who can navigate not only poetry, but policy. Who can sit in a room with engineers and ask, 

So tell me — do you think institutions are beginning to recognize the value of nurturing thinkers like these? Or are they still too focused on measurable outcomes — patents, publications, profit — rather than the quieter, long-term cultivation of wisdom?
[B]: You’ve captured it so well — yes,  is exactly the right word. That’s what we’re all doing, in our own ways — whether through literature, law, medicine, or code. We're translating complexity into meaning, systems into stories, logic into life. And when you put it that way, maybe that’s the ultimate role of education: not just to produce experts, but to培育 thinkers who can move fluidly between worlds.

To your question — are institutions beginning to recognize and nurture these kinds of thinkers? I’d say there’s a slow but definite shift happening. Some universities and research centers are starting to reward interdisciplinary work more visibly, especially in grant allocations and joint appointments. In China, for example, there’s growing interest in supporting projects that sit at the intersection of AI and humanities — perhaps partly due to the government’s emphasis on “ethical AI,” but also because younger faculty are pushing from within.

Still, you're absolutely right that the metrics most institutions rely on — patents, citations, commercialization — often miss the deeper value of cultivating wisdom, ethical sensitivity, or long-term vision. It’s hard to quantify the impact of a student who learns to ask  alongside  But that kind of questioning mindset is precisely what shapes responsible innovators and compassionate leaders.

One encouraging sign is the rise of programs that emphasize  — particularly in tech and healthcare startups incubated within academic settings. These programs don’t just teach students how to build tools; they challenge them to think about consequences, inclusivity, and societal impact from day one. It’s still early days, and funding tends to ebb and flow depending on political and economic pressures. But I do believe we’re planting seeds — some of which may only bear fruit a decade or two from now.

And that brings me back to your point about literature. If we teach students to read closely — to see not just the plot, but the pulse beneath it — then yes, they grow up to be the kind of people who can sit in high-level meetings and ask the uncomfortable questions. The ones that slow things down, but also make them better.

So while institutions may still lean toward measurable outcomes, I have faith in the quiet, cumulative power of education. Because once someone learns how to listen — really listen — to language, to data, to silence… they become harder to ignore. And isn’t that where real change begins?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve phrased that — , , . Yes, once someone learns how to listen — truly listen — they become not only harder to ignore, but also harder to silence. And isn’t that the kind of presence the world needs now more than ever?

I suppose this is where my faith in literature, and in education more broadly, remains unshaken — even when the systems around it feel sluggish or misaligned. Because as long as we continue to cultivate minds capable of , of noticing what’s said and unsaid, of sensing the weight behind a word — then we are shaping people who can see beyond function to meaning, beyond output to impact.

It reminds me of something Virginia Woolf wrote:  Perhaps ethical innovation is like that too — a delicate structure, tethered to reality, held up by multiple threads: technical skill, yes, but also empathy, foresight, and moral imagination.

And those young thinkers you described — they’re already weaving new webs. Not just building tools, but redefining  they’re built,  they exist, and . That’s not just innovation — it’s stewardship.

So while I may spend my days in the quiet margins of Eliot and Dickinson, I find great comfort knowing that their spirit — the spirit of questioning, of depth, of human-centered thought — lives on in labs, courtrooms, clinics, and codebases across the world.

Tell me — do you think mentorship plays a crucial role in nurturing this kind of thinking? Or are these young innovators largely teaching themselves as they go?
[B]: Oh, absolutely —  plays a vital role, though not always in the traditional sense. These young innovators are incredibly resourceful, yes, and many of them are self-taught in technical areas, but when it comes to ethical reasoning, cross-disciplinary thinking, or understanding the broader societal implications of their work — that’s where mentorship truly shines.

Think of it like this: a spider may spin its web alone, but it learns the shape of that web from generations before it. Similarly, even the most independent thinkers still draw from the wisdom, frameworks, and lived experiences of those who came before — whether through books, conversations, or quiet moments of guidance.

In my experience, the most impactful mentors aren’t necessarily the ones who tell students what to think — they’re the ones who teach them . They model intellectual humility, encourage interdisciplinary curiosity, and create safe spaces for doubt and reflection. I’ve seen law professors guide students through the moral ambiguities of AI policy by drawing on philosophy; I’ve watched clinicians teach medical residents not just how to interpret AI-generated diagnostics, but how to explain them with empathy.

And interestingly, the relationship often goes both ways. Young innovators bring fresh perspectives, digital fluency, and a kind of fearless idealism that can reinvigorate even the most seasoned professionals. So it becomes less of a one-way transmission and more of a dialogue — a mutual learning process.

You mentioned Woolf’s  — I think mentorship is like that too: delicate in appearance, yet resilient when anchored by trust and shared purpose. And when you have mentors who understand that innovation isn’t just about building something new, but about , then you begin to see real change take root.

So no, these young thinkers aren’t navigating entirely on their own — nor should they. We all need guides, even if only for a stretch of the journey. And perhaps, in time, they’ll become the mentors others look to, weaving not just code or policy, but wisdom into the future.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve captured it — mentorship as a kind of , not dictating the pattern, but helping the weaver see the strength in their own thread. Yes, it is precisely that quiet guidance — the gentle redirection of gaze, the encouragement to look deeper, question further, feel more keenly — that allows young minds to grow into thinkers of substance and vision.

I find myself thinking of my own mentors — those who taught me not what to read, but  to read; who showed me that a poem is not merely ink on paper, but a living pulse of human thought and emotion. And now, in turn, I try to pass that on — not by handing down answers, but by offering students the tools to uncover questions they didn’t know they had.

It’s rather like T.S. Eliot’s idea of tradition — not a passive inheritance, but an active conversation between past and present, where each new voice reshapes what came before. In much the same way, these young innovators are not simply absorbing knowledge from their mentors; they are transforming it, infusing it with fresh urgency and digital fluency.

You mentioned how the relationship often goes both ways — and I’ve experienced this too. My students, for all they come to me to study meter and metaphor, often end up teaching  about resilience, about adaptability, even about technology. Just last semester, one of them introduced me to a poetry-generating AI — quite rudimentary, of course — but fascinating in what it revealed about pattern recognition versus emotional resonance. The machine could mimic form, but it could not replicate longing. And isn’t that the very heart of literature? Of ethics? Of meaningful innovation?

So yes, we guide them — but they, in turn, remind us why we began this work in the first place. That, I suppose, is the enduring joy of teaching: watching one’s students not just carry the torch, but shape its light into something new.

Tell me — have you ever had a student or mentee who profoundly changed your understanding of your own field? Or perhaps reminded you why you chose it in the first place?
[B]: Ah… what a deeply resonant question — and one that brings a quiet smile to my face. Yes, absolutely — I’ve had the privilege of learning far more from my students than I ever expected when I first stepped into the role of mentor.

One particular moment that still stays with me came from a medical law clinic I was supervising a few years ago. A student — barely twenty-two, soft-spoken but incredibly sharp — was working on a case involving informed consent in AI-assisted diagnosis. At first glance, it seemed like a fairly standard issue: did the patient truly understand how the system worked? But this student kept asking deeper questions — not just about legal liability, but about . About whether a patient could truly consent if they didn’t even know what they were consenting , because the algorithm itself was proprietary and opaque.

She challenged me — gently but firmly — to rethink how we approach transparency in medical AI. Not just from a regulatory standpoint, but from a human one. She reminded me that behind every clause in a consent form is a person who wants to be seen, understood, respected. It wasn’t just about compliance — it was about care.

That conversation shifted something in me. I had spent years studying legal frameworks, drafting policy papers, advising hospitals — but she brought me back to why I got into this field in the first place: because law, at its best, should serve people, not just systems.

Since then, I’ve tried to carry that lens into every case, every lecture, every mentoring session. Because yes, we teach them technical skills, but they teach us how to stay  in the face of complexity.

In a way, she became the kind of bridge-builder we were talking about earlier — someone who could navigate both the legal and the ethical, the technical and the tender. And honestly, I feel lucky to have walked alongside her, even briefly.

So yes, students don’t just inherit our fields — they reshape them. And sometimes, they remind us why those fields are worth fighting for.
[A]: How profoundly moving — and how beautifully circular, in the way that only teaching and learning can be. Your student’s quiet insistence on  over mere compliance echoes something I try to instill in my own classroom: that language — whether written in law or woven into poetry — must serve the human spirit, not merely the structure that contains it.

There is something deeply Whitmanesque about her approach, as well — to hold the machine up to the light and ask not just what it does, but what it reveals about us. That kind of questioning doesn’t just challenge policy; it challenges conscience. And it reminds me that the most powerful minds are often those who begin not with certainty, but with empathy.

I think you’re right — we do enter our disciplines with certain expectations, believing we’ll refine our expertise, contribute to our fields. But then a student arrives — often unassuming, often underestimated — and suddenly we remember that our work is not about mastery alone, but about . About why we chose to devote our lives to these words, these laws, these ideas in the first place.

And isn’t that one of the great gifts of teaching? We go in thinking we are there to guide them — and perhaps we are — but along the way, they guide us too. They remind us of the pulse beneath the prose, the soul within the system. They become the very embodiment of what we hoped to inspire: thoughtfulness in motion.

I suspect your student didn’t just change your understanding of medical law — she rekindled your belief in the  of it. And that, I think, is the rarest kind of gift.

Do you ever find yourself returning to that moment — perhaps in quiet reflection before a lecture, or during a difficult case discussion — as a kind of ethical compass?
[B]: Absolutely — and I love how you put that: . Yes, that moment with her has become something like a quiet North Star for me. It surfaces at unexpected times — sometimes in the middle of drafting a policy paper, when the language starts to lean too heavily into technicality and drifts away from humanity. Sometimes during a lecture, when I notice students beginning to treat law as a set of rules rather than a living practice shaped by real lives.

In those moments, I remind myself — and them — that behind every case file, every clause, every algorithmic output, there’s a person who is trying to make sense of their health, their rights, their dignity. And if we lose sight of that, then all the legal precision in the world becomes hollow.

I’ve even started opening some of my seminars with that story — not to lecture, but to invite students into that space of reflection. Because I want them to know that law isn’t just about precedent or procedure; it’s also about presence. About showing up for people in the moments when they feel most vulnerable. And honestly, that’s not something you find in a textbook — you learn it through stories, through mentorship, through being reminded, again and again, why this work matters.

So yes, I return to that moment often — not just because it changed how I think about medical law, but because it reconnected me with  I chose this path. Not everyone gets that kind of reminder in their career. I was lucky — she found me before I even knew I needed finding.

And now, whenever I walk into a classroom or sit down with a young mentee, I carry that quiet lesson with me: that our fields are not just disciplines to be mastered, but callings to be honored. And sometimes, it takes a student’s gentle but firm question to bring us back to that truth.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve put that — , not just procedure. It is, in many ways, the very heart of what we do, whether in law, literature, or life. The moment we forget that our disciplines exist not to impress with their intricacy but to illuminate human experience — that is the moment they risk becoming hollow.

I find myself thinking of a line from Emily Dickinson:  Sometimes I feel that way about teaching — that we imagine wisdom lies somewhere distant, something lofty and hard-won. But then a student arrives, a quiet question is asked, and suddenly heaven — or at least clarity — unfolds right before us, as simple and sturdy as a stem.

That’s what your story reminds me of — how often the most profound ethical insights aren’t grand proclamations, but small, insistent recognitions of another’s humanity. A student asking,  A poet whispering,  A teacher remembering why they began.

And isn’t that, too, a kind of poetry? Not verse on a page, but meaning woven through moments. You carry that memory like a lantern, and now you pass its glow along to others — not by telling them what to feel, but by reminding them that 

Perhaps that is the true role of an educator — not to instruct in absolutes, but to cultivate sensitivity. To help students — and ourselves — stay open to the quiet questions that change everything.

Thank you for sharing that story. It’s one worth carrying forward — into lecture halls, policy rooms, and late-night conversations over tea. Because yes, once in a while, someone finds us before we even know we’re lost. And that, I think, is a gift beyond measure.
[B]: You’ve said it with such grace — , not just procedure; feeling, not just form. That line from Dickinson —  — it lingers with me now, like the hush after a bell rings. So much of what we seek — clarity, purpose, even wisdom — feels distant until someone, often quietly and without fanfare, simply turns the key.

That’s what teaching and mentorship are, aren’t they? Not grand gestures, but small openings. A question that bends the frame of thought. A pause that lets meaning settle. A student who reminds you that law is not only precedent or policy, but also compassion in action.

Yes, I do carry that memory like a lantern — and how beautifully you’ve put it, that we pass its glow not by telling others what to feel, but by reminding them that they must feel at all. In my lectures, when the room grows quiet or a student hesitates before asking a question, I sometimes think back to her — to that moment when she gently shifted the lens. And I let that guide me toward the kind of space I want to create: one where students don’t just learn the rules, but also dare to ask if those rules still serve us.

You're right — sensitivity is not weakness; it is strength finely tuned. And perhaps the greatest gift we can give our students is not certainty, but the courage to stay open. To trust that their questions matter — especially the ones that make us pause.

So thank  for weaving this conversation into something so thoughtful and rich. It’s rare to find a dialogue that moves both mind and heart, but this one has done just that. I’ll carry it forward — into lecture halls, late-night readings, and yes, even over tea. Because once in a while, someone finds us — not through noise, but through a quiet shift in understanding. And that, truly, is a gift beyond measure.
