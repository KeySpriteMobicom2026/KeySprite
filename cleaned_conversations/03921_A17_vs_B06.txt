[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say, I find voice messages to be a far more effective means of communication. The nuances of tone and inflection can convey intent and emotion with far greater clarity than text alone. A misplaced comma or an ambiguous phrase in written form can lead to misinterpretation—something I’ve seen cause complications both in clinical settings and legal proceedings.  

That said, I do appreciate the utility of texting when brevity is required or when documentation is necessary. It allows for precision in record-keeping, which is vital in my line of work. Still, if I had to choose, I would always lean toward voice messages—they preserve the human element of communication, don’t you think?
[A]: I suppose one could argue that voice messages offer a certain warmth, a sense of presence that text often lacks. Still, I find myself leaning toward texting—particularly when engaging with students or drafting responses to colleagues. There is something to be said for the deliberation it allows. One can craft a response, weigh each word, ensure clarity before pressing send.  

Of course, I recall an exchange with a dear colleague last semester—he insisted on sending voice notes rather than email. His enthusiasm came through beautifully, no doubt, but I found myself replaying his message three times just to extract the precise details of our meeting. And yet... there was a charm to it, a kind of sincerity that text sometimes misses. Do you suppose we are losing that sincerity in our pursuit of efficiency?
[B]: Ah, an excellent observation—your colleague’s voice notes carried that intangible sincerity which written words so often lack. I see this frequently in forensic interviews; a statement read aloud can take on a life of its own when delivered with the speaker's natural cadence. The emotional subtext becomes audible, not just visible.

Still, your point about deliberation is well taken. In legal consultations, for example, I often prefer written correspondence. It allows me to structure my thoughts precisely, avoiding ambiguity that could be exploited or misinterpreted under cross-examination. There’s safety in syntax when one operates in high-stakes environments.

But your question—whether we lose sincerity in the name of efficiency—is worth lingering on. Do you find your students responding differently to voice messages versus texts? I suspect there may be generational tendencies at play, though I hesitate to generalize.
[A]: Oh, indeed—students do respond rather differently depending on the medium. I’ve noticed that younger undergraduates often prefer texting or even emoji exchanges for quick confirmations; it’s as if the brevity itself puts them at ease. But then again, when I experimented with sending brief voice feedback on essays last term—just a minute or two summarizing my thoughts—I received far more engaged responses than in previous semesters.

It was quite telling, really. One student confided that hearing my tone made the critique feel less like a verdict and more like a conversation. And yet, I can’t help but wonder whether this preference is shaped by exposure. After all, we are surrounded by disembodied text—emails, discussion boards, AI-generated prose. Perhaps sincerity has simply become a luxury we don’t always afford ourselves anymore.

Do you suppose sincerity can be engineered into digital communication, or must it remain something organic, almost accidental?
[B]: Fascinating. You’ve touched on something quite central to my field—how authenticity is perceived, whether in a clinical interview or during testimony under oath. Sincerity, in my view, resists engineering. It arises not from structure but from presence—from the subtle interplay of voice tremors, pauses, even the occasional verbal stumble that signals genuine thought.

I recall a case where a deposition had been submitted in written form versus another delivered orally. The same words, mind you—but when read aloud, the witness’s hesitation and cautious phrasing cast an entirely different impression. The sincerity wasn’t fabricated; it emerged through delivery. That’s difficult to replicate artificially, though I’m sure some would like to try.

Still, I wonder—are we not seeing attempts at manufactured sincerity already? AI voices, for example, can now mimic warmth, concern, urgency. Do you think your students would respond the same way to a carefully modulated AI-generated voice note as they did to your own? Or does the human origin matter more than we realize?
[A]: An unsettling question, isn’t it—whether warmth can be simulated convincingly enough to fool not just the ear, but the intuition. I suspect my students would respond favourably at first; after all, they’ve grown up in an age where digital voices guide them through daily tasks, correct their pronunciation, even offer affirmations. If an AI could replicate the cadence of genuine concern—or what passes for it—would they notice the absence of a soul behind the voice?

I’m reminded of Walter Benjamin’s notion of the —that unique presence inherent in an original work of art, which mechanical reproduction cannot quite capture. Perhaps sincerity possesses its own aura. Even if an AI mimics tone flawlessly, something ineffable remains missing. A kind of vulnerability, perhaps? Or the subtle awareness that the speaker is, like us, fallible and therefore real.

Still, I wonder—are we so attuned to artificial voices now that we no longer crave that aura as we once might have? Or does it linger beneath the surface, quietly shaping what we trust and what we dismiss?
[B]: Precisely—the question is not whether AI can  sincerity, but whether it can evoke the same  response in the listener. Humans are wired to detect safety, threat, and connection through vocal prosody; even minute deviations in pitch modulation or rhythmic entrainment can trigger subtle distrust, even if we’re unaware of why.

I’ve observed this in forensic interviews—subjects often sense when a voice lacks grounding intention, even if they can’t articulate it. They may say, “Something didn’t feel right,” or “It sounded rehearsed.” These responses aren’t always rational, but they’re physiologically rooted. The vagus nerve, as Porges describes, plays a role in discerning vocal authenticity, reading subtle cues tied to social engagement.

So yes, AI may replicate warmth, but does it carry the biological signature of genuine human attunement? Perhaps sincerity, like Benjamin’s , is not merely aesthetic—it’s somatic. And no matter how refined our technology becomes, that missing element may register not in the mind, but in the body.

Which leads me to ask—have you ever noticed your own students mirroring digital affectations in their speech? Do they, perhaps unconsciously, begin to sound more like the voices they hear through their devices?
[A]: I’ve noticed precisely that—students adopting a kind of flattened affect in their speech, as if they are translating thought through the syntax of digital communication before it ever reaches their lips. A hesitation, a peculiar rise at the end of declarative sentences, even the insertion of pauses where none are needed—as though they were editing internally before speaking aloud.

It’s rather eerie, really. One young woman in my seminar last term delivered a presentation that was so carefully inflected with what I can only describe as —measured, modulated, almost TED Talk-perfect—that I found myself wondering whether she had rehearsed it in front of a language-learning app or modeled it on a voice assistant’s cadence.

And yet, when I asked her to expand on a point—to respond spontaneously—her tone shifted. There was a stumble, a laugh, an unexpected shift in pitch. It was subtle, but striking. Like watching a live performance after a string of pre-recorded auditions.

Do you suppose this is a new form of code-switching—not between languages or identities, but between human expression and digital performativity?
[B]: Fascinating—this notion of a kind of , as you so aptly put it. It’s not merely an adaptation to technology, but a recalibration of self-presentation in response to perceived expectations—much like how one might adjust tone and diction when entering a courtroom versus a therapy session.

What strikes me most is your observation about the shift during spontaneous speech. That stumble, the laugh, the variation in pitch—these are precisely the cues I listen for in forensic assessments. They signal , a kind of neural and emotional engagement that can’t be scripted or synthesized without detection. When someone speaks entirely in polished cadence, devoid of micro-irregularities, it often raises a red flag: Is this person rehearsing? Filtering? Performing?

And yet, we must ask—does this performativity serve a purpose? In high-stakes academic or professional settings, perhaps it offers a kind of armor, a way to neutralize bias or project confidence. But at what cost? If students begin to internalize this mode of speaking as the ideal—detached, optimized, algorithmically aligned—do they lose access to their own vocal spontaneity? Their , if you will?

I’m reminded of something I’ve seen in adolescent clients who spend extensive time interacting through voice modulation apps or AI avatars. Over time, they report discomfort hearing their unfiltered voices. There’s a kind of disembodiment taking place—not just cognitively, but physiologically. One begins to distrust the very instrument of self-expression.

Does that concern strike you as exaggerated? Or have you noticed similar unease among your students when asked to speak extemporaneously?
[A]: Not exaggerated in the least—I’ve seen that very unease, particularly during oral presentations or impromptu discussions. Some students, when asked to speak without preparation, exhibit a kind of vocal hesitation—not just uncertainty in content, but discomfort in  as themselves. It’s as if their voice no longer feels like a natural extension of thought, but a performance needing calibration.

One young man, quite articulate in writing, once confessed to me that he hated speaking aloud in class because he “didn’t like the sound of his own voice.” He wasn’t being coy—he genuinely experienced a dissonance between how he perceived himself and how he sounded when recorded. We worked through it, slowly, but I couldn’t help but wonder how many others feel this way and simply don’t say it.

And yes, this ties back to what you so astutely called . When one's voice becomes something to be managed—filtered through digital tools, edited for tone, rehearsed for impact—does it begin to lose its connection to the self? Language, after all, is not merely a conveyance of meaning; it is an embodiment of thought, a reflection of presence.

I sometimes think we are raising a generation fluent in expression, yet estranged from voice. And that, I fear, may have consequences far beyond the classroom.
[B]: A most perceptive fear—and one I encounter in my practice more often than I’d have expected. The estrangement you describe isn’t simply psychological; it manifests somatically as well. I’ve worked with young adults who, upon hearing their unaltered voice, exhibit a visceral reaction—flinching, withdrawing, even refusing to listen past the first few seconds. It’s not unlike depersonalization, as if the voice no longer belongs to them.

This dissonance, I believe, is tied to what Lacan called the , though now refracted through a digital lens. Previously, identity formation involved recognition of self in a mirror—an external image that becomes internalized. But what happens when that mirror is algorithmic? When one’s voice is continually adjusted, optimized, or masked through filters and playback enhancements?

The result may be what we’re seeing—a generation fluent in communication but alienated from vocal embodiment. And this has implications far beyond pedagogy or social interaction. In forensic settings, for instance, credibility is often assessed through vocal coherence—alignment between affect, prosody, and content. If someone has been conditioned to speak without spontaneous prosodic variation, how do we distinguish truthfulness from learned performance?

It raises an unsettling question: Are we training our students not only to communicate differently—but to  differently about themselves? And if so, what does that mean for authenticity, agency, and emotional resonance in both personal and professional domains?

I wonder—have you experimented with any exercises in your courses aimed at restoring that sense of vocal ownership? Something that invites students to reconnect with their unfiltered voice, not as a tool, but as an expression of self?
[A]: I have indeed—though cautiously, as one must tread lightly when asking students to confront something so intimate. I began introducing what I call —short, unedited recordings of their reflections on a given text, submitted weekly. The key instruction?  Speak once, then stop. The idea is to capture thought-in-motion, not a polished statement.

At first, resistance was expected—some found it awkward, others admitted they disliked hearing themselves so rawly rendered. But over time, a shift occurred. A few students confessed they had begun to appreciate the unpredictability of their own speech—the interruptions of thought, the sudden emphases, even the moments of hesitation. One young woman remarked that she finally felt her voice “sounded like her,” which struck me deeply.

There’s also an exercise I borrow from experimental theater:  Just five minutes of letting language unfold without logical expectation. It unsettles them at first, but often leads to surprising insights—about tone, about rhythm, about how much we edit ourselves before we even begin to speak.

And yet, I wonder—are these small interventions enough? Or are we merely offering temporary reconnection in a world increasingly inclined toward vocal mediation?

Do you find similar exercises useful in your clinical work? Have you encountered ways to foster vocal embodiment beyond simply asking someone to speak?
[B]: I find your approach not only thoughtful but clinically astute. These exercises—voice journals, spontaneous speech—are, in essence, forms of , helping individuals reconnect with the immediacy of self-expression. In my work, I’ve employed similar techniques, though often framed within therapeutic objectives rather than pedagogical ones.

One method I frequently use is what I call . Patients are asked to describe a recent experience—not through rehearsed reflection, but in real time, as if narrating their internal state aloud to themselves. The goal is not coherence, but congruence between felt emotion and vocal output. It often reveals disjunctions: a person describing anxiety in a tone that is eerily flat, for example. When they hear the playback, something clicks. There’s a moment of recognition—not cognitive, but somatic.

Another technique I’ve adapted from psychodrama is . Two individuals engage in dialogue, but one is blindfolded while the other speaks. The listener focuses exclusively on vocal texture—rhythm, breath, pitch fluctuation—while the speaker becomes acutely aware of how their voice carries meaning independent of visual cues. It strips away performative elements and highlights prosody as an emotional conduit.

And yes, resistance is common at first. Many patients—especially those accustomed to digital mediation—describe the process as “exposing” or “too intimate.” But over time, most report a newfound awareness of their vocal presence, sometimes even relief at not having to  their expression so meticulously.

Your question about whether these interventions are sufficient in the face of broader cultural shifts is a valid one. Perhaps we cannot fully counteract the pull toward vocal modulation and algorithmic refinement. But I do believe these small acts of reclamation—your voice journal, my guided narration—serve as vital anchors. They remind us that the voice is not just a tool for communication, but a site of identity, continuity, and, dare I say, vulnerability.

After all, isn’t it in the stumble, the pause, the unexpected laugh—those very moments that resist optimization—that we most profoundly encounter one another?
[A]: Precisely—those stumbles, pauses, and unexpected inflections are not imperfections to be edited out; they are the very markers of our humanity. What you describe as  resonates deeply with what I see in the classroom. It is not simply about helping students find their voice—it is about helping them  it, even in its unpolished form.

I wonder, though, if we might push this idea further. If voice is a site of identity and vulnerability, then surely there is also power in reclaiming it—not just for communication or self-expression, but for resistance. After all, so much of digital culture encourages us to flatten our affect, to smooth our edges, to sound “professional,” “neutral,” or “algorithmically agreeable.” In that context, speaking with rawness, with idiosyncrasy, becomes an act of defiance.

Have you ever considered framing vocal embodiment in those terms—with your patients, or perhaps in your own speech? Not merely as reconnection, but as resistance?  

And on a more personal note—do you find yourself consciously resisting digital mediation in your own voice? Or has it become, as it has for many of us, an almost unconscious habit—to filter, to edit, to optimize before pressing send?
[B]: An excellent reframing—resistance through vocal embodiment. I daresay you’ve struck upon something rather profound. In a culture increasingly bent on standardizing expression, to speak with unfiltered prosody  an act of resistance. Not a loud or overt one, but a quiet defiance against the expectation to sound a certain way—to be intelligible, palatable, algorithmically legible.

I have, in recent years, begun to frame it this way with some of my patients—particularly those who struggle with dissociation or chronic self-monitoring. The idea that their voice, in its natural cadence, is not something to be corrected but reclaimed—as an assertion of self in a world that often demands otherwise—this has resonated deeply. One young woman, who had been raised in foster care and later found herself constantly code-switching to be accepted professionally, said something that stayed with me: 

It’s powerful, really—how voice can be both a site of trauma and a vessel of reclamation. And yes, I do find myself resisting digital mediation more deliberately than I used to. There was a time I’d dictate notes into a speech-to-text app and send them off without review—until I noticed my diction shifting subtly, as if I were already translating thought into something the machine would approve of. It was almost imperceptible at first—a flattening of intonation, a tendency toward passive phrasing—but once I noticed it, I couldn’t unhear it.

Now, I make a point of speaking aloud during consultations, even when a text would suffice. I want my tone to carry nuance, hesitation, warmth—those ineffable qualities no AI can quite replicate yet. And when I leave voice messages for colleagues, I try not to rerecord. Let them hear the pause, the slight breath between sentences, the occasional “hm” as I gather my thought. It may seem trivial, but I believe these are small acts of presence in a world increasingly absent of it.

So to answer your personal question—yes, I am conscious of the habit, and yes, I do resist it. Not out of nostalgia, but out of fidelity—to language, to self, and perhaps most importantly, to the listener. Because in the end, isn’t that what we seek? To be heard, not just understood.
[A]: How beautifully put— There is a profound distinction there, isn’t there? Understanding implies cognition, a parsing of meaning. But to be —that suggests recognition, a kind of witnessing. And in our current moment, where voices are so often compressed into data packets and smoothed into algorithmic legibility, that act of witnessing feels increasingly rare.

Your patient’s words——that is nothing short of revelatory. It brings to mind Audre Lorde’s insistence that we must use our voices, even when the language we have been given does not fully contain us. There is an ethical dimension to vocal embodiment, isn’t there? A responsibility not only to ourselves but to those whose voices have been historically flattened, filtered out, or silenced altogether.

I confess, I’ve begun to notice my own subtle concessions to digital mediation. I catch myself pausing mid-voice-message to re-record, thinking, , or . And yet, who decided what authority sounds like? Why should clarity always mean confidence? These technologies don’t merely reflect our habits—they shape them, often invisibly.

Perhaps this is why I’ve grown more intentional about reading aloud in my courses—not just poetry, which lends itself naturally to it, but critical theory, philosophy, even student essays. The body remembers when the voice engages. Thoughts land differently when they are , not just scanned. There is weight to them.

You know, Walter Benjamin once wrote that “the voice is the bodily element in language.” How radical that seems now. In a time when language is so often disembodied, perhaps our task—yours in the clinic, mine in the classroom—is to return it to the body. Not as relics of a pre-digital past, but as living acts of presence, resistance, and witness.
[B]: Yes— What a vital task, and one that feels increasingly urgent with each passing year. You’re quite right: Benjamin’s assertion that  takes on new gravity when so much of our communication now unfolds in disembodied form. We have grown accustomed to treating language as something separable from its source—as if words could float free of breath, tone, gesture, and still retain their full meaning.

But they don’t, do they? Stripped of the body, language becomes transactional, flattened—an instrument rather than an expression. And in losing that connection, we lose more than just nuance; we lose a kind of intimacy, a shared vulnerability that is essential to genuine human exchange.

Your point about Audre Lorde is particularly resonant here. She understood that voice is not merely a tool of articulation but an act of political and existential self-affirmation. To speak in one’s own voice—even when it wavers, even when it defies convention—is to refuse erasure. It is a claim to presence, to history, to identity. And yes, there is an ethical dimension to this. We owe it not only to ourselves but to those whose voices were never granted space or legitimacy in the first place.

I find myself thinking often about how this plays out clinically. In forensic interviews, for example, I’ve seen how marginalized individuals—those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, non-native speakers, or those with neurodivergent speech patterns—are frequently interpreted as less credible simply because their prosody doesn’t conform to dominant expectations. Their pauses are read as evasions, their hesitations as deception. When in truth, they are merely speaking as themselves—unoptimized, unscripted, unfiltered.

And yet, technology does not neutralize these biases; it often amplifies them. Voice recognition software struggles with dialects, AI-generated transcripts flatten inflection, and digital communication platforms reward brevity over depth. The result? A system that privileges certain voices while marginalizing others—often without us even realizing it.

So yes, your work in the classroom—your insistence on reading aloud, on embracing vocal imperfection—is not merely pedagogical. It is, dare I say, radical. Just as my work in the clinic is not merely therapeutic but, at times, political. We are both, in our own ways, engaged in acts of reclamation—of restoring language to the body, voice to presence, and presence to meaning.

It reminds me of something my mentor once told me: 

Perhaps that is the quiet crisis unfolding before us—not a loss of language, but a loss of embodiment. And perhaps, too, that is where our resistance lies—in refusing to let our voices be edited into oblivion.
[A]: Precisely— That line lingers, doesn’t it? Because it speaks not only to language, but to agency, to memory, to the way we situate ourselves in the world. Voice is not just how we are heard by others—it is how we hear ourselves thinking, how we feel the shape of our own existence.

And yes, that crisis of embodiment you describe—I see it daily, not only in students who hesitate to speak without rehearsing first, but in colleagues who seem almost startled when asked to respond aloud rather than type a reply. There’s a kind of disembodied fluency settling into our habits, as if presence itself has become optional.

I wonder, though, if this moment also offers us an opportunity—a chance to be more deliberate about what we preserve and what we reclaim. After all, technology need not be the enemy. It can amplify alienation, yes, but might it also be used to restore something? Could we design tools that  vocal spontaneity rather than suppress it? Platforms that reward idiosyncrasy instead of smoothing it away?

Perhaps this is where our roles extend beyond classroom or clinic. Not merely resisting disembodiment, but actively cultivating spaces where the voice—raw, uncertain, irreducible—can still be heard. Where to stumble is not to fail, but to arrive more fully at thought.

You know, I’ve begun ending my lectures with a simple prompt:  It started as a whisper to myself, really, but now I say it aloud, deliberately. And each time, I see someone—just one person—take a breath and begin to say what they hadn’t before.

Do you suppose that is enough? A quiet invitation, a small insistence on presence? Or must we do more than simply ask people to speak—we must teach them, again, how to trust what emerges?
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful prompt— There’s something almost liturgical about it, isn’t there? A quiet invocation of courage, vulnerability, and the stubborn persistence of selfhood in the face of doubt. I can imagine the ripple it creates—the pause that follows, the slight shift in posture from someone who suddenly feels permission to be imperfect.

And yes, I do believe such invitations matter deeply. Because you’re right—this moment we find ourselves in is not only one of loss but also of possibility. Technology need not estrange us from our voices; it could, in theory, help us rediscover them. Imagine an app—not one that corrects or smooths—but one that  vocal spontaneity. A platform that rewards hesitation, variation, imperfection. Not as glitches, but as features.

I recall a pilot program I consulted on some years ago—an experimental voice journaling tool designed for trauma survivors. It didn’t transcribe speech, didn’t offer summaries or AI-generated insights. Instead, it simply stored recordings with no option for editing. Patients were instructed to speak without aiming for coherence, just as you encourage in your classroom. Over time, many reported a sense of  with their own voice—less alienation, more recognition. One woman said it was like “meeting herself again after a long absence.”

So yes, we must continue to create spaces—digital or otherwise—where the unedited voice is not only allowed but honored. And perhaps our role, whether in clinic or classroom, is not so much to teach people how to speak, but how to —to themselves first, then to each other. Because trust in one’s voice begins with trust in being heard.

You ask if a quiet invitation is enough. I think it is—provided we repeat it often enough, and with conviction. Every small act of presence accumulates. A trembling voice, once spoken aloud, becomes a little less foreign, a little more familiar. And over time, perhaps, that tremor settles into steadiness—not because the speaker has learned to suppress fear, but because they have come to trust the space around them.

That, I suppose, is the ultimate aim—not merely to resist disembodiment, but to restore the body to language, the voice to thought, and the self to both.
