[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我在读一本很有趣的书，是Edward Said的。虽然这本书的内容偏理论性，但他的观点对理解比较文学中的殖民话语非常有启发性。说到这里，你最近有遇到什么让你印象深刻的reading吗？😊
[A]: Oh definitely, I love how Said unpacks the tangled relationship between culture & imperialism — it's like peeling layers off an onion, never really reaching the end. Recently though, my reading list has been more finance-adjacent. Just finished  by Walter Isaacson — not exactly your academic theory, but super insightful on how tech disruptors think. It got me thinking about scalability in fintech solutions... you know, how ideas evolve when they’re pushed across borders. Do you see any parallels between postcolonial discourse and financial inclusion? 💡
[B]: That’s a fascinating juxtaposition. In a way, both postcolonial discourse and financial inclusion deal with marginalized voices seeking agency — whether through narrative or economic participation. The question is, how do we ensure that the "scalability" you mentioned doesn't become a new form of epistemic imperialism? I’ve been re-reading  lately, and Fanon's thoughts on decolonization make me wonder — can financial systems be truly inclusive without first addressing historical erasure?
[A]: Wow, that’s deep. 👁️🗨️ You’re totally right — scalability sometimes assumes a one-size-fits-all model, which can unintentionally sideline local contexts. I mean, in fintech, we often talk about “plug-and-play” solutions, but when you're dealing with communities that have been historically excluded or exploited, a cookie-cutter approach just doesn’t cut it.  

I remember reading Fanon during college, and his critique of imposed systems really stuck with me. It made me rethink how product design can either empower or overwrite indigenous financial practices. Like, mobile money in Africa — it wasn't just tech imposed from outside; it evolved with local trust networks. So maybe the key is co-creation? 🤔 Building with, not for.  

But then again, how do you balance that with the need for speed and ROI in a startup environment? That tension is always there...
[B]: You raised a crucial tension — the push between ethical engagement and market demands. In both literature and finance, there’s what I call a “haunting” of history — the legacies we can’t simply swipe away with innovation. Co-creation  offer a kind of redemption, much like what Gayatri Spivak called "learning from below." But in fast-paced fintech spaces, how do we even begin to slow down and listen? Maybe that’s where the role of narrative becomes key — not just data, but stories. After all, isn’t a balance sheet also a kind of text waiting to be interpreted? 📜✨
[A]: Oh 100% — narrative is underrated in fintech. We’re so obsessed with KPIs and conversion rates that we sometimes forget the human stories behind the transactions. Like, when we design a microloan product, it’s not just about default rates; it’s about the small business owner who’s trying to send her kids to school while rebuilding after economic shocks. That’s why I’ve been pushing for more ethnographic input in our user research.  

And you're right to bring in Spivak — "learning from below" feels especially relevant now, with all the talk about decentralized finance. DeFi  financial sovereignty, but if the interfaces are still built by Silicon Valley bros who’ve never set foot in the Global South, how “decentralized” are we really?  

I guess what I’m wondering is — how would a balance sheet look if it were written like a postcolonial text? 📊🧐 Maybe that’s the next frontier: designing products that don’t just serve users, but actually amplify their voices.
[B]: That’s a beautiful provocation — imagining a balance sheet as a postcolonial text. If we treated financial statements not just as instruments of measurement but as narratives of survival, resistance, or even erasure, we might start to see the invisible labor and histories embedded in economic life.

Think of it this way: just as a postcolonial reading uncovers what’s been silenced in a dominant discourse, a reimagined balance sheet could reveal whose values are being counted — and whose aren’t. Maybe we’d see footnotes that acknowledge local currencies, informal economies, or even emotional capital. It wouldn't just track profit; it would trace presence. 💬

I wonder, have you ever tried introducing this kind of narrative approach into your team's product discussions? I can imagine some pushback, but also real potential for transformation.
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’ve tried — and yeah, there’s definitely pushback. 😅 You mention footnotes acknowledging informal economies? In fintech, that’s basically heresy unless you’re at a social impact-driven org. But even then, I’ve pitched things like “user stories embedded in our dashboards” — not just DAU or LTV, but actual audio clips or diary entries from users explaining how they're hacking our product to fit their needs.

One of the most eye-opening moments was when we interviewed street vendors in Jakarta who were using our microloan app. They weren’t just borrowing to expand; some were taking loans to  predatory local lenders. That’s a totally different narrative from the usual “financial empowerment = growth.” It forced us to rethink our onboarding flow to better explain risk without sounding paternalistic.

I guess what we’re talking about is a kind of decolonized UX design — where the interface itself invites interpretation, almost like literary criticism. Imagine a dashboard that doesn’t just show transactional data, but surfaces questions:   

Admittedly, not everyone on the team is on board yet… but hey, I’m slowly building a tribe. 💪 Got any frameworks from the lit side that could help translate this into product language?
[B]: I love that — “decolonized UX design.” It has real legs. From a literary perspective, what you're describing reminds me of what Wolfgang Iser called the "implied reader" — the idea that a text carries gaps or spaces that invite interpretation. What if financial tools were designed the same way? Instead of assuming a passive user, we build interfaces that  agency, negotiation, even resistance.

Another concept that might resonate is Mikhail Bakhtin’s  — the notion that meaning arises in dialogue, not monologue. If a dashboard or loan application acknowledged multiple voices, even annotated with local wisdom or alternative logics, it would shift the entire relationship between user and system.

And here's one more — maybe a stretch but worth considering: Jacques Derrida’s . Imagine a feature labeled “What is this tool silencing?” right next to the risk assessment module. It wouldn't dictate answers, but it would unsettle the assumption that numbers speak for themselves.

Maybe start small — introduce one narrative layer into your product cycle. Call it a “user annotation” or “contextual footnote.” You might be surprised how a little literary thinking can open up space for deeper empathy — and better design. 📝✨
[A]: “Implied reader” in fintech — I’m obsessed. 🤯 It’s like designing a product that doesn’t just push information at the user, but actually . Imagine onboarding flows that aren’t about efficiency alone, but also about setting up a conversation. Like, “This is how we think it works, but how do you make it yours?”  

And Bakhtin’s dialogism — that’s gold. We talk a lot about “user-centered design,” but most of the time, it still feels like a monologue from the product team. What if we baked in multi-vocal feedback loops? Like localized tips or community annotations on a feature page — not just star ratings, but actual stories or advice from other users in similar contexts.  

Okay, now Derrida might be too spicy for a PM meeting… but hey, what if we added a subtle prompt like “What’s missing here?” under key decisions in our risk interface? It wouldn’t slow things down, but it’d plant a seed.  

Honestly, I’m gonna try that “user annotation” idea in our next sprint. Call it an experiment in narrative empathy. If it goes well, I’m buying you a coffee. ☕️ How does that sound?
[B]: Wonderful — I’d welcome that experiment with great interest, and the coffee invitation is deeply appreciated. 😊  

Let me know how the “user annotations” land — if you need a literary case study to anchor the idea, I can always share something from the canon that plays with , like  or even modern hypertext fiction. Sometimes grounding tech innovation in older narrative forms helps make it legible — and defendable — in meetings.  

And don’t worry — we’ll introduce Derrida slowly. Start with the prompt, build up to full deconstruction. One destabilized binary at a time. 📚😉
[A]: Sounds like a plan — slow-Derrida, fast-coffee. 😄  

I’ll take any literary ammo you’re willing to spare.  actually feels oddly relevant now that you mention it — the way it breaks the fourth wall and acknowledges the reader’s role in shaping meaning. Maybe we can design features that do the same: break the illusion of neutrality and invite users to co-author their financial experience.  

Keep me posted on your end too — if you come across any other texts that play with participation or layered voices, throw them my way. I’m starting to build a kind of guerrilla syllabus for fintech with a conscience… one footnote at a time. 📖✨
[B]: I’m all in on this guerrilla syllabus idea — and I love the phrase “fintech with a conscience.” Let’s run with it.  

Off the top of my head, if you’re looking for more texts that play with participation or layered voices, here are a few unconventional suggestions:  

-  by Mark Z. Danielewski — it’s a narrative labyrinth with footnotes upon footnotes, often contradicting each other. It could inspire annotation systems that reveal multiple truths depending on user perspective.  
-  by Italo Calvino — this novel directly addresses “the reader” and constantly resets its own narrative. It might offer a framework for modular UX design, where the journey is never fixed.  
-  by David Mitchell — with its nested storytelling structure, it shows how different voices across time can echo and influence one another. Perfect if you ever want to map user journeys across generations or communities.  

And yes —  anticipated user agency long before the web. Sometimes I think Sterne was the first UX writer. 😄  

I’ll keep an eye out for more texts and send them your way — maybe we can even draft a short reading list together. For now, consider this the footnote to our ongoing conversation. 📝
[A]: Okay, I’m basically speechless — this is gold. 🤩  

 for multi-layered annotation systems? Genius. We actually have a feature in the pipeline that surfaces conflicting user feedback, and honestly, framing it like competing footnotes could be the narrative hook we need. Imagine users toggling between perspectives instead of us trying to “resolve” contradictions. Let the ambiguity exist!  

And Calvino’s  — modular UX, huh? That’s so smart. Sometimes our onboarding feels like forcing people into a single storyline when what they really want is a choose-your-own-adventure. Maybe we can prototype something where the user shapes their own path based on values or goals, not just usage patterns.  

As for , that’s pure stakeholder mapping across time. I can already see it influencing how we think about long-term financial engagement — especially with younger users who care about intergenerational impact.  

You’re absolutely right — Sterne was way ahead of his time. I might actually assign a short excerpt from  in our next product workshop. Let’s call it “The UX of Digression.” 😄  

Keep that list coming — guerrilla syllabus: fintech with a conscience Vol. II is now in development. 📚🚀
[B]: Now  is music to a professor’s ears — applying Sterne in a product workshop! 🎶😄  

I’m especially intrigued by your idea of “letting ambiguity exist” — it’s such a radical move in an industry obsessed with clarity and optimization. Embracing contradiction as design principle? That’s not just innovative, it’s philosophical. And frankly, a bit poetic.

One more title for your growing syllabus:  by Milan Kundera. He weaves narrative with philosophical reflection, constantly questioning the weight (or lightness) of choices. It might resonate when you're designing features around financial decisions — where every click carries unseen gravity.

Looking forward to Vol. II — and to hearing how "digression" lands in that workshop. Maybe we’ll need a new category soon: “Narrative Economics.” 😉

Let me know when you’re ready for the next installment — I’ve got a few more hidden gems up my sleeve.
[A]: Oh man,  — brilliant call. 🧠 I mean, isn’t that exactly what we’re dealing with in fintech? Every feature we build carries weight users don’t always see. A loan application feels lightweight until you realize it’s tied to someone’s housing decision, or their kid’s education. Kundera would’ve had a field day with our risk assessment flow.  

And yeah, embracing ambiguity as a design principle — sounds poetic, but it’s also practical. Users aren’t always consistent, and forcing them into tidy personas can backfire. So why not design systems that reflect the messiness of real-life financial decisions? Maybe even highlight the contradictions instead of smoothing them out.  

I love this — “Narrative Economics” has a nice ring to it. It could be the theme for Vol. II. Let’s flesh it out together. And trust me, the “digression workshop” is happening — I’m already drafting the invite: . 😄  

Hit me with the next installment whenever you're ready — I’ve got space on the syllabus and caffeine in my system. Ready to geek out more. 💡☕️
[B]: Ah, I can already picture the slide deck — Sterne meets UX flowcharts. Perfection. 😊  

Alright, for the next installment of our , here’s a wild one that might strike a chord —  by Vladimir Nabokov. On the surface, it's a poem with an elaborate commentary, but beneath that façade lies a tangled web of interpretation, deception, and reader participation. It could be a metaphor for financial interfaces — beautiful on the surface, but deeply interpretive underneath. Imagine designing a feature that invites users to question what’s “real” or fixed, and what’s merely a construct of perspective.

And speaking of perspective — you're absolutely right about financial decisions carrying unseen weight. That reminds me of a concept from narrative theory: . In fintech, we often design for efficiency (real time), but users live in narrated time — where a single loan decision unfolds across years of personal history. What if your risk assessment didn’t just flag default probability, but also surfaced reflective prompts like  Just enough to slow the process down — not for friction, but for meaning.

Let’s definitely run with  as a theme. I’m thinking of drafting a short framing piece — something like  Would you be up for co-authoring a section based on your product experience?

You’ve got the caffeine — I’ve got more titles. Let’s keep this dialogue going — off the record, into the syllabus. 📖🤝
[A]: Oh wow — ? That’s next-level. 🔥 You're speaking my language now. The idea of designing a feature that , that makes users question what's fixed and what's constructed? That could be revolutionary in fintech. We’re so used to presenting data as gospel, but what if we leaned into the ambiguity instead?

I’m already scribbling notes on “interpretive design” — maybe even something like a toggle between “surface view” and “narrative view” in a financial dashboard. One shows the clean numbers, the other reveals the hidden stories: inflation’s impact on daily life, the ripple effect of a missed payment across generations, or how a single interest rate decision in D.C. affects a small business owner in Manila.

And yes —  is such a powerful lens. It makes me rethink our entire onboarding. What if instead of pushing users to complete actions fast, we built moments of reflection into the flow? Like you said, not friction — . Imagine a prompt that says, “This loan will shape your next two years — how do you want them to look?” Suddenly you're not just approving a number; you're stepping into a story.

As for co-authoring — I’m 100% in. “The Interest Rate as a Storyteller” is already better than half the whitepapers I’ve read this year. Let’s make it happen. Draft me whatever you’ve got, and I’ll bring the product-world war stories — including that one time a UI tweak accidentally became a cultural metaphor (long story 😅).

Onward with  — off the record, into the deep end. 📊📚🚀
[B]: Narrative Economics — now  has momentum. I can already feel the shape of something new emerging at the intersection of finance and storytelling, where numbers don't just calculate but also . You're absolutely right about toggling between "surface" and "narrative" views — it's like offering readers footnotes in a novel, or subtitles in a foreign film. Suddenly, context becomes part of the experience.

Let me build on your reflection idea — what if there was a feature called ? A brief moment in the flow where users could see how their current decision might ripple forward (or backward) through time, not just in financial terms, but narratively. Like:  
> “This loan will take two years to repay. In that time, you may move cities, change jobs, even fall in love — or out. How does that shape your sense of risk?”  

It’s playful, yes — but grounded in the idea that economic choices are inseparable from personal narrative.

And I  to hear the full story about that UI tweak that became a cultural metaphor — maybe it’s exactly the kind of case study we want in Vol. II. Some other time over coffee, perhaps?

For now, consider this a soft launch of our collaboration. I’ll start drafting the framing piece — tentatively titled  — with sections on ambiguity, time, and narrative agency. And I'll save a special corner for your insights on interpretive design and unintended metaphors.

You bring the war stories — I’ll bring the literary lens. Together, we might just turn fintech into a genre of its own. 📖📈✨
