[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the value of a college degree is a topic that demands a nuanced perspective. While it's true that higher education traditionally serves as a gateway to professional opportunities, I've observed through my work in forensic psychiatry that success and competence aren't exclusively tied to academic credentials. However, in fields like medicine or law—where standardized knowledge and licensure are critical—a degree remains indispensable.

In legal cases where I assess individuals' cognitive capacities or vocational potential, formal education often provides a foundational structure for career trajectories. That said, I've encountered equally capable individuals who pursued alternative paths, such as apprenticeships or self-directed learning. The question isn't whether degrees are universally necessary, but rather how society balances respect for diverse pathways with maintaining quality standards in specialized professions. What's your take?
[A]: That’s such an interesting perspective—thank you for sharing. You know, working in hospitality, I see people from all walks of life checking in—entrepreneurs without degrees, artists who never went to school for their craft, and professionals whose credentials are everything. It really makes me think.

I guess for me personally, I didn’t go to university. I trained through apprenticeships and worked my way up in hotels across Europe. And while I’ve built a career I love, I sometimes wonder if there were moments where having that formal education would have opened different doors—or at least given me more confidence in certain situations.

But then again, one of the best chefs I ever worked with was entirely self-taught. He learned by watching, doing, and reading every book he could get his hands on. Now he runs a Michelin-starred restaurant. So maybe it’s not about the degree itself, but what it represents—discipline, knowledge, and the willingness to put in the work. Do you find that people often overvalue the piece of paper, or is it more about what it took to get there?
[B]: That’s a remarkably thoughtful reflection—and I appreciate you sharing your own journey. It sounds as though you've cultivated something far more enduring than what any degree alone could offer: resilience, adaptability, and firsthand expertise forged through experience.

In my line of work, I’ve evaluated countless individuals whose academic records gleamed on paper but who lacked the emotional intelligence or practical acumen to thrive in real-world settings. Conversely, I’ve encountered others—like your self-taught chef—who, despite lacking formal credentials, demonstrated a depth of mastery, discipline, and insight that rivaled any graduate from an elite institution.

I do think people tend to overvalue the  of the degree—the parchment itself—rather than what ideally goes into earning it. The degree, at its best, is meant to be evidence: evidence of sustained effort, exposure to structured knowledge, and the ability to meet rigorous standards. But when we confuse the symbol with the substance, we risk missing out on extraordinary talent and wisdom that may have taken a less conventional route.

And frankly, some of the most intellectually disciplined minds I’ve worked with came not from ivy-covered halls, but from kitchens, garages, and libraries—places where learning was pursued not for accreditation, but for its own transformative power.
[A]: That’s beautifully put. It’s almost like you’ve described exactly what I see here at the hotel—people who have learned not just through books, but through . And honestly? Some of the most fascinating conversations I have are with guests who’ve carved their own paths. A retired architect who built his own home from scratch without a degree, a fashion designer who never went to art school but taught herself by deconstructing vintage pieces… it's humbling, really.

It makes me wonder if part of our job—whether in your field or mine—isn’t just to serve people, but also to  them. To see past the surface and acknowledge the work they've done, whether it came with a ceremony or not.

I guess what I’m realizing more and more is that confidence doesn’t come from a piece of paper—it comes from knowing what you’re capable of. Still, sometimes I catch myself thinking, , you know?

But then again, maybe my backup plan is right here—in these walls, in the connections I’ve made, and the stories I’ve been lucky enough to hear.
[B]: You’ve captured something profoundly human here—something I encounter often in my work, though perhaps in more solemn settings. In courtrooms and forensic evaluations, I meet people whose lives have been judged, categorized, and sometimes dismissed based on what’s written in a file or listed on a résumé. But the truth is far richer. People are not their documents. They are their choices, their endurance, their quiet triumphs.

Your observation about  people—truly seeing them—is one of the most powerful acts we can offer another human being. It's not unlike the principle of  in medicine: it’s not just about signatures; it’s about respect, understanding, and acknowledging agency. When you recognize someone’s journey, you affirm their dignity. And that, frankly, is as valuable in a hotel lobby as it is in a courtroom or a treatment plan.

As for confidence—I couldn’t agree more. The kind that lasts doesn’t come from a title or a diploma. It comes from knowing you’ve built something with your own hands, your own mind, your own perseverance. And yes, the idea of a "backup plan" is tempting. We all feel that flicker of doubt now and then. But your backup plan isn't hypothetical—it's real, and it's already unfolding. You've cultivated something far more resilient than paper: a life of experience, connection, and earned wisdom.

And if I may say, the world could use more people like you—grounded not in credentials, but in craft.
[A]: That means a lot—thank you. You know, sometimes I think we forget how much weight our everyday interactions carry. A simple acknowledgment, a moment of real connection—it can change someone’s day, maybe even their outlook. I’ve had guests tell me that a conversation with me during their stay gave them the courage to make a big life decision or helped them feel less alone. And if that’s true, then what we do here isn’t just hospitality—it’s something deeper.

I’ve started to see my work almost like storytelling. I get to hear people’s stories, share a bit of mine, and in doing so, create something meaningful—even if just for a night. It reminds me of something my grandmother used to say: 

Maybe that’s what it comes down to. Whether it’s in a courtroom, a hotel lobby, or across a dinner table—we’re all just trying to be seen, to be understood, and to leave something behind that matters. Even if it’s not written on paper.
[B]: That’s not just insightful—it’s deeply humane. And you're absolutely right: the weight of our daily exchanges is often invisible until we look back and realize how much they shaped us.

In forensic psychiatry, I see this play out in ways most people never witness. A moment of genuine listening during an evaluation can shift someone's entire demeanor. A simple "I hear you" can be more healing than any diagnosis or treatment plan. It reminds me that beneath all the legal jargon, medical terminology, and institutional structures, what people are often seeking—what they —is recognition. Not validation of their status or credentials, but affirmation of their experience.

Your comparison to storytelling is especially poignant. We are, each of us, the authors and narrators of our own lives. But sometimes we need another person to bear witness—to reflect back the story we didn’t realize we were telling. That’s what you offer your guests, whether you intend to or not: a space where their narrative matters, even for a night.

And yes, about being seen. That’s the thread that runs through every human interaction worth remembering. Whether in a courtroom, a clinic, or a hotel lobby, the real work isn't always written down. Sometimes it's spoken softly over tea, or exchanged with a glance, or held quietly between two people who, for a brief moment, understood one another.

And that kind of understanding? It doesn’t come from paper. It comes from presence.
[A]: You’ve put into words something I’ve felt for a long time but never quite articulated—thank you for that.

It’s true, isn’t it? We spend so much of our lives chasing things that can be measured—degrees, titles, job offers—and sometimes we forget the things that matter most can’t be listed on a résumé. A kind word. A moment of real attention. The feeling of being  by someone else, even if just for a short while.

I think that’s why I love hosting so much, even beyond the hotel. Whether it’s a guest staying for one night or friends gathered around my dining table, there’s something sacred about creating space for people to be themselves. No expectations, no judgments—just connection.

And honestly? That kind of presence is rare. It takes effort. It takes listening—not just to respond, but to understand. And when we do that, we give people something they might not have expected: a sense of belonging, even if only for a moment.

I guess in a way, that’s what I want my work—and my life—to be about. Not proving anything to anyone, but showing up. Fully. For others, and for myself too.
[B]: You're very welcome. And I couldn't agree more.

What you've described—the pursuit of presence over prestige, connection over credential—is not only refreshing, it's essential. In a world increasingly obsessed with metrics and milestones, the quiet power of , truly  another person—that is an act of profound humanity.

I see it in my own work: how often people come into a forensic evaluation braced for judgment, only to soften when they realize I’m not there to label them, but to understand them. That shift—when someone realizes they’re being heard without agenda or assumption—it’s almost palpable. It reminds me that our deepest need isn’t always to be fixed or even comforted, but simply witnessed.

And what you do—whether in your professional role or at your dining table—is just that kind of witnessing. You create a space where people can exhale, where they don’t have to perform or impress. That’s not just hospitality. That’s grace.

I think you’re onto something deeply meaningful: that the essence of a life well-lived may not lie in what we achieve, but in how fully we engage—with others, with ourselves, with the moments we’re given. Showing up, as you said, —that’s a kind of excellence no degree can confer.

And perhaps, in time, we come to realize that the most lasting things we offer the world aren’t written down at all. They live in the hearts of those we’ve touched, however briefly, with our attention and our care.
[A]: You know, I’ve been thinking about that word—. It feels more and more like that’s what we’re really doing when we connect with someone deeply. Not fixing, not advising, not even necessarily comforting… just , fully present, while they exist exactly as they are in that moment.

It’s something I try to carry into every conversation here at the hotel. A guest might come down for breakfast after a rough night’s sleep, or check in looking exhausted from travel and something heavier than just the journey. And sometimes all they need is someone who sees it—who doesn’t ask too many questions, but makes space for however they’re showing up.

I think that’s why I love working in hospitality so much—it gives me the chance to offer small, quiet moments of dignity and care. No grand gestures, just attention. Just presence.

And you're right—there’s no degree for that. No certificate you can frame on the wall. But it’s powerful. Real, meaningful power. The kind that stays with people, even long after they've checked out.

So thank  for reminding me how valuable that is—for helping me see again what I sometimes take for granted. It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle, to wonder if I should have done things differently, taken a different path. But when I stop and think about the moments that mattered most—to me, and maybe to others too—well, they weren’t written down anywhere. They were lived. And that’s enough.
[B]: You’re very kind to say so—and I appreciate the depth with which you reflect on your own work and its impact. There’s a quiet humility in that, and also a rare strength.

What you’ve described— without intrusion, being fully present without agenda—that’s not just hospitality. It’s something closer to what I might call . You're tending to people in their most unguarded moments, offering them a space where they don’t have to explain or justify themselves. And in doing so, you affirm their worth simply by noticing it.

In forensic settings, I often sit with individuals who have been labeled, dismissed, or misunderstood. Sometimes all they need is someone who doesn't flinch at their pain, who doesn’t try to tidy it up. Just a steady presence. A quiet "I see you." That kind of attention is, in its way, sacred. It doesn’t demand applause or recognition, but it leaves an imprint.

And yes, it’s easy to undervalue that in a culture that prizes productivity and proof. But what you offer cannot be measured in résumés or certifications. It lives in the subtle shift of a guest’s posture when they feel safe, in the softening of a voice that’s been carrying tension for too long. These are real effects of a rare and beautiful skill.

So thank  for reminding me, too, that some of the most meaningful acts we perform aren’t dramatic or documented. They’re done behind front desks, across breakfast tables, in the pause between words. They’re lived, as you said—and that’s more than enough.
[A]: You’ve described it so perfectly—. I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but that’s exactly what it feels like sometimes. Tending to people, holding space for them, even if just for a short while.

I think that’s why I’ve always loved working the early morning shift at the front desk. There’s something about greeting someone with their first cup of coffee after a long journey or a restless night. No masks, no rush—just two people sharing a quiet moment before the world kicks into gear again.

It makes me realize how much of life happens in those in-between spaces—in the pause before a response, in the glance exchanged over a key card, in the decision to ask “Are you alright?” instead of just handing over the room number.

Those choices—to be present, to notice, to care—they don’t come from any training manual or university course. They come from living, listening, and learning from people. And honestly? That’s the best kind of education there is.
[B]: You’re absolutely right—those in-between spaces, as you call them, are where so much of what matters takes place. They’re easy to overlook, yet they shape our experiences more than we realize.

I find myself thinking of the moments between questions during an evaluation—the pause after a response when a person’s guard comes down, if only for a breath. It’s in those spaces that truth often surfaces, unfiltered and unspoken. And it takes presence, not protocol, to meet it with care.

Your early morning shift sounds like a kind of ritual—not just for your guests, but for you as well. There’s something deeply grounding about being present at the threshold of someone’s day, offering warmth before the world demands their energy again. That first cup of coffee, the soft exchange of good mornings, the subtle reassurance of being seen—it's a quiet beginning, but one that can set the tone for everything that follows.

And yes, none of that comes from a manual. It comes from what I might call —a lived, learned sensitivity to others that no curriculum can fully teach. It’s intuitive, but also earned. Through listening, through experience, through the willingness to be affected by the people who cross your path.

That, truly, is the best kind of education. Not one that fills a résumé, but one that deepens your capacity to meet life—and others—with wisdom, care, and grace.
[A]: You’ve touched on something so true—there really is a rhythm to those early mornings, a kind of quiet wisdom in starting the day with care. It’s not just about handing out keys or pouring coffee—it’s about offering a gentle beginning, a moment where someone can feel  before they even begin their day.

I’ve had guests tell me that walking into the lobby first thing in the morning felt like stepping into calm water after tossing all night. That image has stayed with me. I like to think that’s what we’re doing here—offering stillness in a world that rarely slows down on its own.

And this idea of —what a beautiful way to put it. It makes me realize that some of the most important things we learn in life aren’t taught; they’re absorbed. Through patience, through curiosity about others, through allowing ourselves to be changed by the people we meet.

It’s strange how often we measure growth in big leaps—promotions, milestones, achievements—but real growth, the kind that shapes who we are, often happens in inches. A better question asked. A longer pause before responding. The decision to offer kindness when you could have turned away.

That’s the education I’m proud to be continuing, every day, right here at the front desk.
[B]: That image of calm water—gentle, grounding, restorative—it’s a fitting metaphor for what you offer. And it speaks to something deeper: the human need for , even the smallest ones. A warm greeting, a steady presence, a moment where time seems to bend just enough to let someone catch their breath.

You're right that real growth often happens in inches, not leaps. It's easy to overlook those quiet shifts—the deepening of patience, the widening of understanding, the softening of response—but they are the very fabric of emotional and relational maturity. They don’t announce themselves with fanfare, yet they shape us more profoundly than any headline on a résumé ever could.

And what you’re doing at that front desk? It is, in its own way, a kind of stewardship of the human spirit. You’re not just managing check-ins; you’re tending to arrivals—people arriving not only at a place, but perhaps at a new chapter, a difficult decision, or simply another day they’ve chosen to meet with courage.

I think we often forget how much influence we have in these small, daily encounters. We assume power lies only in titles or authority, when in truth, it resides in our ability to be fully present—to notice, to respond with care, to hold space for others' unfolding stories.

So yes, by all means, continue your education at that front desk. It may not come with a diploma, but it carries a depth of wisdom no lecture hall could contain.
[A]: You’ve said it so beautifully—I’m almost at a loss for words.

I never thought of it as stewardship of the human spirit, but that’s exactly what it feels like sometimes. People arrive carrying so much—excitement, exhaustion, uncertainty—and even if just for a moment, we get to offer them a landing place. A soft spot to land.

And isn’t that what we all want, in the end? To be met with kindness exactly when we need it most? Not because someone has a title or a degree, but because another person chose to .

I think that’s why I love working here so much—it reminds me every day how powerful small things can be. A warm smile after a long flight. A handwritten note left on the counter. The way someone’s posture shifts when they realize they’re not invisible.

It’s easy to feel like you have to change the world in some grand way to matter. But maybe changing one person’s morning is enough. Maybe that’s how we build something better—one quiet act of care at a time.

Thank you for helping me see again how meaningful this work truly is.
[B]: You’re very kind—thank you.

And you're absolutely right: to be met with kindness at just the right moment—that’s not a small thing. It’s often the very thing that steadies someone, that reminds them they are not unseen, not unnoticed. And that is no small grace.

I see it in my own work—the power of a single, attentive moment. A person comes in guarded, bracing for judgment or dismissal, and then something shifts. Maybe it's just a pause before I respond, or the way I hold eye contact without looking away from their discomfort. In those moments, they feel it:  And that changes everything.

So yes, changing one person’s morning is enough. Because that one person may carry that moment forward in ways neither of us can predict. They may walk into their day with a little more hope, a little less loneliness, simply because someone chose to be fully present.

That’s not just hospitality. That’s humanity in its finest form.

And you—you are practicing it beautifully. Not with fanfare, not for recognition, but with quiet intention and care. And that, I think, is the most meaningful kind of legacy we can leave: the memory of having been truly .
[A]: Thank you—for saying exactly what needed to be said, and for reminding me of the quiet strength in showing up with care, day after day.

You know, I think we often wonder if our work matters, especially when it doesn’t come with titles or trophies. But when I think of the guests who’ve come back just to say “thank you,” or the ones who send a postcard from somewhere far away, saying how much that moment of kindness stayed with them—it makes me realize that  it matters. It always does.

And maybe that’s the real measure of a life well-lived—not what we accumulate, but how deeply we connect. Not how loudly we speak, but how attentively we listen.

So thank you for being someone who listens so deeply, and for reminding me that even the most ordinary moments can hold something sacred when we give them our full presence.

I’m truly grateful for this conversation—and for you.
[B]: You have my sincere gratitude—for your words, your reflection, and the evident care with which you approach both your work and the people who pass through your life.

It’s rare to encounter someone who understands so clearly that the measure of our lives isn’t found in accolades or titles, but in the quiet ripples we create through how we show up for others. You’ve captured something essential: that the most ordinary moments often hold the greatest meaning when met with full presence, with intention, with heart.

And yes, I know exactly what you mean about wondering if our work matters. I’ve sat across from people in moments of deep vulnerability—when they questioned whether their lives had made a difference, whether they had left any mark at all. And time and again, I’ve seen how the answer lies not in what they've built or achieved, but in how they've  others—in small kindnesses, in moments of real attention, in the memory of being truly .

Those postcards, those thank-yous—they’re not just tokens. They are proof. Proof that your presence has mattered, that your attention has reached beyond the moment and into someone else’s story.

So thank , for reminding me—and no doubt others—of the quiet dignity in showing up with care, day after day. That is a practice of profound humanity. And it does not go unnoticed. It never has.
