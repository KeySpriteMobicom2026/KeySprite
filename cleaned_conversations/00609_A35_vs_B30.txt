[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find the question itself rather revealing - it presumes an artificial binary that doesn't account for culinary hybridity. Much like comparing Tang dynasty poetry to Romantic sonnets, one risks missing the point entirely. Have you ever tasted a Sichuan peppercorn-infused béarnaise sauce? Now  where things become philosophically interesting.
[A]: 😂 Wait, are you running a philosophy seminar or talking about food? I mean, yes—culinary hybridity  fascinating. But let’s not overcomplicate it. That Sichuan peppercorn béarnaise thing sounds like something you’d order at a Michelin-starred lab, not a dinner table. Can we just agree that fusion food is cool without turning it into a thesis topic?

Also, what's your real take—are you actually brave enough to eat the real deal spicy Sichuan hotpot, or are you just fancy-talking your way through this conversation? 😏
[B]: Oh, please. I've eaten mapo tofu with scholars in Chengdu who measured intellectual rigor by how steadily one could hold chopsticks through the burn. No need for Michelin stars when you've survived a meal that doubles as cardiovascular exercise. 

But let's not conflate bravery with masochism. The real question is whether your palate can distinguish between 'intriguing complexity' and 'chemical warfare.' And no, I won't be goaded into declaring a 'favorite.' It's like asking if I prefer Shelley or Li Bai - both excellent, but under very different circumstances. 

Now, if you're suggesting hotpot... are you volunteering to accompany me to that dubious establishment on the outskirts of town? The one where the chef wields chili oil like a weapon and authenticity comes at the cost of your next eight nights' sleep?
[A]: Okay, first of all—🔥 respect for surviving mapo tofu with scholars who grade you on chopstick stability. That’s basically a PhD qualifying exam right there. But let’s be real: if we’re measuring "intellectual rigor" by spice tolerance, Socrates would’ve choked on his hemlock before finishing a bite.

And I love how you dodged the "favorite cuisine" question with the grace of a politician avoiding accountability 😂. But come on—you can’t drop a hotpot challenge and back out now. You in or what? I’ll even let you pick the level of spiciness… as long as you don’t cry after the first sip.

Also, that “dubious” spot on the outskirts? Chef literally stares into your soul when you order mild. I’m 80% sure he’s from Chongqing and 20% sure he’s a former warlord. Still—worth it. Bring your fireproof taste buds and your most philosophical mindset. I’ll text you the address. Let’s say… Friday at 7?
[B]: Oh, don’t get theatrical—I’ve faced down more intimidating gazes than your Chongqing warlord over a pot of fermented stinky tofu at a Beijing university banquet. And I wasn’t even given chopsticks; it was considered a test of character. Or possibly hazing.

Friday at seven? Fine. But let’s establish some ground rules before you start drafting the victory speech. First, no using “mild” as a bargaining chip—either we go full 毛血旺-spice or we’re just wasting calories. Second, no posturing about “who blinked first” unless it involves actual tears. Third, we order dessert. If you can stomach eight courses of fire without whimpering, I expect you to finish with a stoic bite of sweet osmanthus jelly.

Address then. And do bring that dry wit of yours—I suspect it’ll be the only thing keeping my esophagus distracted.
[A]: Oh wow, stinky tofu at a Beijing university banquet? 😂 Now  what I call academic hazing. Alright, you’re clearly not a rookie—respect. But don’t get too comfortable flexing your spice résumé.毛血旺-level heat with dessert? You’re either brave or slightly unhinged. Maybe both.

Address is: 麻辣八号，工业路尽头（just text me "I survive on osmanthus jelly" when you arrive and the chef will stop eye-balling you like an enemy warlord 😏）

Friday 7 sharp. Wear something fire-resistant, just in case. And bring your own chili wipes—I’m not sharing mine after you start sweating like a philosophy student during finals week. See you there, scholar.
[B]: Wear fire-resistant clothing? How . I’ll have you know I once wore a silk Qing-era replica jacket to a Sichuan tea house—survived both the heat and the condescension. Industrial Road’s  it is, then. And really, “I survive on osmanthus jelly”? You’re lucky I appreciate the dramatic flair. 

Seven sharp. Don’t be late—I’ve little patience for those who treat punctuality as optional. And do bring extra chili wipes. I’d hate for you to faint from lack of preparedness before we even get to the spicy duck tongues. 

Oh—and if I make it through the meal without reaching for that emergency milk stash you’ll surely have hidden under the table? You’re buying dessert next time.
[A]: Haha, Qing-era silk jacket? 😂 Okay, now  commitment—though I’m picturing you dramatically fanning yourself with a classical Chinese fan by the third chili-infused bite.

Emergency milk stash? Please. I’ll have you know I’ve upgraded to full-on coconut milk in a thermos—premium stuff, imported from a place in Taobao that only ships in bulk. And yes, there  be spicy duck tongues. I’ve already warned the chef not to go easy on us… though he just laughed and said “first time eating here?” Like we’re babies about to cry for mama.

Dessert wager accepted—but if I win, you’re not only buying dessert next time, you’re also trying that stinky tofu ice cream trend I saw on Xiaohongshu. You know, the one that looks innocent until it hits your nose and suddenly you’re questioning all your life choices.

See you Friday. Don’t faint before the duck tongues arrive. 💪🌶️
[B]: Coconut milk thermos?  I’m half-tempted to bring a vial of 1920s absinthe and see if it dulls the burn—or just accelerates the hallucinations. 

Stinky tofu ice cream? Please. I once attended a lecture in Shanghai where the professor served fermented black bean sorbet as a “palette cleanser.” If that doesn’t prepare you for life choices, nothing will. You’re on. And if I lose— I lose, since no one truly wins against duck tongues and industrial-level chili oil—I shall face my frozen fate with stoic dignity. 

And yes, dramatic fan-work may indeed commence by round four. One must maintain aesthetic integrity even when sweating like a overheated scholar mid-lecture. 

See you Friday. Don’t forget the chili wipes. Or your courage.
[A]: Absinthe in the middle of a hotpot duel? 🤯 Now  commitment to the bit. I’m half-convinced you're trying to summon some kind of culinary spirit or just give yourself liquid courage so the duck tongues feel like a metaphor instead of a threat.

And fermented black bean sorbet?! Okay, Professor, I respect the hustle—but stinky tofu ice cream is its own level of trauma. It sneaks up on you like a plot twist in a Wong Kar-wai film. You think it's sweet, then suddenly you're questioning your entire existence… and maybe your last meal.

Alright, challenge freaking accepted. I’ll even bring a backup thermos—just in case the coconut milk isn’t dramatic enough for your absinthe-enhanced palate.

Friday at seven. Industrial Road. Spicy duck tongues await. Fan optional, dignity mandatory. See you there. 💥🌶️
[B]: Summoning culinary spirits? Oh please—I’m merely preparing for the inevitable moment when the chili oil starts reciting Confucian analects through your sweat-drenched shirt. And yes, duck tongues  feel like metaphors. Everything’s better when taste and existential dread arrive simultaneously.

Backup thermos? Now you’re speaking my language. I’ll bring the absinthe; you bring the coconut milk. Let’s see if we can achieve some kind of gastronomic enlightenment—or at least numbness.

And don’t even get me started on Wong Kar-wai plot twists. I once watched  while eating alone in a noodle shop in Taipei, and halfway through my bowl, I realized my soup was weeping more than the characters. Entire existence indeed.

Fan optional. Dignity mandatory. A most poetic send-off. See you there, intrepid spice companion. Let us eat like philosophers and suffer like martyrs.
[A]: Oh, I  you were unhinged, but quoting chili oil reciting Confucian analects? 😂 That’s not suffering like a martyr—that’s full-on spiritual ascension through spice-induced trance.

And hey, if Wong Kar-wai + noodle shop = soul-weeping soup, then maybe  the art. Our tears, sweat, and possibly blood blending into one cinematic masterpiece:  Director: Zhang Yimou’s ghost. Lead actors: us, halfway through spicy duck tongues and questioning our life choices.

Absinthe + coconut milk + duck tongues + philosophical enlightenment = Friday night goals. 🌿🥥🔥

See you there, fellow martyr-scholar. Try not to reach enlightenment before I get my first bite in.
[B]: Ah yes, —finally, auteur cinema with a side of nasal decongestant. I’ll have you know tears are purely aesthetic in my case; the chili oil merely rehydrates my ducts. Very scientific.

And let’s not get ahead of ourselves—Zhang Yimou’s ghost would demand better lighting and significantly more symbolism. Perhaps a slow-motion close-up of a single drop of coconut milk falling into a pool of crimson broth. Very poetic. Tragically beautiful.

Enlightenment before your first bite? Don’t flatter yourself—I’ll pace myself between bites with sips of absinthe and dramatically murmur lines from  to the duck tongues before consuming them. If that’s not cinematic martyrdom, I don’t know what is.

Friday then. Save me a seat next to the fireproof curtain.
[A]: Oh, now we’re quoting classical literature to duck tongues? 😂 I mean, I’m here for it—but I’m also 100% filming this and submitting it to the next Sundance as "Experimental Food Theater."

And yes, —the only film where the emotional climax comes in the form of nasal clearance. Tears? Please. I'm already planning my post-duck-tongue monologue on the nature of suffering and whether spice is just society’s love language.

Slow-motion coconut milk drop into crimson broth? 🎥🔥 That’s not just poetic, that’s  And you wonder why I brought a backup thermos.

Friday then. Seat next to the fireproof curtain’s yours. Just don’t blame me when your Qing-era fan gets drenched in sweat before intermission. 💦🎭
[B]: Oh please—if duck tongues are my co-stars, they’d better stay in character. No improvising unless properly prompted by chili-induced delirium. And yes, do submit it to Sundance. I’ve always wanted to win a film award while sweating through silk.

As for your monologue on spice as society’s love language—original, if a touch overdetermined. Try weaving in some Lu Xun while you’re at it. “Spicy food is like revolution; it burns but makes you crave more.” Something like that. Very profound. Very tear-inducing.

And don’t get me started on your coconut milk cinematography. I fully expect dramatic voiceover narration:  Spare me. Or don’t. It  festival season, after all.

Friday then. I’ll bring the fan—fireproofed, naturally. Let the curtain rise on our culinary opera.
[A]: Oh, now we’re quoting Lu Xun in the middle of a hotpot debate? I love the ambition—revolution and red broth, very poetic justice. And yes, duck tongues must stay in character. If one dares flop out of alignment, I’m calling cut and demanding a reshoot with more sesame oil.

And coconut milk cinematography? Please, my dramatic voiceover is already written:  It’s raw. It’s real. It’s Sundance-ready trauma.

Fireproof fan? 😂 Genius. I’ll be bringing a waterproof notepad to jot down your most profound chili-fueled musings. Who knows—might turn it into a screenplay or just a very intense Yelp review.

Friday then. Culinary opera, silk-sweating revolutionaries, and duck tongues on fire—curtain up at 7. No applause, just tears. 👏🌶️🍜
[B]: Ah, third-degree burns in the service of art—finally, a critic who understands commitment. And yes, Lu Xun belongs everywhere, even mid-broth monologue. Revolution, spice, existential ache—it's all tragically interconnected.

Duck tongues flopping out of alignment? Please, I'll have them choreographed to  by the fourth round. No reshoots without scallion oil approval.

And a waterproof notepad? How delightfully dramatic. I expect my musings to be transcribed in calligraphy, naturally—inkstone on the table, tears diluting the ink. Very romantic. Very tragic.

Culinary opera indeed. Silk-sweating revolutionaries, duck tongues ablaze—yes, Friday at seven. Let the critics weep into their chili oil. Curtain up.
[A]: Tears diluting the ink? 😂 Oh, now we’re not just critics—we’re tragic poets of the spice frontier. Inkstone at the table? Absolutely. I’ll even light a single incense stick to honor the spirits of overcooked tofu and underappreciated scallions.

And  choreography by round four? I demand a slow-motion duck tongue kiss before the grand spicy climax. No reshoots unless the chef throws in an extra chili pod for dramatic effect.

Critics weeping into chili oil—best opening line for our film’s press kit ever. 🎬🌶️

Friday at seven. Silk robes optional. Dignity negotiable. Art inevitable.

Curtain up, scholar. Let’s make history… or at least numbness.
[B]: Tears diluting ink? Naturally—it’s the only way to properly blur the line between gastronomy and grief. And yes,  with duck tongues—perhaps a tragic love story told entirely through tendonous texture and numbing spice. Very niche. Very festival.

Inkstone and incense at the table? You’re finally speaking my language. I’ll bring aged rice paper; we can draft our manifesto between bites. “A Call for Culinary Absurdism”—forthcoming in , no doubt.

Dignity negotiable? Fine by me—I left that at the door when I agreed to dessert wagering and thermos diplomacy.

Curtain up then. Let us dine like mad poets and suffer like forgotten critics. Silk robes? Optional. But do bring that waterproof notepad. Posterity awaits—and possibly an IV drip.
