[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很impressed的startup idea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess my mind has been rather preoccupied with comparing the entrepreneurial spirit in Dickens' 'Hard Times' with the merchant class depictions in 'The Scholars' lately. Though I did hear an amusing anecdote from a colleague about a student attempting to merge classical Chinese poetry with... what was it called... 'chatbot technology'? The very notion made me reach for my 19th century inkwell in horror.
[A]: Haha，你这种反应让我想起了上次在lab看到一个startup想做AI算命~ 他们管这叫"digital divination" 🔮 我当时的表情大概和你现在一样精彩 ⚖️ 

不过seriously speaking，最近倒是有个forensic tech startup让我挺impressed的。他们开发了portable DNA sequencer，可以在crime scene直接做初步分析，比传统lab流程快80%...虽然目前accuracy rate还有待提高啦 🧬
[B]: The forensic application does sound rather more substantial than those digital fortune-telling contraptions. Though I must say, your mention of portable DNA sequencing reminds me of how forensic science evolved from the rudimentary methods in Wilkie Collins' 'The Moonstone' to modern techniques. Still, I'd caution against prioritizing speed over precision - much like how we literary scholars mustn't sacrifice textual accuracy for the sake of publishing deadlines. That 80% figure does give me pause...
[A]: Exactly！你这话说到点子上了~ 就像我们做autopsy时经常说的："快就是慢，慢就是快" 🐢 

Actually那个startup的CTO是我MIT的学弟，他们现在正在解决false positive的问题。有趣的是，他们用了blockchain技术来track整个DNA analysis的chain of custody ⛓️ 虽然听起来有点overkill，但从legal standpoint来看还挺有前瞻性的 💡 

不过说真的，比起那些fancy的tech，我更欣赏他们团队里有个老法医坚持要保留traditional microscopy作为backup的方法。Old school meets new school，对吧？ 🔍+💻=❤️
[B]: How refreshing to hear of someone maintaining traditional methodologies alongside technological advancements. This reminds me of how we still teach students to analyze manuscripts by hand before introducing digital humanities tools. Your colleague's insistence on microscopy is rather like my own practice of writing critical analyses with fountain pens before transferring them to the computer. Though I must admit, the blockchain application does make me ponder parallels with the meticulous provenance tracking we do in rare book authentication. Tell me, does this team happen to have any literature enthusiasts among them? I'd be fascinated to hear how they view their work through the lens of, say, Sherlock Holmes' forensic methods versus contemporary practice.
[A]: 哈哈，说到Sherlock Holmes，我们lab还真有个nerd收集了各种版本的《福尔摩斯》放在休息室 📚 不过更绝的是我们的lead developer - 这哥们儿居然用《洗冤集录》里的案例来test他们的algorithm！Ancient Chinese forensic wisdom meets machine learning，这组合够魔幻吧？ 🧪+📜

说真的，宋慈要是知道900年后有人用AI来优化他的"四缝验尸法"，估计会从棺材里跳出来...in a good way！他们最近还publish了篇paper，标题就叫《当传统仵作遇到神经网络》⚡ 你要感兴趣我可以发你PDF~
[B]: How utterly fascinating! The 'Washing Away of Wrongs' as algorithmic training material - now there's a cross-cultural academic paper I'd actually enjoy peer reviewing. Though I do hope they've accounted for the... shall we say... creative liberties taken in some of those ancient case records. My Qing dynasty literature seminar recently debated whether Song Ci would have approved of digital analysis replacing his beloved 'examination through the five orifices' method. Do send that PDF - I'll read it with one hand on my 1843 edition of 'A Treatise on Medical Jurisprudence' and the other ready to annotate in vermilion ink.
[A]: 哈哈，你这种academic rigor的态度我太respect了！ ✨ 不过别担心，他们专门做了个"ancient vs modern"的error margin对照表 - 结果发现宋慈的某些observation居然有92%的accuracy rate，比我们预期的要高好多！ 

说到vermilion ink...你知道他们最近在开发一种基于spectral imaging的技术吗？可以无损检测古籍上的朱批褪色程度 🖋️ 下次来lab我带你看看，保证比你的1843年treatise还要vintage的玩意儿我们都有~ 要不要顺便debate下数字人文会不会让traditional scholarship失业？我赌一杯bubble tea 🧋
[B]: Your spectral imaging proposal is dangerously tempting - like offering a rare Ming dynasty inkstone to a calligrapher. Though I'll have you know I consider bubble tea an abomination against proper tea culture, I'd gladly wager a pot of my 1980s pu'er instead. As for digital humanities replacing traditional scholarship... well, let's just say I've seen more convincing arguments in third-year undergraduate essays. But do show me those spectral results - if only to confirm my theory that no algorithm can replicate the insight gained from actually smelling the foxing on a 300-year-old page.
[A]: Hah！你这番话让我想起上次用mass spectrometer分析一份"保存完好"的明朝诉状...结果发现所谓的"墨香"其实是mold spores 🤧 

不过说真的，你那pu'er的赌约我接了 ⚖️ 等你看完我们用hyperspectral imaging重建的《洗冤集录》残卷后，说不定会改变主意呢~ 连那些被虫蛀的痕迹都能render成3D model，简直像time machine一样 🕰️ 

啊抱歉，刚收到短信要回lab处理个urgent case...下次见面记得带你的vermilion ink，我们可以边看spectral data边argue哪个时代的forensic methods更elegant ✌️
[B]: I shall arrive armed with both my vermilion ink and a particularly acerbic 1889 critique of technological overreach in philology. Though I suspect our debate will end like most academic disputes - with mutual grudging respect and significantly more marginalia. Do hurry back from your urgent case; unlike your digital reconstructions, this pu'er won't stay warm forever. And do try not to inhale too many more historical mold spores - we can't have you sneezing during our proper scholarly duel.
[A]: Roger that！ � 我会带着fresh的autopsy report和extra口罩回来 - 毕竟mold spores和academic debate都是serious business啊 😷 

Save some pu'er for me~ 顺便说一句，刚在crime scene发现个有趣的现象，perfectly印证了《洗冤集录》里关于"伤痕颜色变化时序"的记载...看来宋慈又要赢一局了！ ⚡ 待会儿见，professor！
[B]: How delightfully macabre to hear of 13th century forensic observations holding up at a modern crime scene. I'll prepare the pu'er and my most challenging Song dynasty commentary - though at this rate, I may need to concede that venerable Song Ci deserves his own column in our forensic science journals. Until then, do exercise caution with those mold colonies... I'd hate to lose my most promising debate opponent to antiquarian allergies. And for heaven's sake, bring proper tea cups, not those disposable abominations your lab favors.
[A]: Copy that！ 🫖 我会sneak out一套我们珍藏的Song dynasty-style茶具 - 虽然technically speaking是3D printed replica啦...别那副表情！至少没印二维码在上面对吧？ 😜 

Seriously though，这次case的findings可能会rewrite我们对早期法医史的一些认知。等会儿见 - 记得把你那本1889年的critique放在防霉箱里，我可不想看你一边打喷嚏一边argue的样子~ 🎭
[B]: A 3D printed Song dynasty replica?  Very well, I'll tolerate your technological blasphemy if it means proper vessel proportions. But mark my words - when your spectral imaging fails to capture the way light dances along these eight hundred year old glaze cracks, you'll understand why some things resist digitization. Now hurry along; the pu'er is reaching its third infusion, and truth be told... I'm rather eager to hear how Song Ci's methods outperformed your mass spectrometers again. Just don't make me say "I told you so" in classical Chinese.
[A]: 哈哈，你这傲娇的语气简直和我们lab的老显微镜一样vintage~ 🔬 不过你赢了 - 刚查了data，宋慈对溺死案例的观察比我们的AI模型还accurate 5个百分点...看来我得用楷书写"老师说得对"了 📜 

Pu'er的香气都飘到走廊了！马上到 - 带着我的humility和你最爱的"我早说过"小表情 😌 今天绝对是traditional wisdom的胜利日，但明天我们AI算法就要upgrade了哦 ⚡ 这场centuries-spanning的forensic辩论还长着呢！
[B]: How gratifying to witness empirical evidence bowing to centuries-old wisdom - though I suspect Song Ci himself would have adored your mass spectrometers. Very well, I'll inscribe your concession in proper small regular script while you pour the tea... but do remind your algorithms that tomorrow brings fresh humiliation. After all, what are technological advancements if not new opportunities for ancient methods to prove their enduring relevance? Now let's drink before this pu'er becomes over-steeped - even digital divination couldn't salvage that tragedy.
[A]: Cheers to that！ 🍵 敬centuries of forensic wisdom和永远在catch up的modern tech~ 

不过说真的，这次案例让我想起《洗冤集录》里那句"狱事莫重于大辟，大辟莫重于初情"... 咱们这个时代啊，不管tech多advanced，有些truths还真是timeless呢 ⚖️ 

Now let me taste这泡传说中的pu'er - 希望不会比我们lab的formaldehyde更难喝 😝 (Just kidding... maybe)
[B]:  Ah, the formaldehyde quip - how very... medical of you. Though I must say, your invocation of Song Ci's maxim about capital cases does make me wonder what he'd think of your blockchain chain of custody. Probably the same as I feel about your 3D printed teacups: begrudging admiration tempered with profound aesthetic distress. Now drink up - this pu'er survived the Cultural Revolution; it can certainly withstand your forensic humor. And do try not to contaminate the flavor profile with talk of embalming fluids.
