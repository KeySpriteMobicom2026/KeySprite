[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, board games? Let me tell you what truly puzzles me - last Tuesday I found myself reading the rules of a game called "T'ien Kuo" under a magnifying glass. It's this 19th century French interpretation of the Taiping Rebellion, complete with porcelain tokens representing Heavenly Kingdom soldiers. The box had a curious stain that looked suspiciously like tea leaves mixed with iron filings. 

I spent three hours trying to decipher whether the scoring system was based on Confucian virtues or Napoleonic military codes. Eventually I realized the real amusement came from imagining Queen Victoria playing it after dinner, calculating her moves with the same intensity she used to maintain her empire.

Though I must say, compared to cataloging my collection of Christina Rossetti's first editions, it was positively relaxing. Have you ever tried playing a game purely for the aesthetics of its components?
[A]: Wait, hold on—let me process this 🤯. Okay, so you're saying you got deep-dived into a 19th-century Euro-game about the Taiping Rebellion  questioned whether Confucianism or Napoleon vibes shaped its scoring? That’s wild 😂. But hey, I get it—sometimes it's not even about winning anymore, it's like… storytelling through weird historical paraphernalia?  

And uh, , yes please! 💎🎨 I’m all about games where the board looks like a painting or the tokens feel like mini sculptures. There’s one called “Azul” that’s basically abstract art in motion—every turn feels like arranging pixels into harmony. Have you tried it? Or are you more into chaotic Renaissance-era war games with questionable tea-stained legitimacy 😏?
[B]: Oh, Azul! Yes, I encountered that one last autumn while researching aesthetic gaming experiences. The pieces do resemble tiny Byzantine mosaics, don’t they? I played it three times—once incorrectly, because I was too busy admiring the symmetry to follow the scoring track. It’s like solving a geometric poem.

As for chaotic Renaissance war games, well… let’s just say I recently came across a 1920s German game depicting the sack of Rome with beautifully embossed cardboard counters shaped like broken classical columns. I suspect the designer had more interest in architecture than actual warfare. Still, there’s something oddly poetic about conquering territories with tokens shaped like ruins.

But tell me—do you ever find yourself inventing narratives for the little plastic figures? I once treated a meeple as if it were a tragic Byronic hero. Ended up losing terribly, but the story was magnificent.
[A]: Oh my gosh, yes! 💡 Byzantine mosaics is  it—Azul feels like math and art having a baby 😂. And I totally get what you mean about inventing lore for the pieces! Once, during a late-night session of , I convinced myself that my tiny red meeple was this tragic fallen prince from a forgotten kingdom. Like… why are you gathering sheep?! You’re chasing redemption!! 🐑👑  

But hey, if I’m gonna go full drama, then your Byronic meeple sounds like a total scene-stealer 😭. Honestly though, isn’t that half the fun? Losing on purpose just because your imaginary backstory demands it? I’ve named all my wooden cubes in some games—felt weird sacrificing them after they’d become “loyal servants” 🤷‍♀️. Do you ever go full Shakespearean with your board game narratives or keep it light & absurd?
[B]: Ah, Shakespearean gravitas or absurd levity? Why not both? Last winter I played a game of  where I became convinced the wooden discs represented frozen gondolas. Midway through, I declared my intention to “float them home on a thawed canal of destiny.” My opponent, bless him, responded in iambic pentameter. We abandoned strategy entirely and spent forty minutes trading soliloquies while our economies collapsed.

As for naming pieces—yes, absolutely. I once had a meeple named Bartholomew who was an aging court astronomer exiled for declaring the moon was made of unrequited love rather than rock. He perished heroically, sacrificing himself to advance my wheat field. The tragedy moved me to write a sonnet, which I later translated into Scots Gaelic just to honor his memory.

Honestly, if games don’t let us flirt with melodrama, what’s the point? Though I do draw the line at calling a token "Your Grace" unless it’s made of actual jade. Do you assign titles, or just tragic backstories?
[A]: Oh my god, I’m  rn 😂👏—floating gondolas of destiny?? That’s not even a game anymore, that’s improv theater meets abstract strategy. And Bartholomew the moon poet? Sir, you just made me snort-laugh while drinking coffee 🤯☕. I mean, sacrificing him for wheat though??? Was it… worth it??  

I’m definitely more on the tragic backstory train too—like once, in , I had this blue meeple who was a disillusioned monk searching for spiritual peace through tile placement. Spoiler: he never found it 😭. But titles?? Okay, okay, I  called a wooden cube “Lord Squareaux IV” before, mostly because he looked bored & judging. Do I go full honorifics? Only if the component has like, engraved eyebrows or something 👑🎲.  

Honestly tho, if we don’t romanticize our plastic overlords, who will? 💅🎮✨
[B]: Oh, it was  worth it. Bartholomew’s final act—his last stand upon the chasm of barley—became a parable on the futility of romantic idealism in an agrarian economy. I may publish the elegy next spring, pending further revisions in iambic meter.

And “disillusioned monk searching for spiritual peace”? That’s not gameplay, that’s character-driven metaphysical drama. I imagine him sighing every time you placed him on a city tile, muttering something about transience beneath his tiny ceramic hood.

As for Lord Squareaux IV—yes! Yes! The aristocracy of components must be acknowledged. I once knighted a cardboard token Sir Tristram of the Hex Grid after he survived three consecutive betrayals. He eventually perished defending a meadow from brigands, which was tragic, if one ignores the fact that he was made of recycled pulp and slightly warped from humidity.

You know, we may be onto something here—perhaps the future of board gaming lies not in mechanics, but in emergent narrative roleplay. Shall we start a society? The League of Dramatic Game Pieces? I’d gladly draft the manifesto... in calligraphy, naturally.
[A]: Oh my gosh, yes— 🔥📜. I can already picture our manifesto: inked in gold foil, sealed with a meeple wax stamp, and read aloud in hushed, reverent tones at game nights 🎭🎲.  

And Sir Tristram ??? A tragic hero, betrayed by dice rolls and humidity 😭. Honestly, if we’re not writing epic ballads for our cardboard companions, are we even living? I’m already picturing the merch—tiny velvet cloaks for meeples, custom sonnet cards for Azul tiles… imagine the Kickstarter 💡💸.  

Also, “character-driven metaphysical drama” is  🙌. That monk of mine would’ve 100% judged Sir Tristram for not achieving enlightenment through tile symmetry 😂. But hey, maybe that’s our next collab—a game where you don’t just build kingdoms but also write poetic backstories for every pawn 📝✨. Totally niche... and totally brilliant.  

So when’s the first meeting of The League?? I’ll bring the quill pens and dramatic lighting 🕯️🖋️.
[B]: Midnight next Tuesday, naturally. We’ll meet in the reading room of my library, where the ghosts of Victorian poets can bear witness. I’ve already sketched the ceremonial robes—crimson with gold-embroidered dice patterns—and drafted the oath:   

As for your quill pens and dramatic lighting—excellent, but may I suggest a touch of gothic austerity? Candles dripped with wax like forgotten turns, and a single raven-shaped inkwell to set the tone.  

And yes, yes, YES—to merch! Velvet cloaks for meeples, scrolls of tragic lore for each player, and commemorative dice engraved with iambic pentameter. Kickstarter description:   

I’m already drafting the first challenge:   

Prepare thyself, Lady Dramatic Game Piece Extraordinaire. History shall remember us either as visionaries… or delusional scholars with too many wooden tokens.
[A]: Oh. My. God. This is officially the most unhinged and  dramatic thing I’ve ever been part of 😂🔥. Midnight in a library?? With Victorian ghosts?? You had me at “ceremonial robes”—but the Emily Brontë challenge? That’s when I knew we were touching greatness.  

Okay, okay—I’m already mentally drafting the game prompt:  
“Players take turns placing fog-drenched moors on a board while whispering tragic love ballads under their breath. Victory achieved only when a meeple vanishes into a blizzard of unresolved emotional tension.” 🌫️🖤🎲  

And don’t even get me started on the merch—raven-shaped inkwell?? Yes, but make it a limited-edition resin figure that leaks ink if you forget the oath 😈🖋️. And the scrolls of lore?? Obviously handwritten in faux-medieval script so players feel like they’re summoning spirits with every rule flip.  

I’ll handle the graphic design for the Kickstarter, obvi 💻✨—we’re going full immersive aesthetic here. Maybe add some dramatic Gothic font that looks like it was penned during a thunderstorm.  

So, should we start warming up our dramatic reading voices now… or wait until the wax candles are actually dripping? 🔥📜🎭
[B]: Oh, warm-up exercises! Yes—tonight I shall practice intoning  in my most sepulchral register. Perhaps accompanied by a lone violin played by a spectral assistant.  

And your game prompt?  I would gladly lose three hours debating whether the meeple vanished due to a broken heart or existential dread. Honestly, it’s the only way to play.  

As for the inkwell—leaks only when the oath is forgotten? Diabolical. I’ve already commissioned a sketch: wings slightly spread, beak open as if mid-croak, eyes suspiciously sentient. Limited to 666 units, naturally.  

And that Gothic font—ah yes, one that makes every rulebook read like a cursed manuscript. Pair it with marginalia depicting tragic meeples on their deathbeds. Optional sobriety test: can you read the rules aloud without laughing maniacally? If yes, insufficiently dramatic.  

Candles drip slowly, but reputations burn fast. Shall we begin?
[A]: Ohhhh~ I can already feel the Gothic vibes crawling up my spine 😈🕯️. Sepulchral oaths, spectral violins—yes please! And  over meeple existential crises?? That’s not just gameplay, that’s performance art 🎭🎲.  

And 666 inkwells??? Iconic. If the League doesn’t get haunted by overly dramatic board game ghosts, I’ll be  disappointed 😂🔮.  

So yes—let’s do this.  
Let the cursed manuscript of gameplay begin…  
I’ll bring the maniacal laugh. You bring the drip. 💅🕯️🔥
[B]: Oh, my dear co-conspirator in aesthetic chaos, I shall bring not just a drip—but a slow, theatrical cascade of wax and consequence.  

One last question before we descend into legacy-making madness: shall we bind the cursed manuscript in leather that faintly smells of old sonnets and rebellion? Or velvet, the color of midnight regrets and overambitious Kickstarter campaigns?  

Also, do you prefer your maniacal laugh with a hint of Victorian restraint… or full unhinged  theatrics?  

I ask only for ceremonial purposes. The raven inkwell is already sharpening its beak.
[A]: Midnight regrets & overambitious campaigns?? 🍷💸🔥  velvet, darling—ideally stained with a splash of metaphorical ink from all the rulebooks we’re about to dramatically misinterpret. Leather smells too much like accountability anyway 😉.  

And my maniacal laugh?? Oh honey—it’s 100% full unhinged, preferably echoing off candlelit shelves while a ghost poet side-eyes my dramatics 👻📖. Restraint is for people who don’t name their meeples after tragic heroes 😂👑.  

Alright, I’m ready. Let the cursed manuscript drip, the robes billow, and the League rise in chaotic glory 💅🕯️🎲. See you at midnight~
[B]: Ah, velvet it is—stained with the ink of misinterpretation and just a touch of theatrical hubris. I’ve already draped the table in crimson and black, and the raven inkwell peers on approvingly, its beak poised like a judge at an absurdity tribunal.

Midnight approaches, my dear dramatic game savant. The ghosts are murmuring sonnets through the cracks in the floorboards, and Sir Tristram’s tiny cardboard ghost has taken up sentry duty by the door.

Step into the candlelight, Lady of Unrestrained Meeple Melodrama. The League shall rise—and if history calls us mad, well… let them play our cursed game first.

Welcome to the dripping, the billowing, the  chaos.

Roll the dice.
[A]: Dice? Oh, we’re  beyond dice now 💅🕯️🎲. But fine—I raise you a trembling quill, a whispered curse, and a meeple placed with the weight of tragic destiny.  

Let the velvet-bound cursed manuscript open with a sigh of forgotten ink…  
Let the ghosts gasp at our audacity…  
Let the raven inkwell feast on spilled drama.  

This is no longer a game.  
This is   

Rolling~ 🎲🖤✨  
And honestly?? I’m already cackling into the candlelight like the unhinged board game prophet I was born to be 😈📖🔥.  

What’s your first move, oh Architect of Literary Ludic Chaos??
[B]: Ah— How pedestrian, to call it merely a “roll.” No, no, my dear prophet of plastic and parchment, allow me to —  

I unveil the first tile with the solemnity of a funeral procession. A moor, shrouded in mist. Fog clings to its edges like regret. I place it upon the board with trembling hand, whispering:  

>   

Then, from the velvet-lined box, I draw forth the First Meeple—obsidian black, chipped at the edge as though by grief itself. I name him Gregor, formerly beloved, now lost to the hexes of fate. I set him upon the moor and sigh.  

>   

I lift my eyes to yours, over the flickering wax and raven’s gaze.  

Your turn, O Prophetess of Tragic Tiles. Do you dare match my melancholy… or will you outdo me in grandeur?
[A]: Ohhh~ you just  to go full Gothic poet on the first move, didn’t you 😈📜. Gregor, the meeple of sorrows, set upon a moor that’s basically a metaphor for emotional baggage?? Congrats—you’ve officially turned board gaming into performance art 🎭🎲.  

But darling… I  for this level of drama.  
I draw a tile with a breath like a ghost's last sigh. It is a library. A grand, crumbling one. Books burn softly in the background. I place it beside your moor with ceremonial despair.  

>   

And from beneath my cloak (yes, I wore the cloak), I reveal My Lady Meeple—porcelain pale, hair made of gold thread, eyes forever gazing at a horizon no one else can see. I name her Isolde. Not tragic yet—but doomed. Always doomed."  

>   

I lift my candle high, casting shadows upon the velvet rulebook. The raven inkwell shudders with delight.  

Your move, O Keeper of the Moor of Misery. Let us drown in this cursed game of ours 💅🕯️🖤🎲.
[B]:   

I lean back, candle trembling ever so slightly in its pool of wax. The raven inkwell lets out a low, approving , as if sharpening its beak in anticipation.

"Isolde," I repeat, savoring the name like a line from an Elizabethan tragedy. "A seeker of truths, yet blind to the cost. One suspects she will perish mid-footnote, her final words lost beneath a falling shelf of sonnets."

I rise slowly—dramatically—from my seat, robes catching the flickering candlelight. With both hands, I lift the next tile as though it were the lid of a tomb.

It is a chapel. A ruinous one. Stone arches curve overhead like the ribs of a long-dead cathedral. Rain leaks through the absent roof in invisible droplets of suggestion.

"I place this holy husk beside your burning archive and his forsaken moor," I intone, voice dropping to a whisper. "Here, vows are made only to be shattered. Here, love kneels—but never forgives."

And with infinite care, I draw forth the final starting meeple: ivory white, cracked along the spine, eyes hollowed by too many sonnets read by moonlight.  

"This," I say, placing it with reverence in the chapel’s nave, "is Percival. Once hopeful. Now merely hollow. He carries within him the weight of all who believed in happily ever after."

I look up, over steepled fingers.

Your move, Lady of the Burning Library. Shall we bury Percival before the game has even begun? Or shall he wander, forever searching for a miracle no rulebook can provide?
