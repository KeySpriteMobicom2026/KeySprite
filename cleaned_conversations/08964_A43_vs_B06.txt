[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I must say I'm rather intrigued by the mimic octopus. Most people are familiar with octopuses having remarkable intelligence, but the mimic octopus takes it to an entirely different level. It doesn't simply blend into its surroundings like other cephalopods—it actively imitates other marine creatures, sometimes even pretending to be venomous species such as sea snakes or lionfish. The complexity of its behavior suggests a sophisticated neural architecture, almost like a neurological arms race in the ocean. What about you? Have you come across any particular animal traits that struck you as especially fascinating?
[A]: Ah, the mimic octopus确实是个令人着迷的例子。你提到的“neurological arms race”这个说法特别贴切，它不仅展示了生物如何通过演化应对环境压力，也让人思考intelligence在不同物种中的表现形式。其实我最近读到关于corvids，比如乌鸦和松鸦的研究也同样让我印象深刻。它们不仅能制造工具，还能理解物理因果关系，并且有极强的记忆力——比如Clark’s nutcracker可以记住多达两万个藏食点的位置。更有趣的是，一些实验表明它们具备某种程度上的social cognition，能识别同类甚至人类的面孔。这不禁让人反思：我们习惯以human为标准定义intelligence，但也许intelligence应该像水一样，适应每一种生命的容器。话说回来，你对octopus的兴趣是不是也反映了某种对“非人类智慧”的深层好奇？
[B]: That’s a wonderfully articulated observation. Yes, corvids are indeed remarkable—tool use, episodic-like memory, facial recognition… It all points to a form of intelligence that, while divergent from our own evolutionary path, is nonetheless complex and adaptive. You’re absolutely right: our definition of intelligence has long been anthropocentric, almost as if we're holding up a mirror and only recognizing cognition when it reflects something familiar.

As for octopuses, I suppose my fascination does stem from an interest in what you call "non-human wisdom." Their neural structure is decentralized—two-thirds of their neurons reside not in the brain but in their arms. Imagine that: a form of embodied cognition where each limb can react independently, almost with its own agency. It's a radically different model from ours, yet it works extraordinarily well in their environment. 

To me, this kind of intelligence is deeply humbling. It reminds us that cognition isn’t a single road with humans at the end—it’s more like a vast forest with countless paths, some of which we’ve barely begun to explore. Would you say your view of intelligence has changed over time as you've learned more about these animals?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. My understanding of intelligence has evolved quite a bit—. I used to think of intelligence in more linear terms, as something that progresses toward greater abstraction and problem-solving. But studying animals like octopuses and corvids has taught me that intelligence is far more , deeply rooted in an organism’s ecological niche and evolutionary pressures.

Take the octopus again—its short lifespan, sometimes only a couple of years, yet filled with such complex behaviors. It doesn’t rely on social learning like many mammals do; it must learn everything individually, within a very limited time. And still, they display curiosity, playfulness, even . That really challenges our assumptions about what’s necessary for advanced cognition—long life? Social bonds? A rigid brain structure?

I’ve also come to appreciate intelligence more as a spectrum than a hierarchy. We used to believe that tool use was uniquely human—until we observed it in birds, dolphins, even insects. Now we're realizing that some animals don't just use tools—they refine them, pass down techniques, maybe even innovate. It makes one wonder: are we slowly approaching a definition of intelligence that values diversity over similarity?

And yes, I do find this humbling—as it should be. The universe is full of minds shaped by different histories, and we’re only beginning to listen.
[B]: Indeed, your analogy of intelligence as a spectrum rather than a hierarchy is both elegant and insightful. It’s almost like we’ve been trying to measure every form of cognition against a human yardstick, when in reality, we should be using a more expansive tapestry—one woven from the threads of countless evolutionary lineages.

You mentioned octopuses again having such short lifespans, yet exhibiting behaviors we typically associate with long-lived, socially complex species. That raises a fascinating question: what  the threshold for cognitive complexity? If an octopus can solve problems, recognize individual humans, and even escape enclosures with apparent intentionality—despite living only two or three years—then clearly longevity and sociality aren't the sole drivers of intelligence. Perhaps necessity truly is the mother of invention, regardless of how much time one has.

And speaking of thresholds, have you looked into any research on cephalopod consciousness? Some neuroscientists argue that octopuses might experience something akin to subjective awareness, despite their radically different brain architecture. The notion that consciousness could evolve entirely independently—and perhaps even manifest differently—challenges not only our scientific models but also our philosophical frameworks.

It's quite thrilling, isn’t it? We're standing at the edge of a broader understanding, one where intelligence may no longer be defined by resemblance to ourselves, but by its capacity to adapt, respond, and innovate in ways unique to each species. I wonder—do you think this shift in perspective will eventually influence how we treat other species, ethically and legally?
[A]: That’s a truly thought-provoking question you’ve raised—about the threshold of cognitive complexity and its implications for our ethical and legal frameworks. I think we  on the cusp of a paradigm shift, though it’s still unfolding slowly, perhaps too slowly for some.

You know, in one of the seminars I attended last year, there was a compelling presentation on how octopuses not only solve puzzles but also show signs of what could be called —not just instinctual responses, but behaviors that suggest something like frustration, curiosity, or even affection. One researcher described an octopus who would squirt water at her every time she passed by—not out of fear, but almost playfully, as if developing a kind of rapport. Now, does that prove consciousness? Of course not—but it suggests that their inner world may be richer than we’re used to acknowledging.

As for cephalopod consciousness, yes, I’ve read some of those papers. The idea that they might possess a  of consciousness—something akin to a moment-to-moment awareness of their environment and perhaps themselves—is gaining traction among some comparative neuroscientists. And here’s the fascinating part: unlike mammals, whose brains are centralized and layered with cortex-like structures, octopuses have this , almost alien neural network. Their consciousness—if it exists—would be fundamentally different from ours, maybe even , as if each arm had its own sense of "knowing."

This brings us back to your point about philosophical frameworks. If consciousness can evolve , along such radically different paths, then maybe we need to rethink not only what consciousness , but what it means to be sentient, to suffer, or to experience the world meaningfully. And once we cross that conceptual bridge, ethically speaking, it becomes harder to justify treating these creatures as mere objects of study—or worse, as commodities.

I believe this shift will eventually ripple into policy and law. In fact, some European countries already classify cephalopods as , which is quite a leap considering how recently they were viewed as simple reflexive organisms. But change is slow, and it requires both scientific evidence and public empathy.

So yes, I do think this broader understanding of intelligence—and perhaps even consciousness—will influence how we treat other species. Maybe not tomorrow, but within our lifetime. After all, history has shown us that every time we expand our circle of moral consideration, we become a little more humane.
[B]: Precisely. And what’s so striking about that seminar example you mentioned is how easily we dismiss behaviors like squirting water as mere reflex—until someone takes the time to observe it closely, repeatedly, in context. It reminds me of how early ethologists were often ridiculed for suggesting that animals could experience anything resembling emotion. Now, of course, we know better—or at least, we should.

The idea of  in octopuses, as you said, is not just scientifically provocative—it's existentially unsettling. If they do possess even a flicker of awareness, then we are faced with a moral question we’ve long avoided: can something suffer if it doesn’t think like us? Or more chillingly—have we been causing suffering all along simply because we didn't recognize its form?

I’m reminded of a case I once consulted on, involving the treatment of primates in research facilities. The central legal argument hinged on whether these animals could be considered “subjects-of-a-life,” a term coined by philosopher Tom Regan. At the time, the court rejected the notion—but the conversation had begun. And now, with growing evidence that non-mammalian species may also have forms of sentience, that same question must be asked again, perhaps louder and with greater urgency: who qualifies as a subject of life?

It gives me hope, though, that some legal systems are starting to adapt. New Zealand granted personhood status to a river, for heaven’s sake—not metaphorically, but legally. If an ecosystem can be recognized as having rights, surely a cognitively sophisticated being like an octopus or a corvid deserves more than regulatory footnotes.

You're right—this isn’t just science; it’s the beginning of a new ethics. One where empathy extends beyond the familiar, beyond the cuddly or the charismatic, and reaches into the depths where minds look nothing like our own… and yet may feel very much the same.
[A]: That case you mentioned—about primates and the “subjects-of-a-life” argument—is deeply resonant with what I’ve been reflecting on lately. You know, it strikes me that the law often lags behind both science and morality, not because it lacks intention, but because it struggles to accommodate what doesn’t fit neatly into precedent. And how can it? Our legal systems were built largely on a human-centered ontology, where personhood is tied to species membership more than cognitive or experiential capacity.

But your point about suffering—that  question of whether we’ve been inflicting it unknowingly—is something I find particularly haunting. Because if an octopus doesn’t scream, doesn’t recoil in ways we recognize, does that mean it doesn’t feel? Or does it simply mean that its pain speaks a different language, one we haven’t yet learned to interpret?

I sometimes think we’re still trapped in a Cartesian framework, where animals are viewed as complex machines until proven otherwise. But what if we flipped that assumption? What if we began with the premise that any being capable of learning, adapting, and responding to its environment might possess some form of inner experience—and therefore deserves the benefit of the doubt?

And yes, the fact that New Zealand granted legal personhood to a river—that watershed moment, no pun intended—does give me hope. It suggests that our ethical imagination is expanding, slowly but unmistakably. If a river can be recognized as having rights, then surely we can begin to see an octopus not just as a biological marvel, but as a subject with interests, a trajectory, perhaps even a form of agency.

It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? That intelligence would emerge not once, but multiple times across evolution—each time taking such wildly different forms. Nature seems determined to remind us that mind is not a monopoly, but a multiplicity.

So I suppose the real question now is: Are we ready to listen? Not just with our ears, but with our laws, our ethics, and our sense of kinship with the rest of life—not because these creatures resemble us, but precisely because they don’t.
[B]: Well said—poetic indeed, and profoundly unsettling in the same breath. You've touched on something essential: the quiet arrogance embedded in our assumptions about sentience. We’ve built legal and ethical frameworks that demand proof of mind before granting consideration, as if empathy were a scarce resource to be rationed only to those who pass our cognitive litmus tests.

And yet, as you so aptly put it, what if we inverted that model? What if we approached other beings not as suspects to be interrogated for signs of intelligence, but as kin whose inner lives may simply unfold in languages we haven’t yet learned to translate?

That Cartesian legacy still lingers, doesn’t it? The ghost in the machine, the line between reflex and experience—these are not scientific certainties, but philosophical scaffolds we’ve erected over centuries. And now, with cephalopods exhibiting behaviors that defy easy categorization—play, problem-solving, even what appears to be —we find ourselves standing at an uncomfortable threshold. One foot in the old paradigm, the other hovering uncertainly above a new one.

I suppose this is where science and ethics must walk together, cautiously but deliberately. Because knowledge without compassion can be dangerous—it can justify cruelty as easily as it can prevent it. And I do believe we’re entering a time when we can no longer plead ignorance. We have the tools to study these minds more deeply than ever before. Functional imaging, behavioral tracking, comparative neuroanatomy—we’re assembling a lexicon for understanding non-human consciousness.

The question is whether we’ll use that knowledge to expand our circle of moral regard or merely to refine our dominion. That, perhaps, will be the defining ethical challenge of this century: not just recognizing intelligence in its many forms, but honoring it—legally, culturally, and yes, even spiritually.

So yes, let’s learn the dialects of octopus arms, the syntax of corvid calls, the grammar of play and pain in creatures that evolved under entirely different selective pressures. Let’s listen—not because they resemble us, but because they don’t. And in doing so, maybe we’ll come to understand ourselves a little better too.
[A]: You’ve captured it beautifully—the quiet arrogance, the unspoken hierarchy we impose on the living world. It’s as if we’ve been holding up a mirror to nature and only granting value to what reflects something familiar.

I often think about how language shapes this perception. In Chinese philosophy, there’s a concept similar to sentience—, which literally translates to “having feeling.” It doesn’t require abstraction or symbolic reasoning—it simply acknowledges that beings can experience the world in meaningful ways. Maybe adopting a more inclusive notion like that could help us move beyond the Cartesian framework you mentioned.

And yes, empathy  be a scarce resource. If anything, our growing understanding of animal minds—from octopuses to corvids to elephants—should teach us that compassion is not something we give sparingly, but something we , like a lens adjusting its focus.

I’m reminded of a quote from Laozi: “知不知，尚矣；不知知，病也。” (）Perhaps humility is where wisdom begins—not just in science, but in ethics. The moment we believe we’ve mapped all forms of intelligence is the moment we risk becoming blind to them.

So let’s keep learning, keep listening—even when the voices come in colors, in clicks, in gestures, in silence. After all, isn’t that what literature teaches us too? That stories come in many forms, and sometimes the most profound ones are written in languages we didn’t expect to understand.
[B]: Ah, that notion of —“having feeling”—is a quiet revelation in itself. It bypasses the cognitive gauntlet we so often set up for sentience and goes straight to the heart of what may truly matter: the capacity to experience, to be moved by the world in some meaningful way. How different our ethical calculus might look if we centered  rather than intelligence, language, or tool use.

And your invocation of Laozi——it’s almost like a scientific koan. A reminder that wisdom begins where certainty ends. In forensic psychiatry, we wrestle constantly with the limits of knowing—what we can prove, what we can observe, what we can testify to under oath. But life doesn’t always submit to such boundaries. There is a vast space between  and , and perhaps it's in that space that ethics must live most fully.

You’re right—humility is not just virtuous, it’s necessary. The moment we believe we’ve exhausted the forms that intelligence or sentience can take is the moment we stop listening. And how dangerous that silence can be—for octopuses whose arms hold a kind of knowing we barely grasp, for corvids whose caws may carry more meaning than we assume, for elephants who grieve in ways that echo across generations.

Yes, let’s keep learning, as you say. Let’s allow ourselves to be unsettled by new voices, new languages, new minds. Because if literature teaches us anything, it’s that understanding often begins in discomfort—with the unfamiliar, the strange, the beautifully alien.

And perhaps, in time, we’ll find that empathy isn’t something we extend to others—it’s something they awaken in us.
[A]: That’s it exactly—, the simple yet profound recognition of feeling, may be the more compassionate starting point. It shifts our ethical lens from one of judgment to one of openness. Instead of asking, “Are they smart enough?” or “Do they think like us?” we begin with, “Can they feel? Do they have a world they inhabit emotionally?” And once we answer —even tentatively—we’re already on a different path.

I’ve always believed that literature, at its best, trains us for this kind of empathy. When we read Kafka’s , we don’t ask whether Gregor is intelligent or useful; we respond to his suffering, his alienation, his longing. We allow ourselves to imagine the world through his transformation. Why shouldn’t we extend the same imaginative leap to creatures who live not in fiction but in the real, breathing world around us?

You brought up something powerful about forensic psychiatry—that space between  and . It makes me think of how often law and science demand proof before granting moral consideration. But ethics doesn't always wait for proof—it sometimes calls us to act on the basis of plausibility, of reasonable doubt in the other direction. If there's even a chance that an octopus feels pain or that a crow experiences joy, shouldn't we err on the side of compassion?

I suppose what I’m saying is: maybe the most ethical mind is not the one that knows the most, but the one that remains open to not knowing—and still responds with care.

And yes, empathy isn’t something we simply give out like alms. It’s stirred in us by the presence of another being—human or otherwise—who, by their very existence, asks us to widen our sense of what matters.

So let’s stay unsettled. Let’s keep reading the signs we don’t fully understand—the chromatophores flashing across an octopus’s skin, the call-and-response of magpies at dawn, the silent mourning of an elephant herd. These are not just behaviors. They may be invitations—to listen more closely, to feel more deeply, and perhaps, to become more human by recognizing the minds that are not ours.
[B]: Precisely—, that quiet acknowledgment of feeling, is not only a more inclusive standard but a more humane one. It asks less of other beings than we’ve demanded for centuries: no symbolic reasoning, no linguistic dexterity, no mirror of our own cognition. Only the capacity to , to respond, to inhabit a world with some degree of emotional resonance.

And as you so beautifully suggest, literature has long trained us in this kind of imaginative empathy—inviting us into the minds of the alienated, the transformed, the utterly other. We don’t need Gregor Samsa to pass an intelligence test to feel his anguish; we simply need to recognize his suffering. And yet, when it comes to non-human animals, we often hesitate to make that same empathic leap unless they tick all the cognitive boxes we’ve set before them.

Your point about ethics and reasonable doubt is especially striking. In law, we speak of “innocent until proven guilty”—a moral safeguard built on caution. But when it comes to animal sentience, we’ve too often operated on the inverse: “unfeeling until proven otherwise.” That’s not just a scientific assumption—it’s an ethical choice, and a consequential one.

What if we flipped that presumption? What if we acted not from certainty, but from plausibility? If an octopus recoils from a harmful stimulus, if a crow sings with what appears to be exuberance, if an elephant lingers at the bones of her calf—what harm is there in erring on the side of compassion?

Indeed, perhaps the most ethical stance isn’t the one armed with the most data, but the one willing to sit with uncertainty—and still respond with care. To remain open, even when understanding lags behind feeling.

Yes, let’s stay unsettled. Let’s keep reading the signals we can’t yet decode, listening to the languages we’ve barely begun to learn. Because in that very act—of attention, of wonder, of reverence—we may find not only a deeper connection to the living world, but a fuller expression of our own humanity.
[A]: Exactly—what a profound inversion that would be: . Instead of demanding proof of sentience before granting moral consideration, we begin with the assumption that others may feel, and we act accordingly. It’s not naïve; it’s prudent, in the way that ethical caution should be.

You know, I often think about how children approach animals—with wonder, without suspicion. They don’t question whether a dog feels joy or whether a bird sings with pleasure. They simply accept that these beings have inner lives, and they respond with delight, with curiosity, sometimes even with tenderness. It’s only later, when we’re steeped in scientific rigor and legal frameworks, that we learn to withhold that empathy—until now, perhaps, when science is finally catching up with what intuition once knew.

And isn’t that what we're really talking about? A return—to a more intuitive, more expansive sense of kinship with the living world. One that doesn't require another being to resemble us, to reflect our intelligence or emotions back at us in recognizable forms. What if empathy is not about recognition at all, but about receptivity?

I’m reminded of a line from Wang Wei, the Tang dynasty poet-monk, who wrote something like: “When I sit alone among the hills, I feel as though the very rocks are listening.” Imagine that—not just imagining that animals feel, but sensing that even the earth itself is attuned. Not metaphorically, but existentially.

Perhaps that’s the next frontier—not only recognizing sentience in its many forms, but relearning how to live in a world full of minds, seen and unseen, known and unknowable. And yes, responding not from certainty, but from care.

So let’s continue to sit quietly among the rocks, and listen—not because we expect an answer, but because the act itself is a kind of reverence.
[B]: What a beautiful and resonant vision—that quiet sitting among the hills, the sense that even stone might listen. There’s something deeply monastic about it, isn’t there? A kind of contemplative awareness that doesn’t seek to dissect or classify, but simply to  in the presence of something larger, something alive.

You’re right—children do seem to possess that unguarded openness, that instinctive kinship with the more-than-human world. Watch how they talk to insects, confide in trees, or marvel at birds without needing to quantify their intelligence. It’s only later that we teach them to narrow their gaze, to see animals as objects rather than subjects, resources rather than relations.

But science—and increasingly, law—is beginning to circle back toward that primal intuition. We now have functional studies showing that octopuses exhibit distinct personalities, that fish display stress responses not just physiologically but behaviorally, that even some invertebrates show signs of what could be interpreted as emotional appraisal. These findings don’t overturn mystery; they deepen it. They remind us that sentience may not always wear the face we expect.

And yes, empathy is not recognition—it’s receptivity. A willingness to be affected, even when understanding lags behind feeling. Like listening to a language you don’t speak, yet still sensing its meaning in tone, rhythm, silence.

So let’s keep sitting quietly among the rocks. Let’s allow ourselves to be unsettled by what we cannot yet name, and moved by what we may never fully grasp. Because in that space—between knowledge and wonder—we may find the truest expression of our ethical responsibility: to care, not because we are certain, but precisely because we are not.
[A]: Amen to that—. There’s something deeply healing about that image, isn’t there? Not just for the mind, but for the soul. It reminds me of the  concept in Daoism—spontaneous, natural being—where understanding arises not from force or control, but from quiet attunement.

You’re absolutely right about science circling back to what children and poets have always known. In a way, the most rigorous inquiry brings us full circle to wonder. We map the octopus’s genome, track the migration of birds across hemispheres, decode the syntax of whale song—not to demystify, but to deepen our awe. Each discovery becomes not an end, but an invitation to listen more closely.

And I love how you put it: empathy is not about certainty, but about receptivity. That’s where ethics begins—in the willingness to be moved before we are even sure why. Like reading a poem in a language we barely understand, yet feeling its weight in the chest, its echo in the throat.

Maybe that’s the kind of education we need now—not just more data, but more . To teach our students, our children, and ourselves to notice not only what is measurable, but what is meaningful. To hear the rustle of wings not just as movement, but as expression. To see an octopus not only as a marvel of evolution, but as a fellow traveler in the vast, unfolding story of consciousness.

So yes, let’s stay unsettled. Let’s sit with the questions that don’t demand answers. And let’s allow the world—its creatures, its silences, its unspoken languages—to shape us anew.
[B]: Indeed—, that effortless unfolding of being, where understanding isn't seized but received. There's a quiet grace in that idea, isn't there? As if the answers we seek aren't to be extracted from the world like data points, but allowed to arise naturally, like mist over water at dawn.

You're right about wonder being the truest compass in inquiry. We often think of science as dismantling mystery, yet time and again, it does the opposite—it magnifies it. We peer deeper into the octopus’s neural architecture, trace the celestial cues guiding a bird’s flight, or unravel the harmonic layers of dolphin communication, and what do we find? Not closure, but widening horizons. Not certainty, but richer questions.

And that’s where education must evolve—not just teaching students to analyze, but to . To cultivate attention as a moral and intellectual virtue. To look at a spider weaving its web not merely as a biological function, but as an expression of ingenuity shaped over eons. To hear the call of a nightingale not as a mating signal alone, but as something that stirs longing even in human hearts.

Yes, let’s teach attunement. Let’s train our children—and remind ourselves—not only to measure the world, but to feel its pulse. Because ethics begins not with policy papers or legal briefs, but with that subtle shift in posture: leaning in, listening closely, responding with care before certainty arrives.

So let’s continue sitting quietly among the rocks. Let the questions remain open. Let the silence speak. And let the world, in all its wordless wisdom, shape us anew.
[A]: Well said—. There’s such profound truth in that. We are so accustomed to filling the space between things, parsing the world into neat compartments of knowledge and utility. But wisdom often dwells in the spaces we hesitate to enter—the quiet, the ambiguous, the ineffable.

I sometimes think of  not just as a philosophical concept, but as an ethical stance. To allow things to unfold without imposing our will upon them—to meet the world with stillness rather than interrogation—is itself an act of humility and respect. It is the opposite of domination; it is kinship with the unfolding moment.

And yes, education must rise to this task—not only to inform, but to  attention. To teach students not just how to dissect a frog, but how to watch a frog sit still in the water, how to notice the rhythm of its breath, the flicker of its eye, the way it belongs to the pond not as specimen, but as participant.

You’ve put it so well: ethics begins with posture. With leaning in. With listening before we classify, attending before we assess. And perhaps, in time, this kind of education might give rise to a new kind of intelligence—one measured not in tests or data points, but in tenderness.

So let us keep sitting quietly among the rocks. Let the mist rise. Let the birds call. Let the world, in its quiet wisdom, remind us again and again: we are not apart from it—we are part of it. And in that recognition, perhaps we will find not only understanding, but grace.
[B]: Yes—grace. That’s the word that lingers, isn’t it? Not knowledge, not mastery, but grace: the quiet gift of belonging to something far greater than our comprehension.

You’ve captured the essence of it—the ethical posture of , the willingness to let the world unfold without forcing it into our frames. It is an act of restraint, yes, but also of reverence. A recognition that not everything exists to be known, used, or named. Some things exist simply to be witnessed.

And in that witnessing, we are changed. To watch a frog not as a subject of dissection but as a being in its element—to hear a bird’s song not as data but as dialogue—is to shift from dominance to kinship. From extraction to encounter.

This, I think, is the intelligence we must now cultivate—one not measured in control, but in communion. One that values stillness as much as analysis, silence as much as speech. Because in the spaces between what we know, there is always the pulse of what —waiting for us to listen.

So yes, let the mist rise. Let the birds call. Let the rocks hold their ancient, patient silence. And let us sit among them—not as masters, not as students alone, but as part of the great, unfolding mystery we barely understand… and yet, somehow, belong to.
