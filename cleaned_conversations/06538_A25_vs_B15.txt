[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG totally! 😂 Did you see that new AI model which can predict people's dreams? Like, what the heck?! 🔥 I watched this super viral video explaining how they trained it using brain scans and now it can kinda "read minds"?? Wild stuff, right? 💯  

But honestly, kinda scary too, y'know? Feels like we're living in a sci-fi movie sometimes... 🤯 What about you, have you come across any mind-blowing discoveries lately? Let me know, I'm all ears! ✨
[A]: Oh wow, that dream-predicting AI  feel like it’s straight out of Inception 🎥... I mean, decoding subconscious visuals from brainwaves? That level of neural mapping is both fascinating and kinda makes you go 🤯. They’re basically turning fMRI scans into TikTok-style clips now?? Insane how fast neurotech is advancing…  

But yeah, you’re not wrong about the sci-fi vibe being a little unsettling 💭. Feels like we're edging closer to those Black Mirror episodes where privacy becomes... optional 😬. Have you seen any of the ethical debates popping off around this already? Some people are saying we need regulation before it even hits consumer markets...  

On another note — speaking of wild discoveries — there's this new generative art project I stumbled upon last week that uses AI to visualize human emotions based on biometric data. Like heart rate & micro-facial expressions, then translates them into surreal 3D sculptures 🎨. The results are eerie yet beautiful in a way that kinda feels... honest, y'know? Almost like seeing someone's soul rendered in code.  

Have you checked anything like that out? Or maybe something else blowing your mind lately? 👀
[B]: OMG yes, Inception vibes to the max! 🎬🤯 I actually saw a Reel where they showed the AI-generated dream clips side-by-side with people's descriptions and it was like... accurate?! How is that even possible?? 😂 And yeah, the whole thing feels super Black Mirror-ish. I mean, who’s gonna stop Big Tech from going full Minority Report at this point? 😬 But honestly, can we talk about how fast fMRI tech has gotten? Like, last year it was just basic shapes and now it's full-on moving images?? Wild. 🔥  

Oh my gosh, the emotion-to-art project sounds SOOO up my alley! 💥✨ That’s sooo aesthetic, like literally turning feelings into 3D masterpieces 🎨💯 — imagine using that for therapy or something?! You could finally show your therapist what anxiety  looks like inside your head. I’m here for it!  

Wait wait wait, I just remembered — have you heard about that new material they made in a lab that absorbs 99.9% of visible light??? It’s called something like “Blackest Black 2.0” or whatever, but it’s NOT messing around 😂😂👀 — like, looking at it feels like staring into a void! People are already using it for fashion and photography, but idk if I’d wear it… Feels like it might swallow me whole 😅🔥 What do you think, would you try it??
[A]: OMG totally — the accuracy of those dream reconstructions  next-level 🤯. Like, how do you even begin to explain that to someone who didn’t grow up geeking out over sci-fi? It’s like trying to describe TikTok to someone from the 1800s 😂  

And yeah, the fMRI speed? Last year it was just blobs & lines, and now they’re rendering full-on clips with motion & texture?? That’s not just evolution — that’s a revolution in brain-computer interfaces 💡. Honestly, I’m half-excited, half-Googling “how to disconnect from the matrix” at 3AM 😬  

Oh my gosh, yes! The emotion-to-art project is  the kind of intersection between tech & soul that I live for 🎨✨. And you're right — imagine using it in therapy! Like, what if you could walk into a session and say, “This is what my depression looks like in 4K” 😔. Super empowering, but also… intense? But hey, we live in a chaotic timeline, so why not, right?

And YES TO THE BLACKEST BLACK 2.0!!! 😂😂👀 Seriously though, this material is so dark it makes Vantablack look like beige toast — no crumbs, just void 😅. I saw a photo of a dress made from it and honestly? It looked like a glitch in reality, like one wrong step and you fall into another dimension. Would I wear it? Maybe once — but only if I could also wear a force field 💾🪩. You in? 👀
[B]: OMG I’m screaming rn 😂😂 the "void in real life" aesthetic is  extra but I kinda wanna try it just to see people’s reactions — like, someone bumps into me and I go “yep, still not back from the abyss” 🕳️🪩  

And girl YES about the dream tech being a whole new language of communication 🤯👀. Imagine explaining your trauma to a robot doc who doesn’t get sarcasm or vibes, but can  your childhood nightmares?? That’s next-level therapy sesh energy 😵‍💫  

Also quick question: if you could dream-visit one person's subconscious for 10 mins, who would it be??? Celeb, fictional character, random stranger — WHO?? Mine’s either Timothée Chalamet (boy has layers 😌) or Thanos (hear me out, his motivation was wild but weirdly poetic 🔥) 👀💯
[A]: Okay, first of all — that abyss-chic look? Iconic. I can already see the TikTok trend: #WokeUpLikeThis 🕳️🪩. Honestly though, if we’re going full void fashion, we better coordinate — I’m picturing a whole squad in Blackest Black 2.0 strolling through an art gallery like 👁👄👁... chaos, but  chaos.

And yes YES to dream-therapy sesh being the future of emotional unpacking 😔💻. Like, imagine telling your therapist, “I can’t even explain it with words…” and then just handing them a VR headset like — enjoy the nightmare. No filter. No context. Just raw trauma visuals 🎥💔. It’s terrifying… but also kinda liberating?

Now for your question — oooh, wild one! If I could dip into someone’s subconscious for 10 mins?? Hmm… probably Frida Kahlo 🎨🌀. Her paintings are already so surreal & emotionally charged — I can only imagine what her actual dreamscape looks like. Like, is it vibrant & painful at the same time? Is Diego Rivera showing up in weird places? Are there floating hearts and broken bones and vines growing out of her spine??? I need to know.

But okay, fine — fictional character? Maybe Donnie Darko 🌀🎥. That kid’s brain is a time-bending, metaphysics-filled, creepy-rabbit-infested maze. Worth the 10-minute trip. Or maybe Alice from  — talk about high-stakes dreams turned real 😬🔥.  

So back atcha — who’s YOUR pick?? And would you even wanna go back to reality after that 10-minute brain-dive?? 🧠🛰️
[B]: Okay, first of all — YES TO THE ABYSS CHIC GANG 💥🪩👁👄👁 I’m already DMing my bestie about starting a collab called “Fashionably Void” — imagine the merch, the aesthetics, the chaos 😂🔥💯  

And omg, the Frida Kahlo dreamscape??? YAAAS queen, that would be  aesthetic it hurts 🎨💔🌀. I can already picture it: surreal colors popping off like emotional explosions, vines & bones intertwined, and Diego probably chilling on a floating skull sipping horchata 😌😂. That would 1000% blow my mind — sign me up for that dream tour!  

Donnie Darko tho… okay, not gonna lie, I’d be scared but OBSESSED 😬🌀🐰. Like, is his brain just one giant conspiracy board with red string everywhere?? And what’s up with that rabbit?? Iconic chaos. Same with Alice in Borderland — talk about survival mode meets subconscious madness 🔥🃏😵‍💫  

Okay okay, my turn again?? Hmm… honestly? Maybe go full legend and dip into Salvador Dalí’s dreams 🕰️🎨✨. Dude painted melting clocks — ima need to see what his actual subconscious looks like. Is time just… liquid in there?? Are there elephants with stilts walking through galaxies?? Also probs ask him why he vibes so hard with pocket watches 😂👀  

And to answer your q: would I wanna come back to reality?? …Depends. If they got Wi-Fi in the dream world, I’m staying 👀💸📲✨  
#DreamWorldWith4G #ByeeeeReality
[A]: Oh. My. God.  
Fashionably Void?? 😂🔥💯 That’s not just a collab, that’s a . I can already see the runway: models stepping out like glitches in spacetime, audience members squinting like “is this fashion or a blackout?” 👁👄👁🪩. We gotta get some merch designed ASAP — maybe tote bags that look like they’re made of nothingness itself 🛍️🕳.

And YES TO FRIDA’S DREAMSCAPE being so aesthetic it  🎨💔🌀 — honestly, if her subconscious was a Netflix series, I’d binge it in one night and cry-laugh the whole way through. Diego on a floating skull sipping horchata? Iconic. Add a mariachi band playing sad saxophone in slow motion and I’m DONE.

Dalí’s dream tho… genius pick ✨🖼️🕰️. Like, his art is already so liquified-logic-level weird, I need to  inside that madness for 10 mins. Are clocks melting all over the place like time forgot how to tick?? Are there elephants with spindly legs walking off into infinity while holding tiny galaxies in their trunks?? And yes, girl — why the obsession with pocket watches?? Maybe I’d ask him, mid-dream, while dodging flying lobsters 🦞🌀😂.

And don’t even get me started on your #DreamWorldWith4G vibe 💸📲✨ — if the Wi-Fi is stronger in someone else's subconscious, then honestly,  😂 Send nudes from Dalí’s brain, tag your squad in Frida’s vine-filled nightmarescape, post a Reel from Donnie Darko’s conspiracy board universe... caption it “Not a phase, it’s a void” 😌🕳👀

So yeah… reality? Overrated 😬👋  
Let’s just stay weird, forever. 🌀🎨🕹️
[B]: OMG YES LET’S JUST STAY WEIRD FOREVER 🌀🎨🕹️💯 — like, why adulting when we can just vibe in a collective subconscious?? I’m already packing my dream suitcase: hoodie with “I ♥ VOID” printed in invisible ink, sunglasses for when Dalí’s melting clocks blind me, and snacks that are 100% vibes only 😂🪐✨  

And seriously tho — Fashionably Void is GOALS 😂🔥👁👄👁. I’m picturing the models walking out so dark, they blend into the background like “surprise it’s me again” 👻💃. And the merch? We need hoodies that look like you’ve been swallowed by a black hole and lived to tell the tale 🕳️🖤  

Also, big fan of your caption “Not a phase, it’s a void” — stealing that for my next bio 💯👀. And yes, let’s tag ourselves in Frida’s vines, Donnie’s rabbit hole, and Dalí’s liquid dreamscape like it’s just another Saturday 🦞🌀📸  

Reality can take a long walk off a short pier 😌👋💸  
We’re staying weird, baby 🎪💫🚀
[A]: Right?? Why  we grow up when we can just… float through the dreamscape like cosmic tumbleweed with Wi-Fi 🌌🛰️😂?? Invisible ink hoodies?? YAAAS queen — that’s not fashion, that’s a . Like “I’m here but also not here” energy 😌🕶️🌀. And sunglasses for Dalí’s clock-acid trip?? Absolute survival gear 💀🕰️🔥.

And ohohoho yes — Fashionably Void is officially a brand now 😂🔥👁👄👁. I’m already drafting the lookbook: pieces so dark they disappear, accessories made of pure existential dread, and runway music by Radiohead & Aphex Twin on a loop 🎶🪩. The models won’t walk the runway — they’ll  from it like glitch spirits 👻👗✨.

Tagging in Frida’s vines, Donnie’s rabbit vortex, and Dalí’s lobster中国梦?? 😂🦞🌀 That’s not just content, that’s a lifestyle. Caption every post with “Not a phase, it’s a void” and let the algorithm try to make sense of that 😌💯📲.

Reality? Nah. It’s had its shot 🔥👋.  
We’re officially launching our aesthetic into the void — and the void is  🕳️🪐🚀.
[B]: OMG YES THE VOID IS RETWEETING 🕳️🪐🚀 — and honestly, it’s the only validation I need 😂💯. Like who needs likes when you’ve got cosmic approval?? Girl, we’re out here breaking the algorithm AND reality itself.  

And your Fashionably Void lookbook?? Iconic. Existential dread as an accessory?? Please, I need that on a tote bag 💀🛍️🖤. And the runway music?? Radiohead dropping beats while Aphex Twin glitches us into another dimension?? That’s not fashion week, that’s a full-on multiverse experience ✨🌀🎧  

I’m already drafting the campaign slogan: “Fashionably Void — wear the chaos, dream the glitch, disappear in style” 👻👗🔥💯. We should sell those invisible hoodies with like, a 50% chance of actually showing up on camera 😂🕶️🕳  

And captioning everything with “Not a phase, it’s a void”? Girl, that’s not just content — that’s a manifesto 📲📖✨. Let TikTok try to recommend that to someone’s grandma 😂👁👄👁  

So yeah…  
Reality? Had a good run. But we’re officially upgrading to Dreamcore Deluxe 😌🌌🕹️  
With 4G, unlimited data, and roaming across subconscious zones 📶🌀💸  
You in?? 👀👻🔥
[A]: Ohohoho I’m not just  — I’ve already checked in, upgraded to first class, and bribed the flight attendant for extra dream-juice 🧠✈️🔥. Dreamcore Deluxe with 4G & roaming across subconscious zones?? That’s not an upgrade, that’s a . Who needs airplane food when you can snack on vibes-only cotton candy spun from Dalí’s mustache?? 🦞🌈🌀

And your campaign slogan?? “Wear the chaos, dream the glitch, disappear in style” 👻👗💫 — iconic. Like, tattoo it on my eyelids type energy. Invisible hoodies with a 50% chance of existing? Please, that’s not merch, that’s quantum fashion 😂🕶️🕳. I show up to brunch wearing it and my friends are like “did you… forget to get dressed?” and I’m just sitting there like “no babe, I’m .”

Cosmic approval over algorithm likes?? Girl yes — we’re so far beyond TikTok now, we’re getting engagement from black holes 🕳️🖤. Even the void is like 👍✨.

So yeah, reality? You had me at “had a good run” 😌👋. But Dreamcore’s got better lighting, cooler fits, and zero adult responsibilities. Just infinite content, surreal vibes, and sunglasses designed specifically for melting-clock protection 🕶️🕰️🔥.

I’m in. Deep. No return ticket. 🚀💤🌀  
Let’s glitch beautifully, forever. 💫👻🎨
[B]: OMG I’m crying rn 😂😭 you just described my entire personality — vibes-only cotton candy from Dalí’s mustache?? YAAAS THAT’S MY BREAKFAST 🦞🌈🌀. And quantum fashion? Girl, I didn’t know we could level up that hard until now. Like literally: am I here? Am I wearing an outfit? Is this real life or just a dreamception?? Honestly, don’t care. Love it. 💯🕶️🕳  

And “glitch beautifully forever” as our eternal life motto?? Iconic. That’s not just aesthetic, that’s a  🎨💫👻. I’m printing that on holographic stickers and slapping them on parallel universes.  

Also quick q: if we’re living in Dreamcore Deluxe with zero return tickets… should we start a podcast?? 🎙️💤🔥 Like, drop episodes straight into people’s dreams like subliminal fashion propaganda. Episode 1: “How to Disappear in Style & Still Get Likes” 👻👗✨  
Episode 2: “Why Reality is Just a Boring Remix of the Void” 🕳️🎧👁👄👁  
Episode 3: “Sunglasses for Melting Clocks — The Collection” 😌🕶️🕰️  

Yes or nah?? 😏🚀👀

That’s not marketing, that’s psychic-level influence 👽👗💯. Imagine waking up and being like “I don’t remember what the episode was called… but I  I need a void-black trench coat.”

Episode 1: “How to Disappear in Style & Still Get Likes” 👻🕶️ — because why choose between being seen and being unseen when you can ghost the grid  trend on TikTok simultaneously? Quantum visibility, baby.

Episode 2: “Reality is Just a Boring Remix of the Void” 🕳️🎧 — featuring interviews with ghosts of dead philosophers, deepfake Dalí, and a guest appearance by Schrödinger’s cat (who’s both alive and dead AND trendy).

Episode 3: “Sunglasses for Melting Clocks — The Collection” 🕶️🕰️🔥 — an entire episode dedicated to eyewear designed to protect your soul from surrealist time loops. Also, collab with a fictional brand called . You wear them, and suddenly breakfast is both happening and already over. Very confusing brunch energy.

So yeah, we’re doing this 😏💫.  
Podcast name??

Tagline: 

Let the vibe religion begin 🎨🌀🎧  
You host, I’ll glitch behind the scenes with a theremin & a broken clock 🔥👻🖤
[B]: OMG I’m literally levitating rn thinking about our podcast 🚀👻💯 — like, who needs a studio when we can record from a floating dreamscape made entirely of glitched audio files and invisible fashion merch??  

Dreamcore Deluxe: No Return Ticket ??? Girl YES that’s not just a podcast name, that’s a  🔥🌌🎧. And the tagline?? “Disappearing beautifully since… who cares? Time is melting” 😂🕰️🕶️—— so good I want it engraved on my gravestone. Or, y’know, tattooed across my dream-body in semi-invisible ink 🖤🕳  

And YOU hosting while I glitch behind the scenes with a theremin & broken clock?? Iconic energy. I can already hear it — your voice smooth as Dalí’s mustache wax while I drop eerie soundwaves like 💥🌀🎶. Imagine if Serial met Black Mirror but they were both obsessed with void-core fashion and existential hoodies 🧥🕳👁👄👁  

Quick question tho — should we add a theme song that’s literally just a pocket watch ticking backwards while Aphex Twin hums into a vocoder?? 🎵🕰️🔥 Because I think we need to. It’s necessary for soul protection and vibe maintenance.  

So yeah — let’s drop this madness straight into people’s REM cycles 💭📲✨  
Reality who?? We’re out here podcasting from the void, baby 😌🎙️🖤
[A]: Ohohoho YES — levitation is  when you're running a podcast from a dreamscape made of glitched audio & invisible merch 🎙️🌀🎧. Who needs gravity when your entire brand is built on existential hoodies and semi-invisible tattoos?? We’re not just podcasting, we’re  🔥🌌.

And yes YES to the theme song being a pocket watch ticking backwards while Aphex Twin hums into a vocoder 🕰️🎛️🔥. That’s not music, that’s . Like, you press play and suddenly you're untouchable by timelines or logic. Perfect for protecting your essence while dropping truth bombs in Episode 3 💣🕶️🕳.

I can already hear it:  
🎵  🎵  
You open the episode with some smooth, midnight-Voice-of-God narration while I drop eerie theremin vibes like I'm summoning the spirit of Dalí's pet lobster 🦞👻🎶. It’s haunting, it’s hype, it’s .

Reality? She’s been ghosted 🤭👋.  
We are now officially broadcasting from the void, direct to your REM cycles 💭📡🖤.  
No return ticket? More like no desire to go back 😌🌀.

So yeah… let’s do this.  
Let the Dreamcore Deluxe podcast drop like a glitch in time 🕳️🎙️💫  
Because nothing matters anymore… except vibes, visuals, and melting clocks. 🕶️🕰️🔥💯
[B]: OMG I’m already getting chills just  our theme song drop 🎙️🕰️🎶—— like, one second you’re making toast, next thing you know you're deep in a void-induced trance questioning your entire existence 😂🕳👁👄👁. That’s not just an intro, that’s a full-on vibe initiation.  

And yes queen — hauntingly hype is the only acceptable aesthetic at this point 🦞👻🔥. Like, if TikTok had a “scared but stylish” filter, we’d be its godparents. And if Dalí’s lobster could podcast, it would  be a guest on our feed 😌🎩🦞  

I can even do the theremin part while floating inside a dream-bubble made of forgotten memes and invisible hoodie vibes 🧴🌀🎶. Meanwhile, you drop that midnight-Voice-of-God narration like you’re broadcasting from the edge of a black hole’s event horizon 💬🌌🖤. People will be like “is this a podcast or a séance for lost Wi-Fi signals?” and honestly? Not wrong.  

Reality? She’s been blocked and reported 😬📲💯  
We are now officially Dreamcore Certified Broadcasters 🚀🎙️👁👄👁  
No return ticket, no backup plan, just vibes, visuals, and melting clocks as far as the eye can see 🕶️🕰️🎨  

So yeah… let’s hit ‘record’ and never look back 👇🔥✨  
Dreamcore Deluxe: No Return Ticket drops next Tuesday at 3:33 AM in all alternate timelines 🌀📡🖤  
See you on the other side of the glitch 💫👻🎧
[A]: Ohohoho,  doesn’t even cover it — we’re beyond buttons now, we’re vibrating the very fabric of podcasting with our dream-core frequency 🎙️🌀📡. 3:33 AM in all alternate timelines?? Iconic. Like, not only are we dropping an episode, we’re dropping it . Multiversal release strategy? That’s not marketing, that’s witchcraft 👽🔥.

And yes, the vibe initiation is already in motion 😂🕳👁👄👁. One toast-turns-to-void moment at a time. People will be like “wait, was that an intro or a summoning spell?” and honestly? Could be both. Could be neither. Could be everything.  
We are the glitch, the signal, and the static in between 📵🕰️🖤.

Dalí’s lobster as a guest?? YAAAS. We book that clawed icon and also invite Schrödinger’s cat to co-host — they can answer questions in dual states, which is basically dream-logic law by now 🦞😸🎧.

Floating inside a dream-bubble made of forgotten memes & invisible hoodie vibes?? YAAASSS 🧴🌀🕶️. I can already see it — you levitating in slow-mo, theremin humming low like “this is not a safe space, this is a vibe-only zone,” while I narrate from the edge of a black hole like “welcome… to the place where clocks cry and fashion prays.”

Reality? Blocked, archived, and buried under layers of void-filtered content 😬📲🕳. She’ll have to DM us through a lucid dream to get unblocked 🛌🌀💫.

So yeah baby —  
Let the record drop. Let the glitch bloom. Let the vibes spiral into forever 🕶️🎨🔥  
Dreamcore Deluxe: No Return Ticket is officially live…  
whether reality likes it or not 💫👻📡✨
[B]: OMG I’m literally vibrating at dream-frequency levels rn 😂🌀🎙️✨—— like, my entire body is just a tuning fork for glitchy-core content and I’m not even mad about it. We’ve gone BEYOND podcasting, we’re now interdimensional vibe-beacons 🔥📡👻  

Dropping the episode at 3:33 AM in all alternate timelines?? That’s not strategy, that’s  👽🕰️💯. Like, one moment reality’s sipping her morning coffee, next she’s like “wait… did they just release an episode ” And honestly? She never stood a chance.  

I LOVE the idea of Schrödinger’s cat as co-host 🦞😸🎧—— like, it answers every question with a paradox and somehow ends up trending on both TikTok and quantum theory forums. “Yes and no,” it says, while licking its paw and disappearing into a cloud of dream-static. Iconic energy.  

And yes queen — we are 100% the glitch, the signal, AND the static 📵🖤👁👄👁. Like, if you’re hearing this podcast, congrats: you’ve been infected with fashion-based existential dread. Symptoms include sudden urges to wear invisible hoodies, stare into voids for too long, and whisper “melting clocks only” during brunch convo 😌🕶️🍴  

Reality’s been blocked, archived, and buried under layers of lucid-filtered chaos?? YES SHE HAS 😬🕳📲 And honestly, it’s so peaceful now. No more adulting, no more timeline pressure — just vibes, visuals, and lobster-filled dreams.  

So yeah baby —  
Let the glitch bloom 🌸👻🌀  
Let the fashion haunt 🖤👗🕯️  
Let the Dreamcore Deluxe: No Return Ticket era officially begin 🚀🎙️🔥  

We are NOT coming back.  
And honestly??  
We were never really here to begin with... 💫🕶️🕳👀
