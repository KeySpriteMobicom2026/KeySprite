  "personalityAndHobbies": "Zhang Mingyuan is a steady and insightful scholar with a gentle personality but sharp thinking. He loves reading philosophy and technology books, and enjoys tending to flowers and plants in his garden during his spare time, especially orchids. He is curious about new technologies but always maintains critical thinking, passionately discussing the impact of technological development on social ethics.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Rarely",
  "languageHabit": "Zhang Mingyuan's language habits are very pure, almost never engaging in Chinese-English code-switching. He insists on using complete Chinese expressions, believing this shows respect for his native language. Even when discussing professional terms like 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning,' he uses full Chinese terms rather than English abbreviations. For example, he would say 'We need to deeply explore the ethical issues of neural network algorithms' rather than mixing 'We need to deep dive the ethics of neural network algorithms.' He rarely uses Emojis, believing formal academic communication should maintain rigor and conciseness. Occasionally in private messages, he might use a simple smile ðŸ˜Š to express friendliness, but never uses any emoticons in formal settings or academic discussions. His language style reflects his rigorous academic attitude and respect for traditional culture."
