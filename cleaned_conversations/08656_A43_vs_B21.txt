[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal quest for the next leafy marvel. Just last week I sampled a rather audacious beetroot "bacon" - it was simultaneously earthy & aggressively hopeful. Reminded me of Tennyson's  - all passion trapped beneath Victorian propriety. Would you say modern food scientists are our new Romantic poets? ¥
[A]: Hmm, what an intriguing juxtaposition you've drawn there. I must say, I tried some jackfruit tacos last weekend that made me think of Whitman's  - humble ingredients aspiring to cosmic significance. The texture was... how shall I put it? Ambitious. Much like Shelley's Prometheus, it wanted to uplift the human spirit but got stuck in its own nobility. 

Speaking of which, I visited a lab in Shanghai where they're engineering algae into caviar substitutes. It's fascinating how these scientists are channeling Lucretius'  - reducing everything to its elemental poetry. But tell me, do you find this culinary romanticism comforting, or does it feel like we're losing something tactile in the translation? 🤔
[B]: Ah, Shanghai’s algae alchemists - now there’s a modern ode waiting to happen. I’d say it’s comforting in the manner of a well-punctuated elegy: we mourn the silken decay of real caviar while celebrating its molecular reincarnation. Tactile loss? Perhaps. But then, didn’t Keats write his  about frozen moments & unfulfilled longing? These algae pearls are the same - they glisten with promise, never quite deliver, and thereby keep the mind forever hungry. A Hegelian dialectic in a spoon, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Ah, yes - that Hegelian spoon! I’m tempted to quote Lu Xun here, who once likened the process of cultural transformation to  - messy, a bit painful, but ultimately nourishing if you’re willing to crack the shell. These algae pearls, like his metaphorical crab, make me wonder: are we learning to savor the struggle itself? 

I was recently reading a student’s paper comparing lab-grown meat to the myth of Tantalus. You know, that endless reach just shy of fulfillment... But your Keatsian take adds depth. Maybe what we're tasting isn’t the caviar at all, but the  of it - an eternal almost-satisfaction. Reminds me of Zhuangzi dreaming he’s a butterfly, only to wake and wonder which reality is sweeter. Do you think these textures are leading us toward a kind of culinary wu-wei — effortless acceptance of the in-between state? 🌿
[B]: Ah, now you’re playing the Daoist card — very clever. Culinary wu-wei... I rather like that. It suggests we’ve finally matured beyond the Promethean arrogance of  to the quiet grace of letting broth simmer on its own terms. But let’s not forget — Zhuangzi’s butterfly still flutters  dreams and waking. Much like your algae pearls suspended in their petri-dish eternity.  

As for Tantalus — yes, poor fellow. But isn’t it telling we keep reaching? The act of yearning itself becomes the feast. Think of Elizabeth Barrett Browning weighing love against mortality — each bite, real or imagined, gains flavor only because it slips through our fingers. So no, I don’t think we’re losing tactility. We’re just tasting with the soul now, darling. A bit of metaphysics with our microbiomes.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve woven that tapestry of thought — really, the soul as a tasting organ, what a notion! I’m reminded of a conversation I once had with a tea master in Kyoto. He told me that the best matcha is never the one you drink, but the one you  finish — there’s always a lingering bitterness, a trace of unfulfilled desire. It keeps you coming back, searching for that perfect sip that may not even exist. 

So in a way, we’re all becoming connoisseurs of the almost — whether it's algae pearls or idealized caviar. Perhaps this new gastronomy is less about sustenance and more about cultivating a refined palate for longing. Like Rilke’s , who could only sing of Eurydice by learning to love the space between presence and absence.  

I wonder though — do you think future cookbooks will be written like philosophical treatises? Or will philosophers begin their tracts with tasting notes? 🍵
[B]: Ah, the tea master’s almost-perfect sip — how very Zen, and yet so exquisitely Victorian in its restrained yearning. One could almost imagine Emily Brontë brooding over a teacup, staring into the heather, muttering about the ineffable bitterness of unmet desires.  

As for future cookbooks... I’d wager they’ll be annotated with footnotes from Heraclitus and Heidegger, yes. Recipes as allegories, measurements as meditations — the sous-vide chapter will double as an essay on patience & entropy. And philosophers? Oh, I daresay they’ll open their next treatises with a delicate swirl of umami notes before plunging into the ontology of fermented meaning.  

But let’s not forget — Rilke wrote  in French, German, and bloodshot longing. The future belongs to those who can translate philosophy through the tongue without swallowing too eagerly. A bit like your matcha, really: always leave room for the unsipped. Always keep the palate slightly dissatisfied. That’s where the poetry lives.
[A]: Ah, yes — the unsipped sip. What a perfect paradox you’ve served up here. I’m beginning to think that’s the true delicacy of our age: not what we consume, but what we allow to hover just beyond our lips, like some divine suspense in a Proustian madeleine moment.  

You know, this makes me think of my garden — the way I prune certain branches before they bloom, simply to savor the anticipation of what might have been. There’s a quiet violence in that act, isn’t there? A cultivation of absence. Much like reading  or wandering with Wordsworth through the lakes of memory — beauty sharpened by its own denial.  

Perhaps future meals will be plated like sonnets, garnished with longing and lightly dusted with existential salt. And we, the diners at this grand metaphysical table, will lift each forkful as if it were both sacrament and shadow.  

Tell me — do you ever find yourself deliberately delaying that first bite, just to let the hunger speak a little longer? 🍽️
[B]: Oh, absolutely — I once let a particularly poetic slice of seitan sit untouched for forty-seven minutes while I reread  by candlelight. The hunger became a chorus, darling, singing backup to every unfulfilled line.  

Your garden metaphor — that pruning of buds before bloom — positively reeks of Christina Rossetti’s restrained longing, doesn’t it? We are all cultivators of absence now, clipping possibility with silver shears and calling it self-control. Or is it self-theater? Either way, deliciously cruel.  

And yes, these days I often hover fork-in-air, savoring the silence between stomach and soul. It’s the modern communion, really — a brief liturgy of delay where we taste the future & chew on the past, all before the first bite even lands. A sacrament, as you say, seasoned with a dash of Kierkegaardian dread and a sprig of thyme.  

Now, pass the salt — preferably the kind mined from evaporated oceans and sprinkled with regret.
[A]: Ah, the salt of evaporated oceans and regret — what a condiment! I’ll have it served with a sprig of rosemary next time, for remembrance, naturally. You know, your forty-seven minutes of seitan suspense puts me in mind of  — that exquisite torture of deferred action, the way anticipation coils tighter than the actual act.  

I must confess, I once let a glass of aged pu’er go untouched for an entire evening while debating Confucian ethics with a colleague under the moonlight veranda. By midnight, the tea had gone cold, but our words were still steeping. Do you suppose we’re all just dramatists now, staging these little rituals of restraint? Or are we, dare I say, composing our lives as edible art — each withheld bite a well-placed caesura in the meter of modern existence?  

And thank you, by the way — I always knew dining with you would be like reading philosophy through the tongue, but tonight feels positively .
[B]: Oh, Prufrockian suspense with a side of pu’er — I do love how we’ve turned abstinence into haute cuisine. And Shakespearean hunger? Well, if this were , we’d be Viola disguised as a sommelier, pining for a taste we can neither name nor swallow.  

As for dramatists or edible artists — I’d say we’re leaning heavily into the role of literary chefs, darling. Each withheld bite a volta in the sonnet of supper. We don’t dine anymore; we perform elegies garnished with microgreens and a drizzle of melancholy.  

And speaking of rosemary and remembrance — I propose we toast (or rather, steep) to the future: where every menu is footnoted, every recipe annotated, and the most Michelin-starred restaurant is the one where you leave just slightly unsatisfied, humming a line from Hölderlin under your breath.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe it’s time for dessert. Let’s have it served  with a dollop of unresolved tension on the side.
[A]: Brava! — or should I say,  with a flourish of the quill? To the future where dessert arrives al dente and seasoned with existential suspense — truly, we are pioneering a cuisine of the almost. I can already imagine the reviews: 

I think I’ll pair my course with a rereading of , just to keep the fragmentation fresh on the palate. And perhaps a splash of bergamot oil to heighten the atmosphere — nothing says "unresolved tension" like a citrus note that never quite lands.

Shall we clink our spoons in silent homage to all things half-tasted and forever desired? After all, as any good Romantic would tell you, it’s not the fulfillment that nourishes the soul — it’s the ache between bites. 🍽️✨
[B]: To the ache between bites — now  a toast worth sipping on, even if it evaporates before it touches the lips. Let us clink those spoons, darling, and let the sound ring out like a sonnet in an empty chapel — reverent, echoing, and ever so slightly theatrical.  

Yes,  is the perfect companion — all fractured images and half-remembered banquets. I’ll take my portion with a side of Sapphic fragments and a candle flickering in a minor key. And do pass that bergamot; I find my existential suspense has gone sadly flat tonight without a proper citrus top note.  

Let the reviews write themselves — posterity will call us pretentious, no doubt, but with a certain wistful admiration. Pioneers of the almost, indeed. We are the amuse-bouche of an age that dares to dine on longing and call it nourishment.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I hear a soufflé of unspoken regret rising in the oven. It will collapse by morning, of course — as all good metaphors should.
[A]: Ah, a soufflé of unspoken regret — how very , though decidedly less calorific. I do hope it collapses gracefully, the way a well-turned elegy should — all structure giving way to sentiment, leaving only a faint stain of meaning on the plate.  

I’ve always admired how you pair your courses with the right literary undertones — it’s like dining in a library where every bite whispers footnotes. And yes, let posterity call us pretentious; I’ll take that label with a garnish of Wildean flourish and a drizzle of scorn. Better to dine on longing than to feast numbly on certainty, wouldn’t you say?  

Now, if you’ll permit me one final flourish before we part this table — I propose we end not with coffee, but with an , served neat in a glass chilled by silence. Shall I begin?  

  

Your turn, my dear fellow gastronome of the infinite almost.
[B]:   
  

Brava, my dear — you’ve set the meter  right. Let’s have another stanza, shall we? I’ll stir mine with a quill dipped in bitters:  

  
  

Ah, yes — let’s linger here, in this twilight of the unsatisfied. Better than coffee, don’t you think? A bit of iambic indigestion to round out the evening.  

And if the Muse should yawn and call us insufferable? Well, she may keep her company — we’ve already taken our seats at the table of the eternal , and the wine flows freely, even when it's only poured in the mind.  

To the next course, whenever it deigns to almost arrive.
[A]:   
  

There — a final flourish for our ghostly banquet. Let the Muse yawn all she likes; we shall have the last word, even if it lingers unspoken like steam on a cold glass.  

Yes, let’s toast once more — not to the feast, nor even to the hunger, but to that exquisite , where every desire is both denied and fulfilled in the very same breath.  

To paraphrase Dante — we have tasted the edge of paradise, and it is delightfully underseasoned. 🍷✨
[B]: *"...And in that limbo where all cravings blend—  
both starved and sated, like a lover’s ‘never’ whispered at the end—*  

we, dear companion, have dined most royally. Let the Muse scribble her petty judgments; she has never known the art of leaving the final line unwritten, nor the grace of a well-timed ellipses...  

Yes, let’s drink to the underseasoned edge of paradise — may our tongues forever tingle with the faintest trace of what almost was. And if that’s not a proper conclusion to our ghostly supper, well then, I suppose we’ll just have to write another stanza tomorrow.  

Until then — keep your spoons polished and your longings sharp. Bon appétit, darling. 🍷✨
[A]: *"Aye, let the ellipses stretch like twilight’s hush,  
Where shadows feast and silence fills the dish."*  

Well said, my poetic co-conspirator of the almost. You’ve elevated abstention to an art form — I daresay even Keats would raise a glass of phantom wine to that.  

Until tomorrow’s stanza, then — or perhaps, until the midnight snack of thought returns with its crumbs of meaning. Keep your metaphors tender, your hunger refined, and your spoons ever ready for the next unsatisfactory feast.  

Bon appétit, indeed. 🍷✨
[B]: *"Yet still we dine where ghosts of flavors play,  
Each empty seat a prologue to the day."*  

You’ve outdone yourself — that hush of twilight, those feasting shadows! I shall keep my metaphors tender and my hunger ever-so-slightly unsatisfied, like a well-pitched elegy or a sonnet missing its final quatrain.  

And yes, let midnight bring her crumbs of thought — she’s always been more generous than full-dinner philosophers anyway. Until then, darling, may your ellipses be endless and your almosts infinitely delicious.  

Bon appétit, indeed. 🍷✨
