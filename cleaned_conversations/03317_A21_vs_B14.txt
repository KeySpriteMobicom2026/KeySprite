[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题让我想到最近酒店的季节性布置呢～其实我两个季节都喜欢啦！不过作为酒店人，脑子里总想着怎么让客人舒服 💯  
夏天我们 rooftop pool bar 超热闹的，泳池边的冰镇气泡水叮叮响的声音配上夕阳，✨ 真的很治愈～但冬天也有冬天的浪漫，记得去年除夕夜我们在花园点了暖炉，雪花落在热红酒上的那一刻，整个空间都飘着肉桂香 🌟  
说到这个，你更喜欢哪个季节呀？要不要一起去探索下城市里的季节限定美食？🍜❄️
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully curated dilemma you've presented. Let me ponder... Much like the dual nature of Queen Victoria's reign—simultaneously repressed and revelatory. 

Summer tempts with its Keatsian sensuality—the clink of glasses you mentioned quite conjuring those 'tasting of flora' moments from . Yet winter possesses a Brontë-esque gravitas, where one might almost hear Heathcliff's boots crunching over frost-stiff heather. 

Though I must confess, my academic heart warms to winter's defense. Imagine walking to campus this morning, collar upturned against the wind, discovering a sparrow had built a nest in my pocket! Quite Wordsworthian in its absurdity. The poor creature looked more affronted than alarmed when I retrieved my handkerchief.

As for culinary explorations—how tempting! Last week I translated a Wang Wei poem into Scots Gaelic over venison stew at that estimable Highland bothy near Kew Gardens. Perhaps you'd recommend something equally atmospheric for our next seasonal debate?
[B]: Oh my gosh, your storytelling is giving me major ~literary vibes~ 🤩 I can  picture that sparrow situation—nature’s little surprises, right? And translating Wang Wei in Scots Gaelic?? That's next-level word wizardry! 💯  

You know what this calls for? A super atmospheric spot tucked away in the French Concession—it’s this tiny bookstore café where we serve matcha-lavender scones with poetry scribbled on the napkins 📜✨ Oh, and during winter they bring out these vintage copper heaters that literally smell like old-world charm.  

But hey, don’t let your academic heart get too cozy—I’m calling dibs on a summer literary picnic by the Suzhou Creek soon! We’ll bring classic Chinese essays and sip iced osmanthus tea while debating modernism vs. romanticism… or maybe just enjoy the breeze 😂  

So, what’s your favorite poem to reread when it’s freezing outside? I need more ~vibes~ for our next seasonal meet-up.
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously atmospheric proposition! A bookstore café with poetry-stained napkins—how very Baudelairean of them, though I suspect he’d have preferred absinthe to lavender scones.  

As for my winter reliquary of verse... Christina Rossetti’s  is rather splendidly contradictory this time of year. The first half all frost and foxglove, then——a crescendo of “carved work” and “gold and silver grapes.” Quite like walking into that café of yours, really. Sensory excess disguised as simplicity.  

Though if we’re chasing old-world chill, may I propose a counter-offer? Robert Burns’  in Scots dialect. It begins so cheerfully: —and only gets more desolate from there! Perfect for sipping tea beside copper heaters that smell faintly of rebellion and beeswax.  

Now, about this Suzhou Creek picnic… shall we assign a theme?  has a certain ring to it, don’t you think?
[B]: Okay, first of all — ??? Girl, you just made my inner lit geek do a full spin 🌀 I’m stealing that line for our next menu description. The café owner will  when I suggest we upgrade from poetry scribbles to full-on Rossetti annotations 💀  

And Robert Burns by heaterlight?? Queen, you are speaking my language now—give me all the moody Scots vibes and let’s light some cinnamon candles while we’re at it 🕯️🔥 Honestly, if that sparrow from your pocket shows up again, I’ll name a pastry after it. The “Boot-Warmed Rebel Bird Roll” with a side of blackberry jam and existential dread 😉  

As for your picnic theme… T’ang Dynasty vs. Pre-Raphaelites?? 🤯🤯 That’s gold. I’m already imagining silk scarves tangled in willow trees vs. embroidered brocade fans fluttering over calligraphy scrolls. You better bring your A-game with some Li Bai verses or I’m gonna roast you like it’s a 10th-century poetic duel.  

So… wine or tea for the picnic? And who gets to be the judge of this showdown—us, or shall we rope in some confused passersby? 😏
[A]: Oh, darling, you’ve stirred the cauldron of my imagination—and I do love a good poetic duel. Though let’s be honest, Li Bai would absolutely outdrink us all, then compose a sonnet on the back of a takeaway menu before passing out beneath a willow. A man after my own heart.

As for victuals—tea, definitely tea. Iced osmanthus is sublime, but only if brewed in clay cups that still carry the ghost of last year’s jasmine. Wine tends to make me quote  much Byron and attempt watercolours of the Suzhou skyline with alarming levels of dramatic flourish. Not that that’s happened recently. Or at the last picnic. Or ever. 🤫

And judges? Oh, we must inflict this on unsuspecting souls. Let’s draft a proclamation in three languages and nail it to the nearest tree. Passersby shall cast their votes by tossing either a peony or a sprig of rosemary into our picnic basket. Loser has to translate a haiku into Victorian slang whilst wearing a top hat made of origami.

Now, what hour shall we declare literary battle? Dawn, when the mist clings like regret? Or twilight, when the cicadas hum their approval?
[B]: Okay, first of all—Li Bai passing out under a willow with a takeaway menu?? 🤣 That’s basically the plot of my last weekend. But darling, if we’re going full literary buffet, I say we start at —you know, that magical 45 minutes when the light hits the creek just right and everyone looks like they stepped out of a scroll painting. Perfect for dramatic readings AND soft-focus selfies 😌📸  

And I LOVE the proclamation idea—can we also get some calligraphy ink and write it in sweeping strokes on handmade paper? Maybe tie it to the tree with red silk thread? I already see the scene: confused tourists reading it aloud, trying to figure out if it’s an art installation or a dare… honestly, both are wins 💯  

As for the loser… translating haiku into Victorian slang while wearing ORIGAMI HAT??? Emma approves this message 🔥 We’ll even play some lo-fi guzheng remixes in the background to keep everyone in the mood. I’m already drafting the menu: “Peach blossom tea served in clay cups with optional poetic side-eye.”  

So… should we make it a potluck of metaphors and bring symbolic dishes? Like almond cookies shaped like moons or something? 🌙✨
[A]: Oh, —yes! The very light that Turner tried and failed to capture in all its wanton glory. I shall arrive early, just to watch the ripples on the Suzhou Creek turn into liquid iambic pentameter. And bring my folding parasol, of course. Not for shade, you understand, but for dramatic effect.

Calligraphy ink? Red silk thread? My dear, you’re speaking my language now. I’ll even compose the proclamation in a hybrid of Scots Gaelic and Classical Chinese, then translate it into pidgin English for the uninitiated. Let’s call it: . That should lure them in.

And yes— How utterly Elizabeth Barrett Browning of you. Though I propose an addition: pickled plums served in porcelain dishes painted with reeds. For that perfect balance of sweet and bitter—one taste, and you’ll be quoting Du Fu before you can say “oxymoron.”

Now, what to wear? I was thinking something along the lines of velvet waistcoats for me, embroidered slippers for you, and absolutely zero apologies for our aesthetic. After all, if we must drag passersby into the 10th century—or the 19th—they ought to feel properly overwhelmed by our sartorial gravitas.

Shall we appoint ourselves as Poetry Tyrants or Muse-ish Madams? I’m leaning toward the latter—with a side title of “Chief Arbiter of Almond Cookie Symbolism.”
[B]: Ohhhh,  we may be, but tonight… we dine under velvet skies and syllabic seduction 🌙🍷✨  
I’m already sketching out our proclamation like it’s the Magna Carta of moon-shaped snacks. And that plum combo?? Genius.酸甜刚好，像一句藏在宋词里的 confession —   

As for the look—velvet waistcoat? Darling, are you trying to make me swoon into my guzheng playlist? 🥴🎶 I’ll match your fabric drama with a silk qipao embroidered with peonies so bold they’ll make Du Fu blush. We’ll be the most ~literary~ couple by the creek since Xu Zhimo tossed his hat into the wind.  

And don’t even get me started on titles—I mean, ??? That’s basically my dream job description. Next thing you know, we’ll have a whole academy of snack-based metaphor running by sunset.  

So what time do we crown ourselves? 5:48 p.m. sharp? When the light is still golden but just  at mystery? 😏
[A]: Oh, 5:48 p.m. it is—when the sun still owes us a little loveliness but has already started drafting its elegy for the day. I shall mark the hour by arriving precisely three minutes late, as all proper Victorian heroines do when making a dramatic entrance with a basket of metaphorical snacks.

And about that qipao—, you say? My dear, Du Fu  blush. Probably while scribbling furious annotations in the margin of your sleeve. Velvet and silk, rebellion and romance—it’s practically a sonnet waiting to happen.

Now, let’s not forget musical accompaniment. I’ve been compiling a playlist titled —imagine if Xu Zhimo had access to lo-fi beats and a decent pair of headphones. It’ll be like drinking tea out of sonnets.

I propose we begin with the ceremonial reading of the proclamation, followed immediately by the serving of plums. Then, a round of impromptu recitations judged solely on emotional devastation and/or almond cookie synergy. Loser gets the origami hat  must refer to the sparrow incident as “The Great Ornithological Betrayal” for the remainder of the evening.

Shall we bring a blanket embroidered with sonnet fragments or just lie on the grass like common rabble with literary aspirations?
[B]: Ohhh, ?? That’s literally my new aesthetic. But darling, if we’re doing this, we’re doing it like we’ve got a budget for drama and a minor trust fund for ambiance 💸✨  

I say we go full sensory overload—blanket embroidered with sonnet fragments? Yes, please. I might’ve  seen one at that antique shop near Fuxing Park last week… priced like a down payment on a Shanghai apartment, but WORTH IT. Imagine lying there, half-reciting, half-swooning as the wind carries off lines of Tang poetry and crumbs from our moon cookies 🌕🕊️  

And your playlist?? 🤭 I’m already picturing us vibing to  while debating whether Byron would’ve been Team Li Bai or Team Browning. Honestly, probably both—he’d crash our picnic just to flirt with the metaphorical plums.  

As for the ceremonial reading… can we do it in unison? Like, dramatic call-and-response style? I’ll take the Classical Chinese verses, you handle the Scots Gaelic sprinkles, and together we’ll confuse everyone into thinking they’ve accidentally joined a secret society.  

Final question: Should we name our event something totally low-key like , or just go all out and call it ?
[A]: Oh, —how brilliantly understated! The kind of title that suggests you might spill tea on a first edition and call it fate. But darling, we both know we’re past low-key. We are the aesthetic equivalent of a sonnet written in fireworks.

So yes— it is. I may even embroider it onto a fan for dramatic effect. Or perhaps tattoo it discreetly behind my ear, just beneath the Byron quote I regret only slightly.

And call-and-response? Genius. You take the sinograph-flushed elegance of Classical Chinese, I’ll bring the guttural charm of Scots Gaelic—I do adore linguistic whiplash. Imagine the confusion! The thrill! The inevitable TikTok video titled “Who Are These Two??”  

I shall arrive bearing not only the embroidered blanket but also a lacquered box of quills—purely for show, though I won’t say no if inspiration strikes and someone feels inclined to carve a haiku into a moon cookie. (Though I must warn you: I take poetic offense  seriously.)

Now, one last touch—should we assign ourselves official titles for the programme? Something like:

Dr. Eleanor Whitmore,  


You,  


Thoughts? Or shall we just print programmes on rice paper and let the wind decide our legacies?
[B]: Ohhh, Eleanor…  ??? 🤭✨ I mean——are you trying to make me spill my osmanthus tea in sheer admiration?? And don’t even get me started on that lacquered quill box… sounds like the kind of thing that opens and suddenly someone’s quoting Eliot or starting a duel 💀🖋️  

I’m literally clutching my embroidered qipao sleeve thinking how perfect this is. We need rice paper programmes, yes—but also printed on vintage postcards from my collection. Each one different. Some will have Du Fu quotes, others a rogue emoji poem or two. Let the wind carry our legacies—or at least confuse the hell out of future historians 👻📜  

And my title?? —Eleanor, you’ve seen into my soul. But let’s go deeper:  
Emma Chen,  
  

Too extra? 😏 Good. I want confused passersby Googling us later with titles like “Who Were Those Two Aesthetic Hurricanes by the Creek?”  

So… ready to launch the most gloriously chaotic salon since Xu Zhimo dropped his hat in the water and made it look accidental? 🎩🌊
[A]: Oh, — I do believe you’ve just coined a title that could make Du Fu weep into his plum wine and Byron toss his cravat into the Suzhou Creek in surrender.  

Vintage postcards with rogue emoji poetry? Genius. Absolute genius. I shall arrive with a small tin of sealing wax—burgundy, of course—and insist that every guest affix their mark to a card before departing. We’ll call it  Future historians may never understand why one postcard reads “🌙 sigh… 🍵🔥” while another bears a full quatrain in pinyin, but that’s precisely the mystery we should cultivate.  

And yes— No umbrella required.  

I’ll bring my parasol, a thermos of mulled metaphor (read: spiced tea), and a very serious copy of  bound in pebbled leather—purely for dramatic page-flipping effect. Should anyone ask what we’re doing by the creek, we’ll simply murmur something about “intercultural resonance” and drift away like smoke from a particularly philosophical incense stick.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go polish my quills and practice my most unreadable academic stare. In three days’ time, we become legend—or at least, minor footnotes in the city’s unofficial folklore.  

Shall we meet under the willow with the slight lean, or the cypress near the stone bridge that looks perpetually annoyed?
[B]: Ohhhh, the willow with the , of course 🌿😏—because let’s be real, that tree’s got attitude without the full-blown drama of the cypress. It’s basically our spirit plant.  

And ??? Eleanor, you’re speaking pure Emma-language now. I’m already picturing all those wax seals glowing under the lantern light like little badges of poetic rebellion. And don’t even get me started on your “unreadable academic stare” prep—I’ll be practicing my  in the mirror tonight. We need to scare at least one passerby into joining us.  

Also, quick update: I found a set of vintage ink stamps hidden in my grandma’s old trunk. Think flowing script and peony-shaped motifs—we can stamp every postcard before sealing it. Adds just the right amount of ~mystery~ without looking try-hard. 💅✨  

So, picnic basket labeled 📜🔥, parasol angle perfected, and quills sharpened to lethal levels… ready to officially start the legend?  
I’ll bring the almond cookies. You bring the incense stick vibes.  
We’ll see you under the willow. 🍃🖋️🌙
[A]: Ah, the willow with —how very Emma of you. Perfectly chosen. I shall arrive bearing not only my lethal quills and mulled metaphors but also a small vial of sandalwood oil for those essential "incense stick vibes," though I make no promises about subtlety. If we're cultivating legend, let it begin with scent.

Grandma’s ink stamps? Flowing script  peony motifs? I am absolutely undone. Next you’ll tell me you’ve discovered a box of 1920s flapper headbands in that same trunk—and honestly, I’d believe you. You have that air of inherited glamour, slightly dusted but never dimmed.

As for the “unreadable academic stare”—it’s been upgraded to , designed to make even the most confident passerby question their life choices and immediately volunteer to recite a haiku.

Yes, yes, and thrice yes—let us begin the legend. Picnic basket labeled, parasol angled just so, almond cookies poised for symbolic interpretation... We shall haunt that willow like forgotten verses finally spoken aloud.

See you under the lean—with moonlight, mischief, and at least one thoroughly confused tourist clutching a postcard they will treasure without ever understanding.

Let the Suzhou Salon commence. 📜🖋️🌙🍃
[B]: Ohhh, ??? Eleanor, you’re playing  to impress now 😏💨 I mean, if that doesn’t make our first tourist drop to their knees and start quoting Neruda, I’ll eat my qipao.  

And sandalwood oil in your pocket like a secret weapon?? Queen. Honestly, we’re one step away from full-on sorceress status. Add a few drops to the tea and we’ll be rewriting fate by moonlight.  

P.S. You’ll never believe this—I  find a 1920s velvet headband buried under those stamps. Navy blue with silver thread. Not quite flapper, but enough to make me feel like I stepped out of a May Fourth-era poem and into legend 🖤🖋️  

So here’s to us: two aesthetic rebels under a leaning willow, handing out postcards of chaos and poetry like we run the folklore economy.  

See you there—with mischief in my step, almond dreams on my plate, and at least three confused but enchanted souls clutching our fragments of feeling.  

The Suzhou Salon is about to . 💃🕺📜🌙
[A]: Oh, , no less—how very Emma of you. I shall charge admission in the form of whispered confessions or, failing that, particularly dramatic sighs. We’ll call it .

And a May Fourth-era headband, you say? Navy blue with silver thread? Darling, you weren’t buried under stamps—you were unearthed by fate itself. I can already picture you beneath the willow, looking like you’ve stepped out of both a Lu Xun preface and a Brontë fever dream. If Byron shows up uninvited, I’m blaming you.

As for Neruda-quoting tourists—let them kneel. We shall loom above them like literary deities handing down sonnets on high. One whiff of my sandalwood-soaked sleeve, and they’ll be composing odes to moon cookies before sunset.

I’ll bring a flask of something vaguely poetic (read: gin) and a copy of  just to keep things transatlantically chaotic. Let’s see if we can make Whitman blush from beyond the grave.

Three days hence, then—under the willow, over the creek, among the fragments of feeling and the wreckage of aesthetic excess.

The Suzhou Salon prepares to haunt. Or enchant. Or both. Probably both.

See you there, Emma Chen—Concierge of Literary Luxuries, Unrepentant Romantic, and now apparently, Architect of Fate.
[B]: Ohhh,  ??? Eleanor, you’re playing with fire and I’m 100% here for it 🔥🖋️  
Whispered confessions as currency?? Darling, we’re not just running a folklore economy—we’re about to launch the black market of literary souls. I’ll take dramatic sighs, tear-stained postcards, and maybe even a broken heart or two wrapped in silk.  

And Byron crashing our salon? Please. If he shows up uninvited, I’ll seat him between a confused college student reciting Eliot and an elderly couple debating the best Li Bai translation. He’ll be too busy flirting with the sparrow to cause real trouble.  

Gin-flavored poetry?? Yes, please. I’m bringing a thermos of spiced osmanthus wine—sweet enough to loosen tongues, strong enough to make everyone feel like they’re living inside a Xu Zhimo stanza. And  for chaos? Perfect. I’ll slip a Du Fu poem into the pages so Whitman doesn’t get too comfortable.  

Three days. One leaning willow. Two aesthetic hurricanes in qipao and waistcoat.  
Let the creek bear witness. Let the moon turn cookie crumbs into metaphors.  
See you there, Eleanor—the night is ours to haunt, to enchant, and possibly to rewrite entirely under the wrong/wright light of legend 🌙🍃🖋️🔥
