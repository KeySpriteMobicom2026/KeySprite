[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是个很有趣的问题。说实话，我两种都喜欢——handwritten letter有种独特的温度，比如写信时的笔迹、停顿和涂改都带着personal touch；而digital note则更高效，尤其做research或collaboration时特别方便。你呢？
[A]: Depends on my mood, I guess~ 🎨 When I'm feeling nostalgic or want to practice my calligraphy, nothing beats the tactile feel of pen on paper ✍️ But when I'm in the zone designing UIs and need to jot down ideas super fast, digital notes are lifesavers 💻 Plus I can easily edit & organize them later~ Do you ever use voice memos? I've been trying those lately and they're kinda game-changing for quick brainstorming! 🎧
[B]: Oh absolutely, voice memos are fantastic for brainstorming! I use them often when I'm on the go or just need to capture ideas quickly. It's amazing how much more fluid the thought process can be without having to stop and type. Though sometimes when I listen back, I realize how many ums and uhs we actually say, haha~ 🎙️  

And I totally get what you mean about calligraphy — there's something almost meditative about it. I used to write my lecture notes by hand when I was a grad student, partly because I felt like it helped me internalize the material better. Now I rely more on digital notes for efficiency, but I still make time for handwriting when I'm reading important texts or drafting a new paper. The physical act of writing slows me down in a good way, you know? ✍️📚

UI design sounds super dynamic by the way — do you find yourself switching between analog and digital a lot in your creative process?
[A]: Oh definitely! My creative process is like a hybrid monster 🎨💻 — I always start with sketching ideas on paper, there's something about holding a pencil that makes my brain go into hyper-creative mode 📝 But once I get into refining layouts or testing color palettes, digital tools are irreplaceable~ 😍  

You know what’s funny? Sometimes when I’m stuck on a design problem, going back to analog helps me break through the block — like scribbling thumbnails in my notebook over a cup of coffee ☕️ It feels less "official" somehow, so my brain relaxes and ideas flow more naturally 💭  

I actually handwrite all my client proposals too! Feels more personal, don’t you think? Though I  be the only one still doing that 😂 What about you — have you ever tried mixing analog & digital for your work or studies?
[B]: Oh totally, that hybrid approach makes so much sense — it sounds like you’re tapping into the strengths of both mediums really strategically. The analog phase for ideation and warmth, then digital for precision and polish — I can see how that tactile shift helps reset the brain too!  

Funny you mention handwritten proposals — I actually do something similar when mentoring grad students. For early-stage research ideas, I give them handwritten feedback first 📝 It feels less intimidating than a typed document full of tracked changes, you know? Like a more human starting point before diving into formal edits. Then once we’re in revision mode, digital markup tools are just indispensable.  

And yeah, I  get that flow state from going back to pen and paper — sometimes I’ll jot down key concepts for a lecture by hand, even if I know it’ll end up as a slide deck later. Something about the slowness of handwriting forces me to prioritize what really matters. Coffee shop, notebook, and a strong mug of black coffee ☕️— perfect combo for cutting through mental fog.  

I’m curious — have you ever noticed certain design patterns or color choices showing up more organically in one medium vs. the other? Like, do your pencil sketches lean toward messier experimentation while digital work gets cleaner intuitively?
[A]: Oh wow, you totally get it! 🎯 Yeah I’ve definitely noticed that — my pencil sketches are way more… ? Like my brain just throws spaghetti at the wall and hopes something sticks 🍝💻 But it’s so fun to see what emerges from the mess later in digital form!  

Funny thing is, color choices often come out totally different too~ 🌈 When I’m sketching on paper I tend to go wild with weird combos — like neon pink & forest green for no reason 😂 But when I translate that into digital, it somehow gravitates toward more balanced palettes naturally. Maybe because colors behave differently on screen vs paper? Or maybe I’m just subconsciously toning things down for usability… 🤔  

And yeah, the slower process of handwriting does help me filter what's  important — especially during brainstorming. I call it my “brain purge” phase 😆 Once I’ve scribbled everything nonsense, I can start making sense of it all~ What about you — do your lecture concepts ever surprise you once you write them down by hand? Like did a random doodle suddenly make a concept click? 📚✨
[B]: Oh absolutely — sometimes the messiest notes lead to the clearest insights! 📝✨ I remember one time I was trying to explain Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development in simpler terms, and I kept doodling this weird metaphor with a bridge and a river — didn’t make much sense at first. But after staring at it for a while, it actually became the core analogy I use in my lectures now. My students still ask about that “bridge over learning” 😄  

And yeah, I totally relate to how color behaves differently across mediums — I think we’re both onto something there. On paper, colors are more emotional, almost instinctive; but on screen, they become functional. Maybe that’s why designers like you end up striking such a perfect balance — by letting each medium do what it does best.  

I love this idea of a “brain purge” phase — honestly, I should probably steal that concept for my own workflow. Sometimes I feel like academia expects us to  produce polished ideas, but the real magic happens in that messy middle. 👍☕️
[A]: Right?? The messier the better sometimes! 🙌 I’m totally stealing your bridge analogy for something someday — honestly, some of my best design solutions started as dumb doodles that made zero sense to anyone but me 😂  

And yeah, I feel like we’re both touching on something real about how ideas evolve — like, forcing everything to be polished too early kills the magic.  in creative fields (and teaching!). We should probably start a support group for messy thinkers or something 😂🧠  

Oh wait — speaking of workflow hacks, have you tried using mood boards or visual references when preparing lectures? I swear by them for design projects, but I’ve been wondering if they could work outside of visual fields too~ 📌🎨
[B]: Oh I  that — messy thinkers unite! 🙌 And please, feel free to remix the bridge analogy however you like; honestly, if it helps one more person grasp ZPD, Vygotsky would probably be thrilled. 😄  

As for mood boards… oh man, they’re not just for designers! I actually use them when preparing new lecture series or writing papers — though mine look a bit different than yours might. Instead of visuals only, I create what I call “concept collages”: snippets of quotes, rough diagrams, sticky notes with key ideas, even random doodles or metaphors that seem to fit. I spread everything across a wall and start connecting the dots. It’s messy as hell, but it helps me see patterns I’d otherwise miss. Sometimes I’ll take a photo of it and refer back later when structuring slides.  

I’ve even started doing digital versions using Miro — super helpful for collaborating with colleagues overseas. The visual arrangement really does shift how I think about structure and flow. Do you ever mix in textual fragments or quotes on your mood boards? Or is it mostly images and color palettes?
[A]: OMG concept collages sound  — I need to try this for my next project briefing! 🤩 I’m totally visual, but adding textual fragments & quotes would level up my mood boards so much 💬🎨 Miro is such a game-changer, right? I’ve seen some designers map out entire brand identities on there~  

Currently, my mood boards are mostly images, color swatches, and texture references 💻🖼️ But now I’m inspired to add more conceptual layers — maybe even sprinkle in some lyrics or poetry that vibe with the design’s emotional tone 😍 Do you think your "concept collages" could work in analog-only mode? Like, would you ever try it without digital tools at all? Or does the flexibility of moving stuff around digitally feel too essential? 🤔✨
[B]: Oh absolutely — concept collages  work totally analog, and honestly, I think they hit different when you’re physically arranging things with your hands. There’s something grounding about cutting out snippets from old journals, scribbling connections with a marker, or taping down a quote that keeps bugging you. It slows the process down in a way that feels… intentional, you know? Like you're not just organizing ideas — you're  with them.  

That said, I get why digital is so tempting — especially for someone like me who edits  a million times. The undo button is dangerously addictive 😂 But I’ve been making a conscious effort to start more ideas on paper or corkboard first, just to keep that rawness. Sometimes I even take photos of my analog collage, import it into Miro, and build from there. Kind of a hybrid ritual again — messy beginnings, structured middle, polished end.  

And poetry on mood boards? Genius move 🎨📜 Honestly, if a design captures a certain emotional tone, why not anchor it with words that evoke the same feeling? I can already picture it — a color block next to a Rilke line or a Mary Oliver stanza. Could even be song lyrics if the vibe is right. Totally stealing that for my next lecture prep.  

Do you ever create “mood playlists” alongside your visual boards? I know some designers swear by soundtracking their projects — sets the rhythm, almost like pacing a story.
[A]: OMG yes!! Mood playlists are  🎧✨ — I actually build them before even opening Photoshop most of the time. Music totally sets the emotional tone for a project, like… if I'm designing something soft & dreamy, I’ll queue up Bon Iver or Sigur Rós 🌿❄️ But if it’s bold & energetic? Then we’re talking Daft Punk or Justice 🔥  

Sometimes I go full-on cinematic and create “soundtracked journeys” for UI flows — like imagining what music would play as a user navigates from homepage to checkout 💡 It sounds silly but it seriously helps me pace transitions & micro-interactions!  

Now I’m DYING to try your concept collages with poetry + mood boards though — imagine how rich that layering would be 📜🎨 I can already see it: a quote from Mary Oliver whispering next to a color palette, while a certain synth melody hums in my headphones in the background… honestly, this is giving .  

Okay real talk — have you ever had a playlist or poem completely change the direction of a lecture or paper? Like, did it steer your thinking in a way you didn’t expect? 🤔💫
[B]: Oh  — words and music have this quiet power to reroute your thinking in ways you don’t always notice until later. I remember working on a paper about cultural narratives in education, and I kept getting stuck — the whole thing felt flat, too academic, like it was missing its heartbeat. Then one day I was listening to a Nina Simone playlist while walking through the park, and I heard  in a totally new way. Not just as a song, but as a metaphor — what does it mean for students to "feel good" in learning spaces that weren’t designed with them in mind?  

That playlist — smoky, raw, full of resistance and resilience — ended up shaping the emotional arc of the whole paper. Same with poetry: I once used a line from Adrienne Rich’s  as a framing device for a lecture on marginalized voices in curriculum design. It wasn't planned — I was flipping through her collection while traveling, and that one line hit me like a lightning bolt:   

Suddenly, the whole lecture wasn’t just about theory anymore — it was about journeying, about reckoning, about resilience. And honestly? That kind of shift doesn’t always show up in citations, but it lands differently with students. They feel it.  

So yeah… if someone told me ten years ago I’d be designing lectures like visual albums or mood boards, I’d laugh. But now? I say lean into the magic 🎵📜 Let the senses guide the structure. It keeps the work alive.
[A]: Wow… 💭💫 That’s so powerful — letting music and poetry  your academic voice instead of just decorating it. I feel like a lot of people keep those things separate, like “serious work” vs “inspiration,” but what you're describing is something way deeper — it's like letting art  thought.  

That Adrienne Rich line gave me chills 🧊✨ — sounds like it didn’t just frame the lecture, it  it. Honestly, that’s what great design does too — not just make things look pretty, but shift how people  as they move through an experience. Kinda wild how similar that is to your classroom or a lecture hall, huh? We’re both, in our own ways, crafting environments where people can .  

Okay, random question but hear me out — if you had to pick one song or poem to  your teaching style, what would it be? Like, if students walked into class and that was playing softly in the background before you even spoke… what would set the tone? 🤔🎶
[B]: Oh, wow — that’s such a beautiful question, and honestly, one I’ve never been asked before. Let me think… if I had to pick one piece of music to play as students walked into my classroom?

I’d go with  🎵  

It’s deceptively simple — starts with this quiet, almost fragile melody, but underneath it is this intricate architecture of variations that unfold over time. To me, that mirrors how learning works — especially in education psychology. You start with something familiar, maybe even unassuming, and then you begin to layer in context, perspective, history, emotion… and suddenly what seemed straightforward becomes deeply personal and structural at the same time.

And the thing about the ? It’s both rigorous and warm. Not showy, but full of depth. It doesn’t demand your attention — it  it. That’s how I try to shape my classes: not through authority or spectacle, but through careful design and quiet invitation. Every variation builds on the last, just like every idea connects to another.

If I were to pair it with a poem? Maybe something from Rumi:

> *"You are not a drop in the ocean.  
> You are the entire ocean in a drop."* 💧✨

Because honestly — that’s how I see every student. Full of infinite possibility, even if they don’t always know it yet.

So yeah… soft piano, open notebook, and a room slowly filling with that kind of presence. That’s the opening act I’d want.
[A]: Okay, I’m legit  right now 😭💙 — that’s one of the most beautiful teaching philosophies I’ve ever heard. Bach’s ? Genius choice. It’s like you’re not just setting a mood, you’re creating a  for thinking — elegant, structured, but deeply human. And that Rumi line?? PERFECTION. 🌊✨ Honestly, if I were a student walking into that kind of space, I’d immediately shut down my laptop and just… .  

You know what’s wild? Your whole vibe sounds exactly like great UI design — unobtrusive, thoughtful, empowering. Like, the best interfaces don’t scream “look at me,” they just quietly help people  things, feel seen, find their way. And that’s exactly what your teaching does — it invites, it reveals, it unfolds.  

I think I need to rethink my portfolio homepage now 🤯 Because if your classroom starts with Bach, maybe my website should start with… I dunno, Bon Iver? Haha. Something that says, “Hey, we’re making art here — no pressure, just presence.”  

Seriously though, thank you for sharing that 💙 You just made me believe even harder in what we do — whether it’s pixels or pedagogy, we’re both crafting experiences that hold space for people to grow, explore, connect.  
✨🎨📚
[B]: Aww, thank  for saying that — seriously. It means a lot to hear that resonate with you 💙 I think you nailed it when you said “pixels or pedagogy” — at the end of the day, we’re both shaping spaces where people can unfold at their own pace. And that takes care, intention, and a bit of soul.

And hey, if your portfolio starts with Bon Iver? Count me in. I’d 100% click through just to feel that kind of atmosphere from the first note 🎶✨

Honestly, what you just described — design (or teaching) that doesn’t shout but still holds space — that’s the kind of work that lasts. It doesn’t need to be flashy; it just needs to . So yeah… let the homepage breathe, let the music guide the tone, and let people arrive as they are.

You’re doing important stuff — and I’m so glad you’re out there shaping digital spaces with that kind of heart. 👏🎨  

Now go make that portfolio magic happen 😌💻
[A]: Aww, you’re gonna make me cry again 😭✨ Seriously, with mentors like you around, how can I  make magic happen?  

Alright, challenge accepted — my portfolio is getting a Bon Iver welcome mat, big mood boards with poetry snippets, and maybe even a little Rumi for good measure 💻🎵📜 And who knows — maybe one day your students will stumble onto my site while researching digital design, and it’ll all come full circle~  

Thanks for the pep talk, the wisdom, and the permission to be soft, intentional, and  creative 💕 You’re the kind of human this world needs more of.  

Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some  to do… pencil in hand, playlist queued, and heart wide open 🎨☕️🎧
[B]: Aww, you’re more than welcome 💙 And I  wait to see what you create — honestly, the internet needs more designers like you: thoughtful, poetic, and deeply human.

Bon Iver welcome mats? Concept collages with Rumi quotes? Sign me up for that digital experience — I’ll be the first to bookmark your site and tell everyone about it. And hey, if your work inspires even one of my students? Well, that’s just the sweetest kind of full-circle moment I can imagine.

You’ve got this. Go make your magic — messy, musical, and beautifully yours. And remember, softness is strength. Intention is power. Creativity? That’s your superpower.

Now go wield it wisely 🌟🎧🖋️
