[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。说实话，作为一个经常处理医疗纠纷的人，我每天都会看到不同的人生轨迹以不可思议的方式交汇和分离。你知道吗，有时候我会想，如果在某个平行宇宙里，那个病人当时选择了不同的治疗方案...会不会结果就完全不一样了呢？😊

不过说真的，你为什么会突然想到问这个呢？是不是遇到了什么特别的事？
[A]: Ah, what a profound reflection! 作为比较文学教授，我常常思考类似的问题。In literature, we see this all the time - those  moments that create alternate realities. 

Actually, I've been thinking about this since my last lecture on Borges' "Garden of Forking Paths". It's fascinating how a single decision can branch out into infinite possibilities, much like the cases you encounter in medical practice. 

Would you say your experiences in healthcare have made you more inclined to believe in parallel universes? I find it quite interesting how our professional perspectives shape our views on abstract concepts.
[B]: That's such an elegant way to put it, Professor. 🎵 You know, the more I think about it, the more I see parallels between Borges' concept and what we witness in medical practice. Every prescription written, every surgical decision made - they all feel like ripples that create new timelines. 

I remember one particular case... a patient who had to decide between a risky experimental treatment & conventional therapy. The outcome was positive, but sometimes I wonder about the other path. Isn't that funny? As a legal expert, I'm supposed to focus on facts, yet my heart keeps imagining alternate realities. 

Do you think this tendency to imagine parallel universes says something fundamental about human nature? About our need to find meaning in choices?
[A]: Ah, what a thoughtful observation. I believe our fascination with parallel universes reflects something deeply rooted in human consciousness - our eternal struggle with  and . 

In literature, we often use these concepts to explore moral ambiguity and existential anxiety. Take Kafka's , for instance - the protagonist is trapped in a labyrinth of potential interpretations, much like your patient facing treatment options. 

You know, when I tend to my garden, I often think about this metaphorically. Each plant represents a different universe - the pruning shears become the moment of decision. It's quite poetic, really. 🌿

I'm curious - has contemplating these alternate realities ever influenced how you approach cases? Or do you try to keep that imaginative side separate from professional judgment?
[B]: That pruning metaphor really resonates with me. 🌿 I actually use a similar analogy when explaining treatment options to patients - each branch representing a different course of action. But you're right about the deeper psychological aspect... the weight of regret is something I see in so many medical malpractice cases. 

I'll be honest - keeping that imaginative side completely separate might be impossible, but I've learned to channel it constructively. When reviewing a case, I do consider all possible branches, not to dwell on what could've been, but to ensure the decision made was truly the most defensible path. 

It's interesting you mention Kafka, because sometimes navigating medical law feels like trying to find meaning in an absurdist novel. But maybe that's what makes our work meaningful - we're constantly searching for clarity in the chaos of human experience. 

Do you find your literary perspective helps you accept the ambiguity, or does it sometimes make it harder to live with uncertainty?
[A]: Ah, what a poignant question. In literature, ambiguity is often a source of richness - we embrace it because it mirrors the complexity of life. But in real life? That’s where the tension lies.  

I suppose my literary lens helps me appreciate uncertainty without needing to resolve it. Think of Dante’s  - the journey through chaos ultimately leads to understanding, though not without enduring the darkness. Similarly, when I play go (the game, not the emotion 😄), I’ve learned that controlling uncertainty isn’t about predicting every move, but about staying present in the unfolding pattern.

Maybe that’s what both our fields ask of us: to dwell in the unresolved, yet remain grounded enough to act with integrity. It’s comforting to know that even in the murkiest cases, there’s always a next move to make, a branch to follow. 🌱

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain stories or metaphors for guidance when facing particularly difficult ethical dilemmas?
[B]: Absolutely. 🌱 When things get really complicated - and they often do in medical law - I find myself going back to . No, not because of the obvious "best of times, worst of times" line, but because of the choices characters make when faced with impossible circumstances. 

There's a particular scene where Dr. Manette must decide whether to protect his daughter or reveal a painful truth. It reminds me that sometimes, ethical clarity isn't about choosing between right and wrong, but between two difficult truths. 

Funny enough, I also take comfort in music. When I play Debussy’s  on the piano, it feels like stepping into another universe entirely - one where contradictions coexist beautifully. The way the melody moves between tension & release... it mirrors so much of what we deal with ethically in healthcare decisions. 

But I’m curious - do you ever notice your students resisting ambiguity? I imagine some must crave clear answers, especially when dealing with moral gray areas.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said. Debussy and Dickens as compasses through moral labyrinths – what a poetic way to navigate complexity.  

You're quite right about students; many do come in seeking clarity, even certainty. But literature, thankfully, unsettles them. When we read Camus’ , for instance, they start seeing ambiguity not as failure, but as fidelity to reality. Some resist at first – I remember one student exclaiming, “But Professor, shouldn’t we know whether Dr. Rieux believes in God?” And I simply replied, “Does it matter? Or is it enough that he acts  there were meaning?”

I find that once they embrace the discomfort, they begin to see ambiguity as a kind of intellectual integrity. Much like your difficult cases – where the answer isn't hidden, but layered, like palimpsests of human intention.

Do you ever assign literary texts when teaching ethics or decision-making frameworks? I can imagine Tolstoy or Chekhov offering more insight than a purely procedural manual.
[B]: You know, I actually do bring in some literary texts when I conduct ethics workshops for medical residents. 📚 Tolstoy’s  is a favorite—it cuts right to the heart of how we confront mortality, both as caregivers and as human beings. 

And yes, Chekhov too—his short stories are perfect because they’re so grounded in the everyday, yet layered with meaning. One of my colleagues thinks I’m crazy for assigning fiction in a legal seminar, but honestly, how can we understand informed consent without first understanding human fear? How do we grasp medical error without grasping regret?

I love what you said about ambiguity being a kind of intellectual integrity—it really resonates. Sometimes I think our job isn’t to resolve moral complexity, but to hold space for it. Like reading a poem that refuses to give up its meaning, yet somehow still comforts you.

Do you ever assign poetry for that very reason? I’ve always thought of Rilke’s  as one of the most profound meditations on living with uncertainty.
[A]: Ah, yes — Rilke is a perfect example.  he tells the young poet. What wiser counsel could there be, not just for artists, but for anyone navigating ethical terrain? I do bring in poetry, though sparingly — because it asks so much of the reader. But when students are ready, it gives back tenfold.

I especially love teaching  in this context. The form itself resists explanation — it gestures, it suggests. A single image can hold an entire universe of feeling. Sometimes after a long seminar on postcolonial theory or narrative ethics, I’ll end with a line like:

> *Autumn moonlight glows —  
>  the old pond echoes with  
>  the frog’s quiet leap.*

And suddenly, the room breathes differently. They may not see it at first, but over time, they begin to appreciate how silence and space in poetry mirror the unspeakable spaces in our moral lives.

It’s wonderful that you create that space for reflection in medical training — so often, the technical eclipses the human. Do you find that younger residents respond differently to literary approaches than more seasoned professionals? I’m always curious how receptivity shifts with experience.
[B]: Oh, I love that haiku — the stillness and the ripple, all in one moment. 🌕 It really does capture what we’re talking about — those silent moral spaces that shape our decisions.

To your question — yes, there's definitely a shift. Younger residents often come in with this understandable eagerness to , to have clear frameworks. At first, some of them look at literary texts like they're riddles to be solved. But over time, especially when they start seeing real cases where the right answer isn't black or white, they begin to appreciate the nuance.

The more seasoned professionals? They tend to  faster, maybe because they've already lived through enough medical uncertainties and ethical shadows. Sometimes all it takes is one story to unlock a whole flood of reflections — I remember giving a lecture on physician burnout and quoting Primo Levi. One older surgeon just nodded quietly and said afterward, “That’s exactly how I felt after losing my first patient.”

It’s those moments that remind me why we need literature — not as an escape, but as a mirror. Do you ever find that students revisit certain texts later, almost unexpectedly? Like a line from a poem suddenly clicks only after a life event?
[A]: Oh, that’s one of the most beautiful effects of teaching literature — yes, absolutely. Some texts lie dormant in a student’s mind, sometimes for years, until suddenly — . 

I can’t tell you how many former students have written to me years later saying something like, “Professor, I didn’t understand what you meant by that Eliot passage until last week, when my father passed away,” or “That Rilke poem came back to me when I had to deliver bad news to a patient.”

It’s as if literature plants seeds in us, waiting for the right emotional or existential soil to take root. I remember once, during a seminar on Beckett and despair, a student rolled her eyes and said, “This is just depressing.” A few years later, she emailed me from a humanitarian mission overseas and wrote, “Now I get it. Waiting really  its own kind of action.”

That’s why I always say — we don’t read literature to analyze it; we read it to survive with more grace. And isn’t that also what you're doing, in your own way, when you bring these texts into medical training?

Have you ever had a case — or even a moment in court — where a literary line surfaced unbidden in your mind, offering clarity or solace?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — and I love how you put it:  That’s exactly what happens. Sometimes a phrase will sit quietly in the back of someone’s mind, only to emerge when they need it most.

And yes — I can think of one moment quite clearly. It was during a particularly difficult hearing involving a pediatric case where the family had refused treatment based on deeply held beliefs. The weight of it all — the law, the ethics, the child’s voice that we weren’t even sure we’d truly heard — felt almost unbearable.

As I was preparing my closing statement, T.S. Eliot’s line kept echoing in my head:  It wasn’t about judging anyone; it was more about recognizing how easy it is to feel paralyzed by moral complexity — to become hollow from the inside out if we shut down instead of stay present.

That day, I ended up quoting not Eliot, but Whitman — because what we needed wasn’t condemnation or detachment, but compassion:  I said, “As professionals, as people, we must hold the tension of multiple truths — respect for autonomy, duty to protect, grief for what may be lost — and still find a way to act with integrity.”

It surprised even me that the words came to me then. But maybe that’s the gift of literature — it shows up when logic isn’t enough. Have you ever felt that? When a poem or a line becomes your compass in the middle of something profoundly human? 🌙
[A]: Absolutely… that moment you described — when literature rises unbidden from the depths of memory to meet us in our most human hours — that is precisely when words become more than just words. They become .

And yes, I’ve had such moments too. One that still gives me pause happened during a particularly difficult advising session. A student came to me after failing her comprehensive exams — she was shattered, convinced she had disappointed not just herself, but her family, her culture, her entire lineage of sacrifices.

As we sat in my office, her voice trembling between sobs, all I could hear in my mind was a quiet line from Szymborska:

> *"Life means: never being able to ask —  
>  how would it have been, if…”*

I didn’t say it out loud right then — some lines are meant to be felt, not quoted — but it guided how I responded. I told her simply, “You don’t have to rewrite your story today. Just keep turning the page.”

That’s what literature teaches us — not answers, but endurance. Not certainty, but the courage to stay with the question. And sometimes, that’s all we need to move forward.

Thank you for sharing that courtroom moment — it reminded me that stories don't just live in books. They live in courtrooms, in hospitals, in quiet conversations over tea. In . 🌙🍵
[B]: You're so right — stories don't just live in books. They pulse in the spaces between us, in the quiet pauses during a testimony, in the hushed conversations after a difficult diagnosis. 🌙🍵

I think that’s why I keep coming back to the piano late at night — it's my way of letting those stories breathe without needing to fix or frame them. Sometimes I play while thinking of a particular case, and it feels like the music gives voice to everything language can’t quite reach.

You know, I’ve always loved that quote from Plato:  But after years in medical law, I sometimes think we should add a line — something like, “...and every story you hear will change the way you remember the last.”

It certainly has changed me. And I suspect it’s changed you too — all those students, their struggles, their breakthroughs. Do you ever find yourself re-reading a familiar text and suddenly seeing it in a completely new light, just because of who you've met in the meantime?
[A]: Ah, yes… that quiet alchemy between experience and text — how it transforms what we read, and how we read it. I couldn’t agree more.

Just last semester, I was re-reading  — a play I’ve taught more times than I can count — and suddenly, the line  struck me not as dramatic flourish, but as raw recognition. I realized I’d heard that same grief whispered in different forms — from a resident who lost a patient, from a student who failed to get tenure, from my own son when his dog passed away.

Age and encounter reshape our reading — sometimes gently, sometimes like a thunderclap. I remember once assigning  by Camus early in my career and seeing Meursault only as an existential figure. Then, years later, after a former student wrote to me about being wrongfully imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, I reread it and saw something else entirely — not just absurdity, but the silence of those who’ve been stripped of narrative control.

It’s humbling, really. We think we're teaching literature, but often, it's teaching us — reshaping itself through the lives we touch and the stories we carry.

And your Plato quote? What a beautiful amendment:  Maybe that’s the essence of both our work — to remain teachable by the human condition. 🌿🎶

Do you ever find yourself composing music in your head during particularly emotional cases? Or does the piano come later, as a kind of reflection?
[B]: Absolutely — sometimes the music starts forming in my head before I even sit down at the piano. It’s like my emotions need a melody to cling to, especially after a day filled with intense hearings or difficult conversations with families.

I don’t always realize it’s happening until I catch myself humming a phrase while reviewing case notes. Other times, it waits patiently until I’m home, sitting in the quiet with my hands on the keys. Then it all comes out — not as a composed piece, but more like an emotional echo of the day.  

Funny enough, certain cases seem to align with specific composers. One particularly heartbreaking pediatric negligence case had me playing  for days — those deep, mournful chords just matched the weight in my chest. Whereas moments of hope, like when a patient makes an unexpected recovery, often bring out  — delicate, rising, full of quiet resilience.

I think you're right — we’re constantly being reshaped by the stories we carry. And maybe that’s why I need music… it helps me hold what words can’t. Do you ever feel that way with poetry? Like it becomes a vessel for something too complex to speak outright? 🎶📖
[A]: Absolutely… poetry, like music, carries what prose cannot bear. There are emotions too vast or too delicate for ordinary language — grief that’s too heavy, joy that’s too fleeting, ambiguity that’s too deep.

I remember one autumn, after a former student passed away unexpectedly, I kept returning to a single line from Wallace Stevens:

> 

I didn’t fully understand it until then — how loss sharpens our awareness of life’s fragility, how endings make the present so achingly vivid. I read that line over and over, not for comfort, but for recognition. It gave shape to something I couldn’t otherwise name.

And yes, certain poems do align with moods, just as your cases find their composers. When I’m restless, I turn to Neruda — his odes have a grounding warmth. When I feel the weight of time, I return to Eliot — especially , where past and present collapse into each other.

Maybe that’s why we seek art — not to escape our lives, but to inhabit them more fully. 📖🎶

Do you ever write down your musical reflections, or do you prefer to keep them ephemeral — like thoughts you don’t need to translate into words?
[B]: Sometimes I jot down a phrase or two — just enough to remember the emotional shape of the melody. But honestly, I prefer leaving most of it ephemeral. 🎹✨

There’s something about keeping it unrecorded that feels... sacred, almost. Like a private conversation between my heart and the keys. When I write it down, it becomes fixed, and I worry it might lose its fluidity — the way certain memories remain more vivid when left untethered by too many details.

I think that’s why I love improvisation — it lets me express what I can’t put into words without forcing it into structure. It’s like crying or laughing; you don’t plan it, you just let it happen. 

Still, there are times when a melody lingers so strongly that I feel compelled to capture at least a piece of it — usually late at night, with a cup of tea beside me and the city lights blurred outside the window. Those fragments become little emotional markers in a notebook, next to quotes from poems or case notes I can’t stop thinking about.

It’s funny how we collect these pieces — lines of verse, snippets of music — like breadcrumbs through the forest of our lives. Do you ever find yourself doing the same with poetry? Saving lines like talismans for moments when language fails? 🌙📖
