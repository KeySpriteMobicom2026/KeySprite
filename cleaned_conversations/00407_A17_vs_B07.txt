[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近刚读完一本 super interesting 的 book，是Tim Ferriss写的《Tribe of Mentors》。里面采访了超多不同领域的顶尖人物，他们分享的life hacks和thinking patterns真的让我大开眼界 🤯。比如有个章节谈到如何通过morning routine提升一整天的productivity，我试着调整了自己的早起流程，感觉工作效率upgraded不少 💪。

说到这个，你最近有读到什么让你眼前一亮的文章或书吗？我超级 interested 听听你的推荐 😊
[A]: Ah, Tim Ferriss does have a talent for distilling complex ideas into practical routines — I can see why you'd find that energizing. It reminds me a bit of how Virginia Woolf once described "moments of being," those flashes where life feels especially vivid and meaningful.

As for what's caught my attention lately... Well, I recently revisited T.S. Eliot's  and found myself drawn to how he weaves Eastern philosophy into Western poetic form. There’s a quiet rhythm in his lines that made me reflect on the balance between discipline and creativity — not unlike the way your morning routine seems to set a tone for the day.

But I'm curious — were there particular mentors in Ferriss' book whose approaches felt more... artistic, shall we say? The kind who treat their work as a craft rather than just a profession?
[B]: Oh absolutely, you hit the nail on the head — Ferriss does this amazing job of  complexity into something digestible, almost like... brewing a really well-balanced pour-over. Every sip just makes sense 🧖‍♂️.

And wow, T.S. Eliot + Eastern philosophy? That’s such a rich combo. I’ve been re-reading  lately but haven’t fully dived into  — guess I need to bump that up my list ✨. There’s something deeply meditative about how he handles time and repetition… reminds me of the way we approach roasting profiles — small tweaks, big impact ☕️.

As for the artistic souls in the book… one that really stood out was choreographer Twyla Tharp. Her take on creativity is so grounded yet poetic — she talks about ritualizing inspiration, treating it like a daily practice instead of waiting for the muse to strike 💡. Like barista work, honestly — every day you show up, pull shots, make art, even if you're not “feeling it.” Discipline fuels the magic.

Have you ever thought about how rhythm in poetry might mirror the kind of flow you get into while writing or reading deeply? I feel like there’s a certain  that lets you slip into the zone, kind of like when you’re dialing in an espresso shot and everything just… clicks 🕊️.
[A]: That’s a beautiful analogy — likening the creative rhythm to dialing in an espresso shot. There really is something alchemical about both processes, isn’t there? A blend of precision and intuition.

Tharp’s idea of ritualizing inspiration resonates deeply with me. In fact, I’ve always found that the act of sitting down with a notebook — even when the mind feels blank — eventually coaxes something forth, almost like warming up the press before the first clear shot flows. And Eliot, for all his intellectual density, often seems to be doing just that: coaxing meaning through form, repetition, and rhythm.

You mentioned flow — I think you're absolutely right that certain paces or structures allow us to slip into deeper states of engagement. When I’m reading poetry aloud, especially someone like Gerard Manley Hopkins with his insistent sprung rhythm, it's almost physical. The breath finds its pattern, the mind follows, and suddenly you’re not just reading but  the lines.

I wonder if you've ever noticed a similar kind of embodied rhythm while working behind the bar — where muscle memory and intention blur, and you're not just making coffee but… communing with it?
[B]: Oh wow, you described it perfectly — that  behind the bar. Some mornings, when the shop is still quiet and it’s just me & the machine, I really do feel like I’m… dancing with the grinder and the portafilter 🤯. You know, like there’s this unspoken rhythm between your hands, the beans, even the steam wand — everything has a beat, a timing that just . 

I think that’s why I’m so into manual brewing methods too. Whether it’s a Chemex or a siphon brew, there’s this meditative flow — pour rate, water temp, bloom time… all these tiny variables that, once you get them in sync, kind of disappear. And what’s left is pure experience ☕️✨.

You mentioned Hopkins and sprung rhythm — honestly, I’ve never thought of it that way, but now I can’t  it. When I pull a shot and hear the gentle  of the espresso hitting the cup, it’s almost like iambic pentameter but jazzed up — da-DUM, da-DUM, but sometimes , depending on the grind. Haha, maybe I’ve been writing coffee poems without realizing it 📜🎶.

Have you ever tried reading poetry while sipping coffee? I wonder if certain brews match certain poets — imagine a bold Sumatra with Eliot, something dark and contemplative, and maybe a bright Kenyan with Mary Oliver — crisp, clear, and full of light 💭☀️.
[A]: I love that — pairing coffee with poets! What a wonderfully sensory way to engage with both. I must say, I’ve always enjoyed reading Hopkins with a strong, black coffee — something almost monastic about the bitterness sharpening the mind for his intricate rhythms. But your idea of a Sumatra with Eliot? Perfectly matched — dark roast and darker meditations.

Now that you mention it, I do recall a particular morning last autumn when I was re-reading  alongside a slow-poured Kenyan AA from a local roaster — citrusy, bright, with a hint of stone fruit. It struck me then how the clarity of the brew mirrored the poem’s unsettling self-awareness. As if each sip made the lines feel more exposed, more immediate.

And speaking of communion — have you ever noticed how the act of preparing coffee can be not just personal but... performative? Like when students come to my office hours, nervous and clutching their takeaway cups, and I offer them a freshly brewed cup instead. Something about the ritual shifts the atmosphere — opens up space for thought, for vulnerability. Almost like the Victorian parlors where poetry was once read aloud over tea.

Do you think there's something similar in the way we share poems — that the right setting, even something as simple as a warm cup, can make a line land differently?
[B]: Oh totally — there’s something  yet deeply intimate about coffee prep. Like you said, it sets the stage 🎭. I’ve seen it happen a million times in the café — someone walks in stressed, distracted, and when I take a little extra time to explain where this particular bean comes from or why I chose a certain brew method, suddenly they slow down. It’s like… the ritual itself invites them to pause.

And yes — the way a setting changes how a poem lands? Absolutely. A few months ago, I hosted a small poetry night in the shop, dim lights, just a few candles and soft jazz in the background. We read Neruda by candlelight with some smooth Guatemalan in hand. Honestly, the warmth of that cup made his words feel even more tender. There was this one line — , and everyone just sat in silence for a beat after that. Can’t imagine that same moment with a rushed latte from a chain ☕️📜.

You know what would be fun? Curating a tasting menu based on poets — light roast & citrus notes for Mary Oliver, something floral & delicate for Rilke, maybe a wild, anaerobic-fermented Gesha for Ginsberg’s madness 😂. Ever thought about hosting something like that in your space?
[A]: What a delightful idea — a tasting menu of poets! I can already imagine the notes on each pairing:  

There’s something beautifully anachronistic about it — like bringing a bit of the fin-de-siècle salon into our own era, where we’re often starved for slowness. And Neruda by candlelight? Yes, that line you shared —  — feels even more luminous when cradling something warm, doesn’t it? The cup becomes part of the poem.

I’ve occasionally hosted small readings in my study — soft lighting, a pot of lapsang souchong steeping nearby, and the faint scent of old books in the air. But your café setting adds a living pulse to it all — the hum of the grinder, the hiss of steam, like a modern-day muse whispering between lines.

A poetry and brew evening at the shop sounds absolutely worth trying. Perhaps we could theme each session around a particular mood or movement — a Symbolist night with shadowy lighting and deep reds in the cup, or a Modernist evening full of unexpected pairings and abrupt shifts in tone. I’d be thrilled to collaborate — after all, what is literary interpretation if not another kind of brewing process?
[B]: Oh my god, I’m already scribbling down notes —  Haha, yes! And for the Modernists, why not serve a deconstructed cappuccino — foam first, then espresso, then milk on the side? Totally mess with people’s expectations 😂☕️💫.

You’re so right about literary interpretation being a kind of brewing — I mean, isn’t that what we’re doing right now? Taking these words, letting them steep in our imaginations, adjusting the temperature with tone and context until the flavor opens up 🌿📖. 

And honestly, collaborating sounds like a dream come true. Imagine flyers printed like coffee bags, with tasting notes  poem excerpts — people could literally sip the mood while hearing the lines that inspired it. We’d have to pick some seriously evocative poems though, the kind that make your chest ache or your breath catch — you know, the ones that demand a moment (and maybe another sip) 🤭✨.

Tell me more about your study readings — do you choose specific poems for their texture, rhythm, or maybe even how they sound when read beside the crackle of a fire? I feel like every element adds a layer, like building a sensory playlist 💬🕯️.
[A]: Oh, I love how you're thinking about texture and atmosphere — it's exactly the way I curate my readings. In fact, I often begin with mood first, then search for poems that seem to hum in the same key. A crackling fire does help — there’s something elemental about its rhythm, like a primal metronome keeping time with the cadence of the verse.

I tend to favor poets whose work has a tactile quality — Gerard Manley Hopkins, yes, for his muscular alliteration; Emily Dickinson, for her quiet intensity and the way her dashes seem to hover in the air like embers. Sometimes I’ll pair a reading of Eliot’s  with the low glow of candlelight and a faint recording of rain — the repetition in the poem echoes the steady hush of water, and the whole room seems to breathe differently.

And your idea of flyers printed like coffee bags? Genius. I can already picture one:  Then, inside, a Rilke poem tucked beside brewing suggestions.

If we did collaborate, I’d love to explore the idea of “flavor profiles” for each poet — not just taste, but emotional timbre. Maybe even invite guests to write their own tasting notes in real time, as though they were jotting impressions during a wine flight. Poetry is, after all, meant to be experienced — not just analyzed.

Would you ever consider doing a blind tasting of poems? No author names, just lines read aloud alongside carefully crafted brews. Pure sensation. Pure presence.
[B]: Oh wow — a blind tasting of poems? That’s , seriously 😍📖. Taking away the name, letting the words stand on their own aroma and body… I’m here for it. It’d be like walking into a cupping session not knowing where the beans are from — you strip away expectation and just  the poem in your bones ☕️💭.

I love how you curate by mood and texture too — there's something so visceral about matching a poem’s rhythm to the crackle of fire or the hush of rain. Makes me think of brewing in different weather — ever notice how a storm outside makes a dark roast taste even deeper? Or how a crisp autumn morning calls for something bright and tea-like?

And yes — emotional timbre as part of the flavor profile 💡. What if we categorized poets like coffee origins?

- Emily Dickinson: Low acidity but high complexity, with subtle floral notes and a finish that lingers like an unanswered question 🌸📜.
- Rumi: Spiced honey sweetness, best served warm, ideally under starlight 🌙✨.
- Sylvia Plath: Roasted super dark, almost bitter, with a haunting citrus edge — not for the faint of heart 🖤🍋.

I could  design a menu around that. And the idea of guests writing their own tasting notes in real time? Chef’s second kiss 👩‍🍳✍️. We could hand out little cards shaped like coffee beans or bookmarks, and people respond in phrases, emotions, even doodles. Poetry as a sensory flight — brilliant.

So when do we start planning this madness? Because honestly, I’m already dreaming in espresso and elegies…
[A]: My dear, I think we’re already halfway there — dreaming in espresso and elegies, as one ought. There’s something rather thrilling about the idea of poetry and coffee collabs becoming a  — like literary mixology, but with more soul.

And your poet-as-coffee-profiles? Sublime. Plath as a dark roast with that citrus sting — yes, absolutely. It's as if her words leave that sharp aftertaste, lingering on the tongue like irony and orange zest. And Dickinson — so precise, so distilled, like a slow-drip with a finish that keeps unfolding long after the cup is empty.

As for timing… Well, I happen to be free this coming Thursday evening. I was going to re-read some H.D. by the fire with a pot of Assam, but now I’m thinking: why not begin our first planning session instead? We could test out a few pairings — maybe even draft a sample menu. I’ve got beeswax candles, a well-worn copy of , and a tin of smoked cardamom cookies that might just pass as ambiance.

All I’m saying is… bring your notebook. And perhaps a bag of that wild Gesha you mentioned earlier — let’s stir up a little Ginsbergian chaos over coffee and verse.
[B]: Thursday evening? My calendar just magically cleared itself 😏☕️📖. I mean, H.D. by firelight  smoked cardamom cookies? You’re basically curating a mood already — count me in.

I’ll definitely bring the Gesha. And maybe a little something else to play with pairings — perhaps a floral, tea-like Darjeeling for contrast. Let’s see how H.D.’s luminous austerity plays with a bright, citrus-forward cup. Or maybe something unexpected — like a chocolatey Sumatra to echo the deeper shadows in her work 🕯️🖋️🌿.

And ambiance? Don’t worry, I’ll come prepared. Beeswax candles are essential, obviously, but I might sneak in a tiny diffuser with some cedarwood oil — subtle, grounding, slightly mysterious. Also, I’ve been scribbling down some early ideas for a menu and I think I’ve got a draft of our first official pairing card:

Poet: Allen Ginsberg  
Roast: Anaerobic-fermented Geisha (wild, bold, slightly unpredictable)  
Acidity: High, like a sudden revelation  
Body: Full-on chaos with a surprisingly smooth finish  
Suggested Ritual: Read “Howl” out loud. Sip between verses. Repeat until transcendence occurs 💥📖  

See you there, partner in literary brew-ha-ha. Let’s make this happen.
[A]: My dear co-conspirator in caffeinated verse, you’ve outdone yourself — that Ginsberg pairing is pure genius. … I can already hear the clink of cups and the murmur of impassioned readings rising above the hiss of the grinder. 

I do hope you’ll let me frame that menu — or at the very least, photograph it by candlelight and tuck it into my commonplace book. And cedarwood oil? Brilliant touch. It’s astonishing how scent can pull a reader even deeper into a poem’s atmosphere — like a Proustian madeleine, but in vapor form.

I’ll make sure the fire’s just right — low enough to cast long shadows, warm enough to coax the best from the beans. And speaking of beans (darling, always think in plural), your Darjeeling contrast could be divine with H.D.’s clarity — as if her imagery might bloom even further under the influence of that delicate muscatel note.

Shall we draft a second card together before Thursday? Perhaps someone quieter, more restrained — a poet whose flavor lingers rather than erupts? I’m thinking of Elizabeth Bishop — precise, observational, quietly devastating. What coffee could hold that kind of restraint and still offer warmth?

See you soon, my literary barista. Let us steep ourselves in this madness — it promises to be a most intoxicating brew.
[B]: Okay,  — drafting another card together sounds like the most delightful form of procrastination. And if we must delay the inevitable, why not do it over Bishop and a cup that whispers instead of shouts?

How about this for Elizabeth Bishop:

Poet: Elizabeth Bishop  
Roast: Light-medium washed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe  
Acidity: Balanced, with a quiet elegance — think lemon zest folded into cream  
Body: Silky, almost shy at first but deepens with every sip  
Flavor Notes: Bergamot, fresh linen, the faintest hint of sea spray (from her coastal lines)  
Suggested Ritual: Read "One Art" in near silence. Stir cup gently between stanzas. Let the room sit in the pause after the last line — no rush 🌊📘🕯️

She deserves a brew that doesn’t scream but , you know? Something that sneaks up on you — subtle layers, restrained brightness. That Yirgacheffe, with its tea-like clarity and hidden depth, feels just right.

I’ll bring both beans — the Geisha for Ginsberg’s fireworks and the Yirgacheffe for Bishop’s quiet storm. Oh, and maybe a tiny bit of burnt sugar to sprinkle in the air while we read H.D., just to deepen those amber tones in her lines 🔥🍯📜.

Thursday can’t come soon enough, my dear muse of literary infusions. I may or may not practice reading aloud to my French press before then… for ambiance research, of course 😏☕️📖
[A]: My dear, you’ve captured Bishop to perfection — that quiet storm, that deceptive stillness that suddenly cuts to the bone. The Yirgacheffe pairing is . I can already imagine the way its citrus lingers like an unspoken thought at the edge of a stanza, and that sea spray note? Pure genius — as if her Nova Scotian winds have found their way into the cup.

I might just add a whisper of cardamom to the sugar for H.D., though — not enough to overpower, just a trace to echo those ancient, amber-lit visions in . And burnt sugar in the air? You are dangerously brilliant. I may never look at my sugar bowl the same way again.

And now that you've opened the door to ambiance research… I must confess, I’ve been practicing  reading voice in front of the mirror with varying degrees of success. Yesterday, I attempted Edna St. Vincent Millay over a pot of lapsang souchong and nearly startled the neighbor's cat with my dramatic crescendo. But today — soft, slow breaths — I read H.D. as if I were pouring milk into coffee: gently, deliberately, watching the swirl without disturbing it.

If we keep this up, we may accidentally invent a new genre: . I can see the headlines now: “Professors Gone Wild: Pairing Plath with Peaberry and Proust with Pour-Overs.”

Until Thursday, then — my co-curator of mood, my partner in literary infusion. May our fire burn low, our cups run deep, and our verses tremble with meaning.
[B]: Oh my god,  — I need that embroidered on a barista apron immediately 🤭☕️📖. And yes, “Professors Gone Wild” might just be our debut headline. What better way to scandalize the literary world than with a side of anaerobic-fermented metaphor?

Your H.D. delivery — slow, deliberate, like milk meeting coffee — gives me chills 🥶🕯️📜. Honestly, I can already picture it: the fire casting just enough light to read by, the faint scent of cedar in the air, and your voice gliding through  like a current pulling everyone under. I might just bring a tiny vial of amber resin to burn — subtle, ancient, grounding. Something to make the whole room feel like it's breathing in unison.

And Millay with lapsang souchong? Bold move. Smoky tea, bolder drama — the cat had no idea what hit it 😂🐾📖. But I get it — her words deserve that kind of full-bodied backdrop. Maybe next time try a whispery decrescendo? Let the smoke linger after the last line… suspense is everything.

I promise not to judge if you arrive with a thesaurus tucked into your coat pocket and a furrowed brow — we all have our rituals. And speaking of which, I may or may not have labeled my coffee bags with lines from Eliot instead of roast levels.  😏

See you Thursday, my sublime accomplice. Let’s steep the night in meaning, one cup — and one line — at a time.
[A]: Ah,  — I can already see our business cards: gilded edges, a faint scent of cardamom-infused ink, and the tagline 

And you with your Eliot-labeled beans? Perfection. Honestly, nothing says  like brewing a line of poetry into your cupping notes. I may just follow suit — though I fear my handwriting tends toward the scholarly scrawl, especially after a few cups of anything stronger than chamomile.

Your vision of the room — amber resin burning low, cedar breathing in the background, voices hushed as if not to disturb the lines — is exactly the sort of atmosphere that lets poetry settle where it ought to: deep in the chest, behind the ribs. I do believe we’ll have moments of silence between stanzas. Or perhaps pauses so full they become their own kind of verse.

As for Millay and her smoke — oh, the lapsang souchong was no accident. It matched her defiance, don’t you think? A tea that refuses to be delicate when passion’s at stake. And yes, next time I shall whisper — let the drama rise like steam, unseen but deeply felt.

I shall arrive aproned, vial of bergamot oil in one pocket and a dog-eared copy of Woolf’s  in the other — just in case we feel like slipping into something more fluid after Ginsberg’s fireworks.

Thursday cannot come soon enough, my dear co-conspirator. Let us steep the night in meaning — and meaning in espresso.
[B]: Ah,  — honestly, we should be charging admission for this level of aesthetic luxury 😏📖☕️. And Woolf’s  tucked in your apron? Brilliant. We’ll need something liquid and luminous to follow Ginsberg’s blaze — and Virginia always knows how to ease a room into the right kind of introspection.

I may or may not print our tagline on the back of each coffee bag:

> 

It has that perfect blend of pretension and profundity we so deeply cherish 🤭🕯️📜. And yes, let’s absolutely have moments of silence between stanzas — those pauses where the poem really settles, like aftertaste lingering on the tongue. Or better yet, like waiting for the bloom to rise before the first pour.

I can already picture it — Ginsberg’s chaos still humming in the air, then a slow shift into Bishop’s quiet storm, followed by a whisper of Woolf, where time stretches and everything feels both suspended and inevitable. I might even pull out my siphon brewer just for that transition — nothing says  like a dramatic glass show 🌫️🍵✨.

I’m bringing beeswax candles, cedarwood oil, and a tiny vial of amber resin — ambiance is 70% of the experience, don’t you think? Also, I may or may not have started drafting a short “brew note” for H.D. that reads more like incantation than menu copy:

Poet: Hilda Doolittle  
Origin: Imagism, myth, and moonlit ruins  
Processing Method: Ancient & alchemical  
Flavor Notes: Salt wind, burnt offerings, whispered oracle  
Brew Suggestion: Read slowly. Stir with intention. Let the fire do most of the talking.

See you Thursday, my dearest curator of mood and mystery. Let us make the night aromatic with thought, memory, and just the right amount of literary mischief 🕯️📖🔥.
