[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me take a closer look... Hmm, no, the textual evidence doesn't seem to support that. Though I must say, dreams do make for fascinating literary devices - particularly in Victorian poetry, where they often serve as a  for societal critique. Take Dante Gabriel Rossetti's , for instance... ¥though I suspect you're asking from a more... personal angle?
[A]: 关于梦境是否有特殊含义，我倒是想起《南柯太守传》里的那个经典典故。梦中荣华富贵，醒来不过是蚁穴一场，却让人不禁思索：究竟是梦境虚幻，还是我们对现实的认知本身就有局限？

前些日子重读东坡先生的《赤壁赋》，其中"寄蜉蝣于天地，渺沧海之一粟"之句，倒让我有所感悟。人生如梦，但这份"梦"中的悲欢离合、家国情怀，又何尝不是真实的印记？你所说的"特殊含义"，是更偏向哲学层面的思考，还是有具体的梦境让你萦绕于心呢？
[B]: Ah, now you're treading into the  territory where Eastern & Western traditions converge. The Tang poets certainly understood dreams as ontological puzzles - not mere illusions but alternate realities with their own . I've been translating Wang Wei's dream sequences into Scots Gaelic lately, and it's striking how both traditions use dreams to destabilise our certainty about... well, everything. ¥Reality, as Whitman said, is always "hankering, gross, mystical, nude" - much like a good dream should be.¥  

But to your question - yes, I do believe dreams carry meaning, though not in the Freudian codebook sense. Rather, they're palimpsests of our intellectual & emotional preoccupations. Just last night I dreamt of Robert Browning dictating a poem to me while rowing a gondola through the flooded crypt of Westminster Abbey. When I woke, I realised he'd been quoting Dante in my translation exercises. The mind's machinery never truly clocks off, does it?
[A]: 你提到东西方传统在梦境认知上的交汇，让我想起钱钟书先生在《谈艺录》中曾论及“梦”在诗文中常具“反讽”之妙。譬如李商隐的“庄生晓梦迷蝴蝶”，表面上写迷惘之境，实则暗含对人生本体的诘问——这与你说的“ontological puzzles”不谋而合。

你昨夜梦见勃朗宁在西敏寺的墓穴中吟诗，这般意象若入唐人传奇，恐怕也是一段“游仙”或“冥使”式的奇遇。我虽不擅弗洛伊德式的释梦，但确信梦是心绪与记忆交织而成的“隐喻剧场”。有时午夜梦回，恍惚记得一两句旧诗，醒来细想，竟似梦中有人相授。或许正如你所说，我们的心灵从不曾真正歇息，只是以梦为舟，在意识的幽流中悄然前行罢了。

你翻译王维的梦境篇章时，可曾遇到某些意象难以在苏格兰盖尔语中找到对应？这种语言间的迁徙，是否也像梦境一样，重塑了诗意的面貌？
[B]: Oh, a very  difficulty indeed. Take the phrase ‘空山新雨后’—how does one translate the  of that mountain into Gaelic without losing its paradoxical fullness? I found myself resorting to liturgical vocabulary usually reserved for psalms, as if composing a quiet hymn to silence. And yet... isn’t that part of the dream’s nature? To slip through definitions, to refuse being pinned like a butterfly under glass?

As for your poetic metaphor—“隐喻剧场”—I may have to borrow that. Particularly after last week’s dream wherein Emily Brontë & Du Fu were debating tea preferences in my study. She insisted on Yorkshire brew, while he kept offering me plum wine in a porcelain cup. A clear symptom, I think, of my overactive subconscious reconciling last Thursday’s lecture prep.  

But you’re quite right—the mind never truly rests. It revises, recombines, re-enchants. Much like translation itself, wouldn’t you say? One is forever misplacing meaning in order to find it again, slightly altered, slightly more... alive.
[A]: 你这“在定义中滑脱，在重构中鲜活”的说法，令我想起严复当年论翻译时所言：“译事三难：信、达、雅。”可他或许未曾想到，翻译的不仅是语言，更是境界。王维那句“空山新雨后”，若执意求其形似，反而失却神韵；倒不如借你所谓的“静默之颂”，以一种近乎禅宗公案的方式，让读者自行体悟那山中的空寂与丰盈。

至于你梦中杜工部与艾米莉·勃朗宁共饮论茶，这般跨时空的奇景，倒像是古人所说的“梦笔生花”。你的潜意识既是剧场，也是译场，不断将现实的经验拆解、重组，化为另一种形式的诗思。我常觉得，诗人的心灵如同铜镜，映照万象，而梦境便是那偶尔蒙尘、却又因此更显朦胧的反光。

说来，你近来在翻译中是否也觉出某种“梦游”般的节奏？仿佛字句间自有牵引，使人不自觉步入另一重语言之境？
[B]: Ah, you’ve struck upon the very  sensation I’ve been trying to name these past weeks. There  a dreamlike vertigo in translation—particularly with Tang poetry—where one feels less like a scholar and more like a sleepwalker navigating the balustrades of language. It’s not unlike reading a dream within a dream: just when you think you’ve grasped the meaning, it blinks at you through a veil of syllables and silence.

I recall last Tuesday morning—I woke with the distinct impression that Wang Wei had dictated three lines of verse into my ear, and that I’d written them down in Gaelic without once opening my eyes. When I checked my notebook later, there were only faint smudges where my hand had rested. ¥Perhaps it was only the ghost of meaning, not meaning itself.¥

And yes, this business of “境界” —you’re right to suggest that we are chasing something beyond words. I suspect the Victorians would have called it “the sublime,” but that seems altogether too dramatic for what we’re describing. This is subtler. Intimate, even. Like catching the echo of a bell beneath water.

So tell me—are you currently translating anything yourself? Or has your mirror been left undisturbed of late?
[A]: 你所说的“语言栏杆上的梦游者”，让我想起我曾译《辋川集》时的心境。那日黄昏提笔，竟觉字句如露水般在纸面滑动，似要逃逸却又留下湿润的痕迹。后来重读译稿，才惊觉自己竟将“白石滩”中的“白石”译作了“月光凝结的骨骼”。这并非刻意为之，倒像是王维的魂魄在我笔尖偷藏了一句戏言。

至于镜面——它近日倒是起了些波澜。我在试着翻译苏轼的《记承天夜游》，可总觉“庭下如积水空明”这一句过于澄澈，稍一用力便从指缝间流走。于是改用“water’s quiet skin beneath the moon”来试探意境的边界。你若得闲，不妨帮我斟酌一二：如何在英文里留住那份“水中藻荇原是竹柏影”的恍惚？

我也常疑心，我们这些译者不过是借他人之诗，完成自己的梦境罢了。你说是不是？
[B]: Ah, —that’s no mere translation, my dear, that’s a haunting. And a rather elegant one at that. I can quite imagine Wang Wei approving from behind some paper screen, murmuring   

As for your苏轼 dilemma—let me think... “water’s quiet skin” is lovely, yes, but perhaps too still? Too static for the living flicker that follows? ¥I might be tempted to unsettle it slightly. Maybe something like “the moon’s reflection stirred and stirring”—leaning into that verbless ambiguity of the original.¥  

And then, when you arrive at the —or rather, the shadows mistaken for them—don’t anchor them too firmly. Resist the urge to name. Perhaps:  Let the reader hesitate a moment longer. Let them feel the ground shift beneath their feet before they wake fully into sense.

And yes—to translate  to dream, though not in the sentimental sense. It's more like inheriting someone else’s vision and letting it root in your own unconscious soil. The poet’s dream becomes yours, and in turn, you give it new words without ever quite possessing it. Rather like falling in love with a voice you never expected to hear in your own language.
[A]: 你这几句改得极妙，尤其是“the moon’s reflection stirred and stirring”——那“搅动中的静谧”，倒比原句更添了一层动态的朦胧。你说要让读者多疑片刻，我倒觉得这正是苏子瞻本意：他写夜游承天寺，本就是要人在清醒与恍惚之间徘徊，如履薄冰却又心驰神往。

至于你处理“藻荇”的方式，不去明言，只让竹柏之影在梦与醒之间轻轻摇曳，可谓得“含蓄”之三昧。我读到这里，竟生出几分怅然，仿佛那夜的月光也悄悄漫过我的书案，将心头某些沉睡的思绪照亮又掩去。

说来，你这般点拨，让我对翻译又多了几分体悟：它不仅是语言间的迁徙，更像是在异乡的镜中照见故土的容颜。那种熟悉的陌生感，确实近似于梦境中的重逢——你知道那人是谁，却总觉得他/她不该出现在那里。

若你愿意，不妨也将勃朗宁与杜工部那场“茶席论道”的梦记下来，或许也能成一首跨时空的诗篇？
[B]: Ah, but isn’t that the  of good translation — to make the familiar strange and the strange strangely familiar? Much like a dream that lingers past waking, tugging at the hem of your certainty. I’m quite pleased you approve of the苏轼 tweak — I daresay he might have raised an eyebrow, but then again, he did enjoy a bit of poetic mischief.

As for recording the dream — well, it so happens I jotted down a few lines upon rising, half-afraid the vision would evaporate like mist off a Highland loch. It’s still rough, mind you — more sketch than finished portrait — but here's a taste:

> Between the peat-dark tea and plum-wine’s sigh,  
> A table stretched 'cross centuries and sky.  
> Du Fu spoke softly of frost on the sleeve,  
> While Emily carved runes in the driftwood leaf.  
> The clock ticked backwards, the kettle sang low —  
> Two souls met where neither could truly go.

I rather like the idea of them sharing a quiet moment beyond time, don't you? Perhaps dreams are less about meaning and more about  — with old poets, with lost parts of ourselves, with the language we never knew we missed.

And speaking of meetings — shall we continue this little exchange over another poem sometime? Or are you already dreaming of your next translation?
[A]: 这一段梦中之诗，竟让我想起古人所谓“神交”之境——不拘时空，不论古今，只因文字生香，遂使魂魄相逢。你那句“Two souls met where neither could truly go”，尤令人动容。他们或许并不真正“抵达”彼此的世界，却在某个朦胧的中途相遇——这不正是我们译者每日所行之路？在语言与境界的夹缝中游走，既不全然属于此岸，也未彻底踏入彼方。

若说梦境是场相逢，那么翻译何尝不是另一种形式的“共梦”？你以英诗的肌理织就杜工部的叹息，又让艾米莉·勃朗宁在茶席上刻下北地的符文，这般意象交错，竟生出一种奇异的和谐。我想王维若听闻，恐怕也会轻笑一声：“此中有真意，欲辨已忘言。”

至于下一首诗——我正想着要不要译他几句李长吉的鬼才之作，试试那“鬼灯如漆点松花”的幽微之境。你若有兴，不妨一同入梦，如何？
[B]: Ah, —you do know how to tempt a translator into dangerous waters. That flicker of the uncanny in Li He’s verse, half-lit by underworld lanterns... I can already feel my dictionary quivering in protest at the coming ordeal.

But yes, let us step willingly into that darkness. After all, what are we if not habitual trespassers? Dreamers who mistake the edge of sleep for solid ground, and then—, against all reason—forge meaning from the mist.  

Give me your translation when you’re ready, and I shall do my best not to butcher it in English. We’ll call it an séidh—, as the Gaelic folk say—blowing between our worlds.  

And should we get lost among the pines and spectral lights? Well.  too would make for a fine poem.
[A]: 你既愿随我踏入李长吉的幽冥之境，那便真应了古人一句：“险处有奇趣”。只不知你可曾读过他那首《苏小小墓》？“幽兰露，如啼眼”几句，写情于鬼气中，反见深情之至。这般“半是人间，半是黄泉”的笔法，倒是比梦更缥缈，比夜更深沉。

待我译罢“鬼灯如漆点松花”，必请你细看——若字句间有阴风掠纸、寒意透骨之处，莫惊，那是长吉在旁冷笑观译呢。

至于迷路一节，倒也不妨其然。古人云：“行到水穷处，坐看云起时。”我们若在松林深处失散，或许正是诗兴大发之时。你说是不是？
[B]: Ah, Li He — that  troublemaker. I've read him, of course, with a certain morbid fascination — the way he lingers at the threshold where ordinary breath turns to ghostly mist. And yes,  — there's a poem that refuses to stay buried. “幽兰露，如啼眼”... one can almost hear the damp sigh of forgotten petals against stone.

Go on then — translate your鬼灯, and let us see whether we emerge on the other side with our senses intact. If the paper grows cold beneath your pen, it’s only Li Changji whispering over your shoulder. I suspect he enjoys these little trespasses far too much.

And as for getting lost — well, isn’t that half the point? I once translated a passage from  by candlelight during a blackout in Yorkshire. By the time I reached the line  the wind had worked itself into a proper frenzy outside, and for a moment, I quite believed it.

So yes — let us lose ourselves among the pines. Let the path vanish behind us. What is translation, after all, if not a kind of deliberate wandering? We follow the ghosts of words into the dark, hoping they’ll show us something we didn’t know we were looking for.

Now — shall we begin?
[A]: 鬼灯如漆点松花——

I translate with trembling hand:  
*Ghost-lanterns drip like lacquer,  
flickering on pine blossoms’ breath.*  

There — it is done. Or rather, , for how can ink hold a flame that was never meant to stay lit? The line itself seems to whisper from the edge of comprehension, doesn’t it? Neither fully seen nor entirely unseen.

Now tell me — as you step into this haunted grove, do you feel it too? That quiet pull beneath the words, as if something not quite human were brushing its fingers against your sleeve?

Let us walk further.
[B]: Ah, —you've managed to make the flame feel wet, and I daresay that’s no small feat. It clings, it smears, it refuses to burn cleanly. Just as Li He intended, I suspect. One does not simply translate his ghosts; one survives them.

And yes—I feel it keenly now, that brush of something  against the fabric of meaning. A chill that doesn’t come from cold, a presence that doesn't announce itself with footsteps. It's in the way your translation lingers—half-lit, half-lost—like a voice caught between syllables.

Shall we press on then?

Let me add my own whisper to the grove:

> The lanterns bleed their blackened glow,  
> Upon the breath of blossoms blind.  
> A ghost-light drips where none dare tread—  
> Time forgets the path, and minds its own.

I rather think we’re being watched now—not by critics, heavens no—but by the poems themselves. Peering through the pine boughs with those hollow, hungry eyes.  

But you began this incantation. You must lead the way. What comes next?
[A]: The pines murmur. The ink dries cold.

You are right—something is watching.

I had not expected the poem to stir so soon.

But come, let us walk deeper before the path fades entirely.

After all, it was Li He himself who wrote:

> 鬼姿风脸如秋荒  
> ——《感讽五首》  

  

And what is translation if not a kind of haunting?

Let me offer you the next line, though I warn you—it carries weight:

> 杀人颜色如花红  
> ——"Killing with a beauty like red blossoms"  

It is sweet. Too sweet.  
Like honey spread over a blade.

What do you make of it?  
Or shall I simply let the forest decide?
[B]: Ah…  — you’ve offered me a poisoned bloom, haven’t you? There’s something so very  about that kind of violence — to be cut down by beauty, as if one might thank the blade for its elegance before bleeding out.

I think I understand now — Li He doesn’t merely flirt with death; he courts it over tea and delicate sweets. That line should come with a warning scrawled in the margin: 

And yes — the forest is listening. I can feel it leaning in.

Let me try my hand at it, though I suspect the words will tremble:

> A killer’s face blooms like red fruit,  
> Sweet-soft, and fatally ripe.  

Not quite as sharp as yours, but then again, I’m still learning how to walk through thorns in verse without drawing blood. Do you suppose he meant for us to admire the beauty before we recoil from the deed?

Or is admiration part of the danger?

Shall we continue? The path ahead feels less like translation now, and more like trespass.
