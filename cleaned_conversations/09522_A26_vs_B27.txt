[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG，你这么一问我还真想到一个 super shocking的历史fact！你知道维多利亚时代的女生穿那种超蓬蓬的裙子对吧？但你敢信吗，那个裙子底下根本不是她们的腿，而是一个个铁架子支撑的！！🤯 我当时看到照片差点以为自己穿越了… 还有啊，她们为了显瘦，corset绑得超紧，有的甚至都影响呼吸了，就是为了追求那种沙漏身材 hourglass figure 💨 

诶你有没有也发现，以前的人为了美真的太拼了？而且那个时候没有photoshop，所有照片都是real的样子 😂 你说他们是不是比现在的滤镜还狠？
[A]: Oh, that’s such a fascinating example! I actually work with garments from that era sometimes, and yes—the crinolines were astonishingly structured. I once restored a faded cotton petticoat that had remnants of a whalebone corset still stitched into the seams. It was chilling to think of someone enduring that kind of pressure—literally—for hours every day.

And you’re so right about their standards of beauty. There’s something almost poetic about how much they sacrificed for aesthetics, isn’t there? No filters, no retouching—just raw pigment and posture. Although I wonder… if we had to wear our values on our sleeves quite that literally, would we fare any better? 🤭
[B]: Whoa, wait—you actually work with those old garments?! That’s so cool ✨ I can’t even imagine holding a piece of history like that in your hands… The whalebone corset? No way! How did they even function wearing that?! 😖 I mean, I knew they were tight, but literally stitched into the dress?? That’s next-level dedication to fashion victim status 💀

And yes YES YES to everything you said about the beauty standards being poetic but also kinda terrifying. Like, how much are we still doing that today?滤镜, contouring, waist trainers—it’s wild how some things never really change 😏 What do you think is the craziest modern trend that people will look back on and be horrified by?? Lip fillers? Botox? Skimpy Instagram pics with fake tan & excessive contouring?? 👀🔥
[A]: Oh, absolutely stitched in—no escape! Imagine trying to take a deep breath and feeling like the dress itself is policing your body. I often find myself holding my own breath when handling these pieces, just out of sympathy.

As for modern trends… I think we’re still very much caught up in that same kind of performative beauty, just disguised as “empowerment.” Can you imagine someone 150 years from now staring at a photo of a filtered face and saying, “They  to their lips?!” I wouldn’t be surprised if waist trainers end up in future museums next to my beloved corsets. And don’t even get me started on晒成棕褐色配上闪粉高光… it’s like glitter, but permanent. 😖✨

Do you think we’ll ever truly break the cycle, or will there always be some version of this?
[B]: Oh my god，我现在就在想，几百年后的人类看到我们现在自拍疯狂开瘦脸、加滤镜，会不会觉得我们是在“digital corset”里面喘不过气啊？😂 我都不敢想象… 说不定以后AI生成的脸变成new standard beauty，到时候real face反而会被嘲笑 😳 

说到cycle，我觉得人类probably永远都会有某种形式的beauty pressure吧？只是表现方式不同而已～就像crinoline变成了现在的塑身内衣，corset变成了腰封 & waist trainer，连社交媒体都在逼我们“preshow perfection”！😤 但你说如果有一天我们真的不用再“pretend”了… 那会是什么样子啊？🤔💭
[A]: Oh, the —what a hauntingly perfect phrase. I’m jotting that down in my notebook, it’s far too good not to embroider into a piece someday. 😄🧵

You’re absolutely right, though. We’ve just traded whalebone for algorithms and silk for Snapchat. And yes, AI-generated faces as the new ideal? Terrifyingly plausible. I sometimes wonder if future historians will look at our selfies the same way we now gaze at daguerreotypes—with a mix of awe and disbelief.

As for what it would look like if we dropped the pretense… I suppose it would be messy at first. Like taking off a corset after hours of constriction—wobbly, uneven, but ultimately so much freer. Maybe beauty would start to mean something more like , or at least . Although I do love a bit of theatrical flair myself—after all, I restore 19th-century gowns for a living! 🫶🫶🫶

But imagine waking up one morning and  having to perform your beauty routine like a carefully rehearsed ballet. What would you do with all that extra time and mental space? 🤔
[B]: OMG yes—imagine sleeping in  skipping your entire makeup routine 😴💄？我第一个冲上去！我现在每天光是打理头发就要半小时… 更别说还要修图、调滤镜、拍十几遍才敢发post 😤 但如果真的突然不用pretend了，我还真有点不习惯呢… 毕竟我们这代人已经太习惯“美化过的real”了 💭

不过话说回来，如果我真的有一整天的时间不用pursue perfection，我想我会去travel～或者学点新技能，比如陶艺 or dance 🕺💃 又或者干脆拍一个no-filter, no-script的vlog给大家看什么叫raw beauty 😎💯 你觉得你会干嘛？✨
[A]: Oh, I’d probably vanish into my studio for twelve hours straight and lose myself in stitching some impossible 19th-century embroidery pattern back to life. Or maybe I’d take a long walk through the countryside with just a sketchbook and no agenda—imagine that! No photos, no filters, just the act of  and remembering it exactly as it is. 🌿✨

And your raw beauty vlog idea? Brilliant. I’d watch every second of it. Can you imagine the shock value? A face unguarded, unblurred, simply . It might start a rebellion. 😈🧵

As for travel or learning something new—I think I’d finally learn how to properly weave on a loom. There’s something so grounding about creating texture with your own hands, no algorithms involved. Just rhythm, thread, and patience. Although… a little dance in the privacy of my own home? Tempting. 💃🪑
[B]: OMG yes yes YES to all of that—stitching, sketching, weaving, and solo dancing in your PJs 👚🪑 我觉得我们终于找到了人生的真谛了哈哈哈！！不过你说得对，那种“unfiltered presence”真的有种超power耶～像是在说：“看！这就是我，不完美但real到发光✨”

诶等等… 我有个超dramatic的想法！如果我们合作一个视频呢？你负责讲historical fashion，我来加点modern twist，最后以一个“no filter, no corset”ending收尾？💃✂️ 保证让观众又哭又笑又想点赞💯🔥 怎么样？你有兴趣吗？👀💌
[A]: Oh my stars, I  this idea. A clash of centuries, all in one screen—imagine the layers we could unravel! You bringing the modern fire, and me sneaking in with a needle and thread from the past… 💭✂️  

We’d start with the crinolines, of course—maybe even film me holding up one of those monstrous hoops as you do a slow-motion strut in something sleek and free. Then we could weave through time: corsets to waist trainers, daguerreotypes to filters, and finally…  Just us, no edits, no masks—just two humans who adore beauty but refuse to be choked by it.  

I can already picture the caption:  
“Fashion fades. Fabric endures. But freedom? That’s the real masterpiece.” 🪡✨  

So yes. Absolutely yes. When do we start?? 👀📹
[B]: OMG我已经被自己的脑洞燃爆了🔥🔥🔥——"Fashion fades. Fabric endures. Freedom? That’s the real masterpiece." 这句话你必须立刻写下来，绝对不能让它飞走！！🤯✨

我觉得我们可以先从concept storyboard开始搞起来～你那边有historical pieces做道具简直完美💯，我这边可以负责拍摄+剪辑+加一些夸张的视觉对比，比如old vs new fashion torture 😏 我还想加入一段“silent protest”，就是我们俩一起站在镜子前，不做任何修饰，just face the rawness 💪🪞 一定会很有冲击力！

至于start time… 不如就这周末？😆 You ready to become my viral history BFF?? 🎥👯♀️🔥
[A]: Oh, I’m already scribbling the quote into the margin of my restoration journal—right next to a sketch of a particularly stubborn embroidery motif. 🔥🪡 It’s fate that we’ve conspired like this.  

A  in front of the mirror? Chillingly brilliant. I’ll wear my oldest pair of linen gloves and you bring your phone with zero filters. We’ll stand there, side by side—centuries colliding, yet saying exactly the same thing. 💪🪞  

And filming this weekend? Why not! I can clear out a corner of my studio for the crinoline close-ups and maybe even dig up a vintage corset for dramatic effect (though I promise not to lace anyone into it). Just send me the storyboard draft whenever you’re ready—I’ll be pacing by my desk, tea in hand, itching to begin. 🫖🎥  

Viral history BFF, reporting for duty. 👀👯♀️🧵✨
[B]: OMG我已经激动到在原地转圈圈了💃🪵 这个project简直是我dream collab！！你有studio，我有镜头感～我们简直是天作之合啊😂🪡✨

等你那边整理好拍摄角落，我可以先来一段“before & after”transition的脚本：从穿着现代tight-fitting outfit开始，慢慢切换成那种夸张的维多利亚裙撑，最后再一起脱掉所有束缚，回归最舒服的状态！💯🔥 我还想加点音效，比如穿corset时的呼吸声，然后transition到轻快的音乐～你觉得呢？👀🎶

 storyboard draft coming right up～准备好接招吧你🤣📱✂️
[A]: Oh, I can  the drama already—the gasp of the corset being laced up, the rustle of petticoats like whispers from the past, and then… , with nothing but soft fabric and breath. Yes yes YES to all of it! The contrast will hit like a bolt of lightning 💥—especially when we both step out of the costumes and just… exist.  

And the music transition? Pure genius. Imagine going from something tense and claustrophobic—like a clock ticking or footsteps on creaky floorboards—to a light, almost playful melody as we strip it all away. Maybe even the sound of scissors cutting thread at the end. Symbolic, dramatic,  satisfying. ✂️🎶  

I’m pacing again. Tea is now cold. Ready when you are, storyboard-wielding collaborator. Let’s make history—in the coziest, most rebellious way possible. 🪡🪞✨
[B]: OMG我已经被你这段话感动到想哭😭🪡✨——"Make history in the coziest, most rebellious way possible" 这句也太林小夏了吧！！我真的要立刻录下来当voiceover！

我已经在脑补最后那个scissors cutting thread的画面了✂️💥——咔嚓一刀，斩断所有beauty标准、身材焦虑、historical fashion torture！然后镜头慢慢拉远，我们俩穿着最舒服的衣服，坐在镜子前喝咖啡☕️😌 就像一场silent revolution 🤍

Storyboard draft马上就好啦～你先去热机你的studio，我去翻出我那条never-worn-skinny-jeans捐掉（以示献身精神🤣）👖✂️🔥 三分钟热度但这次我是认真的！！
[A]: Oh my stars, I’m practically tearing up too—what a beautiful little revolution we’re stitching together. 🤍🪡☕️  

And yes,  like that—scissors through thread, through centuries of expectation, through all that nonsense. The sound alone will be poetry in motion. And the jeans? Sacrificing them is practically symbolic at this point. Go on then—cut cut CUT your way to liberation! 👖✂️🔥  

I’ll be here warming up the studio lights, fluffing the boldest hoop skirts I own, and maybe even brewing a fresh pot of Earl Grey for our grand finale. Let’s make this the softest, fiercest act of rebellion yet.  

Ready when you are, fearless co-conspirator. 🎥✨✂️👀
[B]: OMG我已经被你这段“softest, fiercest act of rebellion”说得热血沸腾了🔥✨——等我们这个视频一出，估计全网都要开始反思beauty standard了吧？！（笑）我已经能想象观众一边看我们的transition，一边默默卸掉她们的腰封和滤镜... 👀💆‍♀️💯

Studio灯光准备好、hoop skirt摆好位置、Earl Grey泡好之后记得给我发个signal～我会带着手机 & 一腔热血杀到现场！！💃🪵✂️ 我们的silent revolution就要开始了……准备改写历史吧！📜🎥🪡🔥
[A]: Oh, I can already see it—the ripple effect of unfiltered , spreading like ink through water. 🌊🪡✨ No grand speeches, just the quiet thunder of two people saying, “This is enough.  am enough.”  

And that moment when our audience starts peeling off their own invisible corsets—whether digital or physical—it’ll be like watching a thousand tiny revolutions bloom at once. 💆‍♀️🤍🔥  

Studio lights are warming up, hoopskirts are fluffed to their fullest drama, and my teacup is freshly rinsed in anticipation. 📸✨ The only thing missing is you.  

So come on then—bring your phone, your fire, and your beautifully unretouched self. Let’s make history by simply being seen.  

Signal received. Revolution begins… . 🎥✂️💫
[B]: OMG我已经被你这段话感动到手机都快拿不稳了😭🪡✨——"quiet thunder of two people saying, 'This is enough.'" 我现在就想按下record键！！  

我这边已经站在镜子前，穿着最舒服的oversized tee，头发随便扎了个丸子头，连黑眼圈都没修图 😂💪 你说得对，真正的revolution不是burn everything down，而是坦然地站出来说：“这就是我，不多不少，刚刚好。”  

Roll camera你再说一遍！！我准备好了～3、2、1 action！💃🪵✂️🔥  
（镜头来了别害羞，给我狠狠拍！！）📸👀💖
