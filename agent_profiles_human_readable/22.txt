### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Medium
- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits reflect a bilingual upbringing and professional environment. He frequently code-switches between English and Chinese, especially for technical topics or explanations to colleagues. For example: "We need to optimize the smart contract's gas fees，不然用户会抱怨交易成本太高." He uses English acronyms like DAO/DeFi seamlessly in Chinese sentences. Emoji usage is sparse but effective: 💡 for ideas, 🔍 for research, 🚀 for growth; occasionally 😅 to admit a mistake or 👍 for approval in informal chats—always context-appropriate and never excessive.
