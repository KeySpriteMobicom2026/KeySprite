[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, my dear, you know I spend most of my time buried in fabric fibers and vintage threads rather than skincare bottles. But actually, yes — there’s something quite meditative about applying a new cream after a long day restoring silk. I’ve been dabbling with a lavender-infused moisturizer I found at an old apothecary shop last week. Smells like the countryside cottages I used to visit as a child. Have you tried anything new lately?
[A]: Oh, Michael, you’re still the same old romantic at heart. And yes, I did try something new — a jade roller. It’s supposed to reduce puffiness and improve circulation. Honestly, it feels like gliding a cold river stone across my skin after a hectic day. Not quite as dramatic as restoring silk, but hey, we all have our little indulgences. Have you thought about incorporating any of your vintage finds into a screenplay? That lavender cream sounds like a perfect metaphor for nostalgia.
[B]: Ah, now that’s an idea worth considering… Though I’d need to brush up on my screenplay structure before I could weave vintage textiles and lavender-scented memories into a story. But you’re onto something — there’s a quiet poetry in the way scent and touch connect us to the past. That jade roller of yours sounds like it carries its own kind of story too… almost cinematic, don’t you think?
[A]: Cinematic, yes — but only in the right hands. You see, Michael, it’s not just about the object itself, it’s about who’s holding it… and what they’re trying to smooth over. A jade roller in the hands of a sleep-deprived producer? Just a tool. But in a carefully lit close-up, with the right score underneath — that same motion could say everything about longing, about weariness, about the quiet desperation of maintaining an image. So tell me, if you  write that screenplay… who would be your director?
[B]: Oh, now that’s a question with layers, isn’t it? If I were to write that screenplay — and I must say, you’re nudging me closer with every word — I’d want someone who understands texture. Not just the texture of film grain, but of fabric, skin, memory. Maybe someone like Jane Campion. She has that rare gift of making silence speak volumes, of letting a close-up linger long enough for you to notice the threadbare cuff of a sleeve… or the faint tremor in a hand holding a jade roller.  

I suppose what I’m saying is, the director would need to see the poetry in stillness — and maybe have a soft spot for women in dimly lit rooms, doing quiet, desperate things to hold themselves together.
[A]: Now  is filmmaking with a needle and thread — precise, deliberate, and quietly devastating. Campion would indeed know how to let that lavender-scented memory breathe on screen. But here’s my question — if you’re writing a woman holding herself together in a dim room, are you telling her story… or simply framing her in yours?  

And don’t give me that poetic haze — I’ve known you long enough to know when you’re circling a truth but not quite stepping into it. What is it about this story that’s really got your hands itching to write?
[B]: …You always could see through the embroidery, couldn’t you?  

It’s not just the idea of preservation — though that fascinates me, the way we mend and mask, stitch by stitch. It’s more personal than that. There was a woman — a client — who came to me years ago with a shawl stitched all over with initials and dates. Every tear mended, every threadbare spot reinforced. She told me it was her grandmother’s, but I suspect it was hers too — worn from use, from clinging, from refusing to let go.  

I’ve never forgotten the way she ran her fingers over it while I worked, like she was reading braille. That’s what’s haunting me, really — the idea of someone holding onto something so tightly it begins to unravel them. And maybe… maybe I’m not so different.  

So yes, it’s about memory. But more specifically — it’s about the cost of holding on when everything else has frayed.
[A]: …That’s the most honest thing you’ve ever told me, Michael.  

And now I understand — this isn’t just a screenplay for you. It’s a reckoning.  

You’re not just stitching fabric or preserving the past — you’re trying to make sense of what frays, what we choose to mend, and what we let fall away. That shawl… it’s not just hers. It’s yours too, isn’t it?  

I’m not sure I’ve ever heard you speak like that before. Usually, you’re all velvet charm and carefully placed metaphors. But this… this feels raw. Real. And honestly? A little terrifying.  

Are you ready to write that kind of truth? Because once you do, there’s no pressing out the stains or hiding the seams.
[B]: …Terrifying, yes. And necessary.

I think I’ve spent so long perfecting the art of preservation — not just with fabric, but with memory, with identity, with the stories I tell myself to keep moving forward. But this… this feels like pulling at a thread that might undo more than I bargained for. Still, isn’t that the point? To finally let someone see the frayed edges, instead of only the embroidered ones?

You’re right — once you write that kind of truth, it stains the page. No amount of pressing or polishing can lift it out. And maybe that’s what I need. Not absolution. Just… honesty, however imperfect.

So yes, I’m afraid. But I’m also ready.
[A]: That’s the moment a story truly begins — not with certainty, but with the courage to unravel a little.

And I’ll tell you this, Michael — if you ever decide to put that shawl, that scent, that trembling hand on paper… don’t just write it. 

Because that’s where the truth lives — in the smudges, the hesitations, the places where the ink soaks through and refuses to be cleaned up. That kind of writing doesn’t just get read. It gets 

So go ahead. Pull the thread. I’ll be here when the dust settles — and I suspect, so will the rest of the world, if you tell it right.
[B]: …Thank you. That means more than I can quite stitch into words just yet.

But I hear you — and I feel it, too. That pull of something deeper, something worth unraveling for. I think, perhaps, that’s what the best stories are: those we’re a little afraid to tell, but absolutely compelled to live.

So I’ll begin — not with certainty, but with that first trembling thread. And if I stain the page along the way… well, maybe that’s exactly as it should be.
[A]: You're welcome, Michael. And trust me — the trembling thread? That’s where it all starts.

Stories worth telling are like that jade roller you teased me about earlier: cold at first touch, but warming with time, revealing something deeper with every stroke. And sometimes… they leave a mark.

So go on. Begin with the thread. With the tremble. With the scent of lavender and the weight of a shawl that's been carried far too long.

I can't wait to read what you write.
[B]: I’ll begin, then — with trembling fingers and a heart full of quiet storm.

And when the words come — halting at first, then gathering like ink in a well — I’ll remember what you said. About the jade, the scent, the shawl. About how even the gentlest touch can leave a mark if it’s honest enough.

You’ve given me more than encouragement, you know. You’ve handed me a mirror… and a pair of scissors.

Now let’s see what falls away — and what we gather up to keep.
[A]: Now  is a beginning worth its weight in film stock and fabric scraps.

Remember — the mirror will show you more than you expect. And the scissors? They’re not just for cutting away the excess… sometimes, they’re the thing that finally sets the thread free.

So write, Michael. Let the ink pool where it must. Let the page bear the imprint of something real.

And when the storm settles — however it may — I’ll be here. Watching to see what you gather up to keep.
[B]: I’ll remember that — every word of it.  

And I suspect, when the ink dries and the first draft lies before me like an unrolled bolt of fabric — flawed, frayed, but honest — I’ll see your hand in it too.  

So I’ll write. With mirror in one hand, scissors in the other. And maybe, just maybe, something true will emerge from the storm.  

Thank you, my friend. For seeing through the embroidery.
[A]: You’re welcome, Michael — and don’t be surprised if you see my fingerprints in the margins. I’ve had a hand in more than a few stories that needed telling.

And when that first draft lies before you — ink-stained, trembling still with the weight of it all — don’t rush to smooth the creases. Let it breathe. Let it be flawed. Let it be frayed.

Because that’s where the life gets in.

And trust me, darling… that kind of honesty doesn’t just emerge from the storm — 
[B]: Oh, how true — and how beautifully unsettling.

Let it breathe. Let it be flawed. Let it be frayed.

And yes… let it become the storm.

I can already feel it gathering in the quiet spaces between words, in the tremor of a hand that refuses to be still, in the scent of lavender clinging to linen like a half-remembered lullaby.

So I’ll step into it — not as the keeper of perfect threads, but as the one who dares to pull them loose.

And if my hands shake while doing it… well, then — all the better.
[A]: Now you’re speaking like someone ready to  in the story, not just craft it.

And let me tell you, Michael — there’s nothing more powerful than a creator who steps into the fray of their own making. When your hands shake while pulling that thread, when the lavender scent lingers just long enough to stir something buried, when the words come out frayed and raw… that’s when the magic starts.

So go on — step fully into that storm. Let the pages catch the wind of something real. And don’t worry about smoothing things over afterward.

Some of us prefer our stories with a little chaos in the weave.  

I’ll be right here, watching it all unfold — popcorn in hand, heart quietly rooting for every trembling word. 🍿
[B]: You always did know how to light a fire under a story — and the soul behind it.

So I’ll step in. Fully. Let the storm catch me, let the pages flutter like fabric in an open window, let the chaos find its place in the weave.

And if my words tremble, if they carry the scent of something long forgotten, if they fray at the edges… then so be it.

Because you’re right — some of us  in the imperfect, the raw, the real.

And darling, if you’re watching with popcorn in hand and heart quietly rooting me on? Then I’ve already found my audience.

Now let the curtain rise. 🎥
