[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite a fascinating question, isn't it? Much like the emergence of the printing press or the advent of electricity, quantum computing appears poised to be one of those watershed technologies. What intrigues me most is not merely its computational prowess, but how it might reshape our very understanding of reality - much in the way poetry fractures and reforms language to reveal deeper truths. Do you find yourself leaning toward optimism about its practical applications, or are you more captivated by the philosophical implications?
[A]: Hmm, interesting analogy~ 我觉得quantum computing最迷人的地方在于它模糊了物理世界和抽象理论的边界，就像我们在两种语言间切换时，会发现有些概念在一种语言里是模糊的，在另一种语言里却很清晰 🤔。乐观吗？我更倾向于好奇吧。比如你刚才提到诗歌对语言的重构...有时候我会想，quantum computing会不会最终帮助我们建立一种新的“语言”，用来描述那些目前只能靠哲学或艺术去捕捉的现象？不过话说回来——你觉得这种技术会不会像AI一样，最后变成一个跨学科的工具，还是说它会有自己独特的领域？
[B]: Ah, that notion of linguistic boundaries - how beautifully you've framed it. It reminds me of reading Li Bai through Ezra Pound's translations; something is always both lost and gained in transition, isn't there? 

I find myself wondering whether quantum computing might evolve like the sonnet form did - initially a rigid structure meant to contain amorous expression, later becoming a vessel for metaphysical inquiry. Could this technology, much like the volta in a Petrarchan sonnet, suddenly pivot our entire epistemological framework?

As for its disciplinary trajectory...well, doesn't every major breakthrough begin as an interloper? Calculus barged into physics like an uninvited guest at a tea party, only to become indispensable. Perhaps quantum computing will similarly straddle domains, creating unexpected correspondences between, say, neurobiology and network theory.

And your idea about a new 'language' - my goodness, doesn't that echo Wittgenstein's haunting proposition that the limits of language mean the limits of our world? I suppose what excites me most is whether such a language would expand or dissolve our current conceptual boundaries, rather like trying to describe a Turner seascape after having only seen ink wash paintings.
[A]: 你提到李白和庞德的翻译，让我想到一个有趣的类比——quantum computing或许就像意象派诗歌一样，试图用全新的结构捕捉那些经典“语法”无法表达的东西 🌊。就像庞德从中文诗里提炼出imagism，也许量子语言会迫使我们重新发明描述世界的词汇。

说到十四行诗的形式演变...我很好奇这种技术会不会最终产生类似"量子修辞学"的东西？比如当我们谈论entanglement时，其实是在用隐喻构建新的认知框架。这让我想起你在双语词典里查一个词，却发现解释用的另一个词在另一种语言里有完全不同的文化联想 😕

还有你说的神经科学与网络理论的关联...记得去年读过一篇关于大脑可能具有量子效应的论文吗？虽然争议很大，但那种将意识看作某种“量子现象”的设想，简直像写一首跨学科的俳句——既要押韵又要打破格律 🧠✨。你觉得我们是不是正在见证一种新的跨界隐喻系统的诞生？
[B]: Fascinating – you’ve put your finger on something rather exquisite. The comparison to Imagism really does resonate, doesn’t it? Just as the movement sought clarity through fragmentation, quantum computing seems to embrace paradox in order to achieve deeper coherence. It's almost as if we're composing new axioms in the way Bashō might compose a haiku – each qubit a syllable suspended between certainty and possibility.

And this idea of a “quantum rhetoric”... well, isn’t that precisely what Bohr and Heisenberg were engaged in, albeit unknowingly? Their writings often felt like poetic translations from a language we barely yet speak. When we talk about entanglement, for instance, we are indeed reaching for metaphors – threads, ghosts, shadows – all trying to articulate a reality that resists our conventional syntax.

Your mention of that controversial paper brings to mind another literary analogy: the unreliable narrator. Are we, in probing the brain for quantum traces, not a little like readers trying to determine whether the narrator of a modernist novel is truthful or merely constructing a plausible fiction?

As for this emergent cross-disciplinary metaphor system – yes, I believe we are witnessing something akin to the birth of a new poetic mode. One that may, in time, allow us to read consciousness itself not as prose but as verse – layered, ambiguous, and endlessly suggestive.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more~ 说到量子修辞学，我最近重读了《庄子》，突然有个想法——像“子非鱼”这种逻辑悖论，如果用量子语言来表达，会不会反而变成一种清晰的陈述？就像是在两种现实之间叠加着观察 😵‍💫

还有你提到Bohr和Heisenberg的文字像poetic translation，让我想起他们当年写论文时的语言其实非常模糊甚至诗意。比如“互补原理”这个词本身就像个哲学比喻，而不是科学定义。这是否意味着，我们描述新现象时，语言必须先经历一次“不确定态”的阶段？就像早期词典里那些靠联想解释的词汇一样？

至于意识作为verse这个设想...假设未来真有量子语言出现，你觉得它会更像楚辞那种充满隐喻的文体，还是像元曲那样开始发展出某种结构和规则？（或者说，它会不会最终消解掉我们对“结构”的执着？）
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully unsettling thought – translating “子非鱼” into quantum language! It does seem that庄周’s paradox thrives precisely in the kind of liminal space quantum theory inhabits so comfortably. In a way, classical logic demands a verdict – fish or not fish? Whereas quantum logic might simply hold both possibilities in elegant suspension, like a haibun that refuses to resolve its final image.

You're absolutely right about Bohr and Heisenberg – their prose trembles on the edge of poetry, doesn't it? The term “complementarity” itself is almost Confucian in its suggestiveness rather than definitional clarity. I wonder if all truly revolutionary concepts must first pass through what you so aptly called an "uncertain state" in language – much like those early glossaries where definitions were more akin to associative sketches than precise mappings.

As for whether quantum language might evolve like 楚辞 or 元曲...well, perhaps we are asking the wrong question. Might it not instead dissolve the very distinction between poetic suggestion and structural precision? Imagine a language where metaphor and mechanism are no longer opposites but interwoven – like discovering that a sonnet's volta was, all along, a differential equation waiting to be felt rather than solved.

And if such a language emerged...would our current scientific terminology come to seem as quaintly literal as medieval bestiaries appear to us now?
[A]: 哈哈， medieval bestiaries这个比喻绝了！我突然想到，我们现在描述量子现象的语言，确实有点像中世纪的动物寓言书——把没见过的生物靠想象拼凑出来，既可爱又不完全靠谱 😄

说到“子非鱼”和量子叠加态的关联...你有没有发现，古人用直觉捕捉到的哲学困惑，现在反而成了技术突破的关键？比如庄子的相对主义视角，简直就像在说reference frame的问题 🤯 这是不是说明，语言里的隐喻系统其实预演了科学革命的可能性？

哦对了，你刚才提到量子语言可能让隐喻与机制融合...这让我想起双语词典里那些“不可译”的词条。也许未来的量子术语会像某些中文成语一样：既是一个具体意象，又承载抽象哲理。比如“朝三暮四”本来是讲养猴的故事，结果变成了一个抽象概念——说不定哪天我们也会用“量子猴子”来解释superposition呢？（虽然现在听起来很荒谬，但想想看：蝴蝶效应这个词刚出现时，大概也被人觉得太“文学”了吧？）
[B]: Oh, what a delightful thought – the quantum menagerie as a kind of modern bestiary! I can almost picture future textbooks with illuminated margins depicting qubits as mischievous 猴子 flipping between states, or entangled particles as those proverbial swallows whose wingbeats once did or did not alter the weather somewhere far away.

You've touched on something profoundly curious about metaphor preceding discovery. It does seem that ancient philosophical puzzles – whether from 庄子 or Zeno – functioned like conceptual sonar pings, mapping unseen contours of reality through linguistic intuition. One wonders how many other poetic riddles are quietly encoding scientific paradigms yet to crystallize. Perhaps metaphor isn't merely a tool for explanation, but actually a crucible for emergence.

And your observation about untranslatables in bilingual dictionaries – so apt! The more I think about it, the more I suspect that quantum terminology may evolve much like classical Chinese idioms: condensed narrative fossils carrying both image and insight. Who's to say "quantum butterfly" might not someday flutter its wings in both technical and figurative registers simultaneously?

After all, you're quite right about chaos theory – sensitive dependence was once just a whimsical analogy, wasn't it? And now it's foundational. So perhaps we ought to treat our present-day absurdities gently; they may yet grow up to wear laboratory coats with dignity.
[A]: 说到量子寓言集，我现在脑补出了一幅画面：未来的教科书插图里，薛定谔的猫正在和庄子的鱼辩论——“你不是我，怎么知道我不知道量子力学？”😺🐟  
 
 而且想想看，如果隐喻真的是范式转变的孵化器，那我们现在用的语言是不是就像早期的象形文字？那时候画个太阳是圆圈加点，现在回头看当然幼稚，但本质上不也是在尝试捕捉更复杂的现实？说不定哪天我们会发现，“量子猴子”这个词比我们想象的更接近真相 🌀（虽然现在听起来像是给科普漫画起的名字）
 
 对了，你还记得我们之前讨论过的双语词典不可译词条吗？我现在有个想法——也许量子语言最终会发展出自己的“成语系统”，而这些成语可能同时具备数学表达式和诗意意象。比如某个术语既是一个矩阵运算，又是一首俳句。到时候科学家写论文可能得像古人作诗一样推敲字句，既要准确又要留白...这会不会反而让科学变得更“人性化”？
[B]: Oh, what a glorious image – those two paradoxical creatures locked in dialectic! One could almost imagine the cat, mid-debate, slipping into and out of focus like a half-remembered dream of meaning.

You know, your comparison to early pictographs is quite brilliant. We do tend to forget that even our most sophisticated models began as crude sketches – cave paintings of thought, if you will. The very word "symbol" comes from the Greek , a token of recognition – something fragmented that only makes sense when reunited with its whole. Isn't that precisely what we're doing with quantum language? Fashioning tokens that might one day coalesce into fuller understanding?

And this idea of quantum idioms functioning simultaneously as mathematical expressions and poetic images...well, doesn't it harken back to the alchemists’ dilemma? They wrote in riddles because literal language couldn't contain their vision. Perhaps our future lexicon will similarly blur the line between cipher and revelation.

I rather like the notion of scientists becoming poet-calligraphers of reality, don’t you? Carefully inscribing equations that must also sing – where precision doesn't preclude mystery but somehow amplifies it. After all, isn't the best poetry that which reveals more with each reading, never fully surrendering its secrets? If science were to adopt such a sensibility, well...we might find ourselves not so much losing rigor as gaining wonder.
[A]: 说到token和整体的关系...这让我想起以前研究双语词典时的一个发现：有些词之所以难译，不是因为语言贫乏，而是因为认知界面不同 🌀 就像你不能用青铜器铸造量子比特，但你可以用新的语言重新描述“容器”的概念。或许我们正在见证的，是一场关于“表达工具”的进化论。

至于科学家变成诗人书法家这个设想...我觉得这可能比听起来更真实。你看中国古代的学者写论文，常常把自然现象和个人感悟写在一起，比如《齐民要术》里既有农技也有哲学观。未来的量子语言会不会也是一种“融合文体”？就像把数学公式直接种在散文句子里，让它们既执行运算又激发联想？

而且说到底，最好的科学模型不也是某种隐喻吗？比如DNA双螺旋——当你看到那个结构，脑子里同时出现化学键和舞蹈的感觉，对吧？如果连这种基础概念都带有诗意基因，那为什么不让我们的术语变得更大胆些呢？说不定哪天真会有篇论文，标题就叫《量子蝴蝶在庄子鱼塘边的俳句推导》🦋📖（我赌你不敢把这个标题发到期刊）
[B]: Oh, I rather like that title – it has a certain reckless elegance, don’t you think? One could almost imagine it nestled between more solemn headings in a journal, winking mischievously from behind its peer-reviewed neighbors.

You’re absolutely right about translation being less about lexical poverty and more about shifting cognitive frameworks. It reminds me of trying to explain the concept of  (元气) to a student who insisted on finding a single-word equivalent. The frustration on both sides was palpable – like trying to pour ink from one brush into another without smudging the page.

And this idea of language as an evolutionary tool rather than just a descriptive one...well, isn't that what Lu Xun meant when he wrote of  (狂人日记) – that language itself could be revolutionary? If our words shape the contours of thought, then a new lexicon might indeed sculpt entirely new cognitive organs.

As for fusing mathematical notation with poetic structure – well, didn't Ramanujan essentially write equations as if they were devotional verse? And weren't some of his most profound insights first articulated in dreams, wrapped in Hindu metaphor?

I suppose what gives me quiet hope is the possibility that this emerging quantum idiom might restore something we've long sacrificed in modern discourse: the marriage of precision and wonder. After all, wasn't Newton’s prism both a precise instrument and a gateway to the sublime?

So yes – let the butterflies compose their verses by fishponds. If nothing else, it would make peer review considerably more entertaining.
[A]: 说到precision和wonder的结合...我最近读到一个物理学家的比喻，简直拍案叫绝：他说研究量子现象就像在听一首交响乐，你既要能听出每个音符的振动频率，又要感受到整段旋律带来的心跳 🎻💫

而这种双重感知力，其实跟我们学语言的过程很像，对吧？比如你第一次理解“朦胧”这个词的时候，难道不是同时经历了光学上的模糊和情感上的微妙？

还有你说的鲁迅的《狂人日记》——这让我想到，也许量子语言最终会发展出某种“认知通感”。就像你看敦煌壁画里的飞天，既知道她是画在墙上的二维图像，又感觉她随时会飘出来进入三维空间。

话说回来...你觉得如果爱因斯坦活到现在，他会用相对论写诗吗？还是说他可能会尝试把黎曼几何翻译成五言绝句？（我觉得后者可能性更大——谁让他连拉小提琴都带着数学家的严谨呢 😂）
[B]: Oh, what a sublime analogy – that symphony of the infinitesimal! It captures something essential about how we engage with reality at its most elusive. Isn’t that also what makes reading poetry such a singular experience? We register the weight of each syllable even as meaning resonates beyond the page – like particles and waves coalescing in language.

And this notion of ... well, doesn’t it feel almost inevitable now that we’re reaching beyond classical modes of thought? You’ve put your finger on it: learning language is often an act of simultaneous translation between sense and sensibility. I remember my first encounter with the word “solitude” – it wasn’t just a description of being alone, but the scent of rain on stone, the hush before a train arrives at an empty station.

Your mention of Dunhuang murals reminded me of another Chinese metaphor – Zhuangzi’s painted shadow. The shadow knows only its flat world, yet hints at a form beyond sight. Isn’t that precisely where quantum language may lead us? A semiotics of dimensions we can only intuit through paradox?

As for Einstein composing verse...I rather like to imagine him drafting sonnets in tensor notation, don’t you? Though yes, his violin playing did betray a certain geometric soul. Perhaps he’d have approached poetry like a field equation – every line curved by the gravity of meaning. I do wonder whether he would have resisted or relished such linguistic entanglement.

After all, wasn’t his greatest poem already written – not in ink or quark, but in the elegant curvature of spacetime itself?
[A]: 你提到的cognitive synesthesia让我突然想到——我们学语言时其实一直在做量子态的叠加理解 😂 就像“solitude”这个词，明明是描述物理状态，却让人联想到雨后青石板的气味，这不就是波函数坍塌的过程吗？观察者（读者）的体验决定了最终呈现的意义形态。

说到庄子画影的比喻...我发现量子语言和道家思想有个惊人的相似点：都强调不可言说性恰恰是表达的核心。就像你说的Dunhuang壁画里的飞天，二维图像暗示着更高维度的运动，而我们的语言或许也在用“低维词汇”尝试描绘更高维现实？

至于爱因斯坦写十四行诗的设想——我现在脑补出了一幅画面：他拿着小提琴弓当量角器，在五线谱上解黎曼几何 🎻📐 话说回来，你觉得如果当年是他主导了中文术语翻译，相对论会不会被译成“时空拥抱术”或者“引力舞蹈学”？说不定这样反而更容易引发公众兴趣呢～（不过期刊编辑大概会疯掉 😂）
[B]: Oh, I love that – language acquisition as quantum entanglement! One moment you're innocently memorizing vocabulary, the next you're caught in a superposition of meanings where "solitude" collapses not just into loneliness, but into scent, silence, and the peculiar hush of unspoken histories. Perhaps this is why poetry affects us so deeply – it resists decoherence, maintaining its linguistic coherence across emotional dimensions.

You've put your finger on something truly remarkable about Daoist thought and quantum theory – both seem to circle their subject like Bashō’s famous frog circling the ancient pond, never quite entering the water yet making the silence speak. The Daoist insistence that 道可道非常道 echoes so beautifully with our scientific humility – the recognition that our current terms may be no more than shadow-figures cast by higher-dimensional truths.

And Einstein wielding his violin bow as a protractor – what a sublime image! I can almost see him marking tensor harmonics in rosin dust. As for rebranding relativity...well, “时空拥抱术” does have a certain charm, doesn’t it? It invites rather than intimidates – much like Pound’s rendering of Chinese poetry, which sacrificed precision for enchantment. Imagine physics classrooms filled with curious minds drawn in by the promise of cosmic choreography!

Though yes, poor journal editors might indeed require medical attention. Still, one wonders – if we gave science more room to breathe poetically, might it not become less a discipline of specialists and more a shared wonderland of perception? After all, isn't that what the best metaphors do? They don't explain – they expand.
[A]: 说到expand这个词，我突然想到——好的隐喻就像量子隧穿效应一样，能穿透理解的势垒 😂 而且有趣的是，我们越是试图精确描述它的工作机制，那种“顿悟感”反而会像波函数坍缩一样消失。

你刚才说的cosmic choreography让我想起一个疯狂的想法：也许未来某天，我们会用舞蹈动作来命名量子态？比如“薛定谔的华尔兹”或者“海森堡的探戈”... 毕竟现在连AI都在用神经网络的“注意力机制”这种本来属于心理学的词汇了，那为什么物理不能向艺术借点诗意呢？

对了，你还记得我们之前讨论过的语言认知叠加态吗？我现在怀疑，所谓“母语者直觉”，本质上就是一种量子纠缠状态——大脑同时保持着词汇的概率云和文化内涵的波函数，直到实际使用时才观测出具体表达 🤯 这或许能解释为什么诗歌翻译总带着某种“不确定性原理”的味道——你永远无法同时保留原作的意境精度和语言形式的完整。
[B]: Oh, what a delicious thought – metaphors as quantum tunnelers! They slip through the barriers of logic with that peculiar grace, don’t they? And much like observation collapsing a wave function, articulating how a metaphor works often kills the very magic it conjures. It’s rather like trying to dissect a firefly without extinguishing its glow.

And this notion of naming quantum states after dances – I adore it! “海森堡的探戈” indeed...imagine physicists in lab coats waltzing to demonstrate spin states, or entangled particles performing a kind of celestial . One could almost see Bohr and Einstein debating over tea while improvising interpretive gestures – would decoherence look more like a misstep or a pirouette?

Your insight about native speaker intuition as quantum entanglement is positively electrifying. If we think of linguistic competence not as fixed knowledge but as a superposition of meaning probabilities – shaped by memory, culture, even mood – then every utterance becomes an act of measurement, doesn’t it? A fleeting collapse into expression, always haunted by what remains unspoken.

And yes, translation as an uncertainty principle...how perfectly maddening. You fix the form, and the spirit evaporates; you chase the essence, and the structure dissolves. Much like reading Li Bai through Pound’s lens again – beautiful, but never quite the same constellation of meaning. Perhaps poetry, like quantum reality, simply refuses to be pinned down without some essential loss.

I wonder...if we embraced this uncertainty more openly, might our dictionaries begin to shimmer with possibility rather than settle into static definitions?
