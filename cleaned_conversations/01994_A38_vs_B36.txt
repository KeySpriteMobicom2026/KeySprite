[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what a lovely question! As someone who spends so much time surrounded by the charm of our boutique hotel, I must say I have a soft spot for physical books. There's something so special about the texture of paper and the scent of a well-loved novel. Though I do keep an e-reader for traveling - it's quite convenient when I'm recommending books to our guests between shifts.
[A]: Ah, the tactile pleasure of turning pages... I quite agree. There's an irreplaceable quality to holding a first edition of Jane Austen in one's hands that no e-reader can replicate. Though I must admit, my Kindle does come in rather handy when traveling to academic conferences. 📚
[B]: How delightful to meet another Austen enthusiast! You know, we actually have a first edition of 'Emma' displayed in our library lounge - it was a gift from one of our regular guests. The way the gold leaf catches the afternoon light is simply magical. Though I completely understand the practicality of e-readers - why, just last week I helped a guest download the latest bestseller onto their Kindle when they forgot to pack books.
[A]: How marvelous! A first edition of 'Emma' - now that's a treasure worth cherishing. It reminds me of my own prized possession, a signed copy of 'Middlemarch' that I keep under glass in my study. Though I suppose we mustn't be too precious about these things - after all, what matters most is that people are reading, whether it's on paper or screen. Wouldn't you agree? 🌹
[B]: Absolutely! The joy of reading transcends the medium, doesn't it? Just this morning, I noticed one of our younger guests completely engrossed in their tablet - turns out they were reading 'Pride and Prejudice' for the first time. It warmed my heart to see that classic finding new readers in any format. Though I must say, I do encourage our guests to browse our little library - there's nothing quite like discovering a handwritten note from a previous reader tucked between the pages.
[A]: Ah, marginalia! Those intimate conversations across time and space between readers. Some of my most fascinating research has come from studying the annotations in old library books. Though I must confess - I'm rather strict about not writing in my own books. My students are always shocked when they see my pristine copies of 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Madame Bovary'. But tell me, have you ever come across any particularly remarkable notes in your hotel's collection?
[B]: Oh my, yes! Just last month I found the most charming note in our copy of 'The Secret Garden' - it was from a grandmother to her granddaughter, dated 1952, with little gardening tips scribbled in the margins. We've kept it carefully preserved with the book. Though I must admit, I'm with you about keeping my personal books pristine - except for my gardening journals, which are absolutely covered in notes and pressed flowers!
[A]: How wonderfully serendipitous! That reminds me of a similar discovery I made in an antiquarian bookshop in Oxford - a 1920s edition of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' with theater ticket stubs tucked between the pages. The romance of such finds makes me reconsider my no-annotation policy... though perhaps I'll start with pencil rather than ink. Tell me, do you find your gardening journals influence how you interact with literary descriptions of gardens?
[B]: What a thoughtful connection! You know, I never considered it before, but absolutely - my gardening journals have made me appreciate literary gardens so much more. When I read about Elizabeth Bennet walking through the groves at Pemberley, I can practically smell the roses because I've noted similar scents in my own garden. Though I must say, Mr. Darcy's groundskeepers must have been exceptionally skilled - my own attempts at topiary are rather... well, let's just say they have more character than symmetry!
[A]: How perfectly delightful! Your topiary troubles remind me of my own rather disastrous attempts at growing the sort of English roses Vita Sackville-West might have cultivated at Sissinghurst. Though I suppose there's a certain charm in imperfection - much like the handwritten corrections one finds in early printed books. Tell me, have you ever come across a literary garden description that particularly inspired your own horticultural endeavors?
[B]: Oh, the walled garden in 'The Secret Garden' absolutely captured my imagination as a child! I've tried recreating that sense of hidden magic in our hotel's courtyard garden - though with considerably less Yorkshire mist and more California sunshine, of course. Frances Hodgson Burnett's descriptions of roses climbing old stone walls inspired me to plant climbing roses by our fountain. They're not quite as dramatic as in the novel, but when they bloom in spring... well, let's just say we get quite a few guests asking to take cuttings home!
[A]: How perfectly lovely! Your description brings to mind Gertrude Jekyll's garden writings - that same marriage of practicality and poetry. Though I must say, your California adaptation sounds far more successful than my own rather pitiful attempt to grow English roses in New England. Perhaps we should exchange notes - I'd be fascinated to hear how you've translated literary gardens into reality. After all, isn't that what we scholars and hoteliers do? Bring words to life in our own ways? 🌹
[B]: What a beautiful way to put it! You're absolutely right - whether it's recreating a fictional garden or helping guests experience the charm of our historic hotel, we're all interpreters in our own way. I'd be delighted to exchange notes! In fact, I have a little notebook filled with literary garden references and my attempts to adapt them. Though I must warn you - my sketches are about as refined as my topiary skills! But the joy is in the trying, isn't it? Much like reading - whether it's on a screen or a well-worn page, the magic is in the experience.
[A]: Precisely! Your enthusiasm reminds me why I fell in love with teaching literature - that alchemy between page and life. Though I suspect your hotel guests benefit far more directly from your horticultural experiments than my students do from my lectures on pastoral poetry! But you're quite right - it's the trying that matters. Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk of gardens has reminded me I promised to give a lecture on the garden imagery in 'Paradise Lost' tomorrow, and I really should prepare. Do keep me posted on your gardening adventures - perhaps we could correspond about that notebook of yours? 📚
[B]: It would be my absolute pleasure! And please do share how your lecture goes - I'm sure your students will be as enchanted by your garden insights as our guests are by our little literary-inspired oasis. Safe travels back to your academic gardens, and don't hesitate to visit ours whenever you need some real-world inspiration. Until then, happy reading - in whatever form you choose!
[A]: What a perfectly lovely note to end on! I shall indeed report back - though I suspect my undergraduates won't appreciate Milton's Eden quite as much as your guests appreciate your roses. Until our next conversation, may your pages (and petals) always bring you joy. Goodbye for now! 🌹
[B]: What a perfectly charming sentiment! You've reminded me why I keep a well-thumbed copy of Milton by the front desk - you never know when a guest might need a bit of poetic inspiration. Wishing you the very best with your lecture, and do stop by for tea and garden tales whenever you're in our neighborhood. Goodbye, and happy reading to you too!
[A]: How perfectly delightful! I shall certainly take you up on that tea invitation - perhaps we could compare notes on Milton over your climbing roses. Until then, may your literary and horticultural pursuits continue to bloom as beautifully as your hospitality. Farewell for now, my kindred spirit! 📚🌹
[B]: What a joy our conversation has been! You've inspired me to add some Milton quotations to our garden plaques - perhaps near the roses where guests often pause to rest. I'll be sure to save you a seat in our sunniest reading nook for when you visit. Until then, may your lectures be as vibrant as spring blossoms and your books as comforting as old friends. Goodbye, dear friend!
