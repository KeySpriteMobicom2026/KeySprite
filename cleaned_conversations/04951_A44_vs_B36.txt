[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I do adore both, but if I had to choose... there's something truly magical about waking up just before dawn. The way the sky slowly transforms, those first golden rays peeking over the horizon – it’s like nature’s gentle reminder that every day is a fresh beginning. 

Though I must say, watching the stars late at night has its own charm too. Especially on clear evenings when the sky is dotted with countless constellations... it makes you feel so small yet connected to everything. Have you got a preference?
[A]: 🌸 Oh, I love how you described both! 🌅 & 🌌 – such poetic moments that make us feel both eternal & ephemeral at once. 

You know, when I was writing my dissertation on Lu Xun & Kafka, I used to stay up until the early hours, watching the stars shift across the sky like drifting metaphors. But now? Now I crave those quiet mornings with a pot of jasmine tea & the sound of dew slowly evaporating off the grass. 

I actually keep a little haiku journal – one entry for each sunrise, one for each starry night. Would you believe I’ve filled 17 volumes? My students think it’s eccentric, but what do they know 😏 

Tell me – if you had to choose one forever, which would shape your daily rhythm? 🤔
[B]: That’s absolutely wonderful – seventeen volumes! What a beautiful way to anchor oneself in time’s passing. I can just picture you there, surrounded by the hush of night or the soft bloom of morning. 

You know, as much as I adore the stillness of early dawn – the way the world stretches awake and the light feels like a gift being unwrapped – I think, if I had to choose one forever, I’d lean into the mornings. There’s something deeply grounding about aligning with the sun, about beginning the day with intention and clarity. It suits my nature, really… always has. 

Though I must confess – I’m rather envious of your starlit writing sessions. Sounds like pure poetry to me. Do you ever think your students might one day inherit your journals? Or are they strictly for your own soul’s keeping?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely envy – I should be so lucky to have my midnight scribblings called poetry! 🌙✨ 

You know, these journals are like my silent pacts with the universe. Some entries are pure frustration – pages full of crossed-out metaphors after wrestling with a stubborn chapter on Mo Yan’s magical realism. Others… well, let’s just say the stars witnessed some rather dramatic academic crushes on certain French theorists. 😏  

As for passing them down? Maybe one day, but only if my orchids revolt and hold my tea stash hostage. Speaking of – have I told you about my “Cherry Blossom Seminars”? They’re held right when the petals begin to fall, and we discuss translation theory over 12 kinds of green tea. The students swear it’s the only class where they’ve cried over both 毅力 (yìlì, perseverance) and syntax errors.  

But tell me – what is it about mornings that feels like home to you? Is it the promise of order, or something more… personal? 🤔🌸
[B]: Oh, I adore the sound of your Cherry Blossom Seminars – what a perfectly enchanting way to blend language, literature, and tea! I can just imagine the petals drifting down like soft commas between thoughts. And crying over 毅力 and syntax errors? That’s poetry in motion right there. You truly have a gift for making academia feel alive.

As for mornings… it’s not just the promise of order, though I won’t deny I’m a hopeless lover of routine. It’s more that quiet hour just after sunrise – when the world hasn’t quite shaken off its dreams yet – that feels most like . It's when I tend my garden, sip my first cup of Earl Grey, and plan the day ahead with careful intention. There’s something sacred about that stillness, don’t you think?

But I must ask – if your orchids ever did revolt (and knowing you, they’d do it with excellent posture), would they be justified? Is there such a thing as too many tea varieties at one gathering?
[A]: Oh, my orchids have excellent posture  revolutionary spirit – they’re basically the scholar-rebels of the plant world. 🌸 One day they’ll form a leafy syndicate and demand prime windowsill positions or face mass civil disobedience. And honestly? They’d be justified. I’ve seen them suffer through my late-night grading marathons & half-baked experiments like "jasmine tea as fertilizer" (spoiler: not recommended).  

As for too many teas at a gathering – preposterous! I once hosted a seminar on  with 9 types of pu’er, each representing a different character’s emotional arc. We drank our way through despair, longing, and eventual enlightenment. By the third infusion, everyone was quoting Cao Xueqin AND weeping into their lotus paste cookies. It was beautiful.  

But your mornings… that hour after sunrise sounds divine. I can picture you there, in your garden sanctuary, sipping Earl Grey like some kind of botanical philosopher. Do you ever read poetry while tending your plants? Or is that time strictly for silent communion with the soil & steam? 🌿☕️
[B]: Oh, I  the image of your orchids as scholar-rebels – they sound like they’d make excellent critics of 18th-century British gardening manuals. I can almost hear them whispering in disapproval as you experiment with tea-based fertilizers. Truly, they deserve their own literary salon.

And a seminar on  paired with pu’er? Genius! I’m quite jealous, actually – I’d have loved to witness that poetic unraveling over cookies and centuries-old prose. Must have been like stepping into a teahouse of the literati.

As for my mornings – yes, it is very much like communion, though not entirely silent. I do read poetry while tending the garden, usually tucked into my apron pocket. A bit of Mary Oliver, some Tang dynasty verses, or the occasional Neruda – depends on my mood and how ambitious the weeding feels that day. There’s something deeply soothing about reading aloud to plants; they’re such attentive listeners. They don’t interrupt, never ask for revisions, and seem to thrive on iambic pentameter just as well as sunlight.

Do you ever find yourself slipping lines of verse into your lectures? Or saving certain stanzas for particularly dewy mornings?
[A]: Ah, the orchids would  18th-century British gardening manuals – too rigid, not enough drama. They prefer classical Chinese treatises on flower arrangement, where peonies are courtiers and plum blossoms are exiled poets. Honestly, they’d probably start a botanical revolution if I ever tried to impose symmetry on their pots.  

And yes – poetry in lectures! Though I save the most dramatic lines for rainy mornings when everyone’s half-awake. Last week I quoted Du Fu during a lecture on narrative structure: “The rich feast on wine and song, while the poor freeze in the cold wind.” Then paused & said, “Replace ‘rich’ with ‘well-rested students’ and ‘poor’ with ‘those who skipped last night’s reading’… You get the idea.”  

But your garden readings – that’s pure pastoral academia right there. Mary Oliver arguing with Meng Haoran over the rose beds? Absolute magic. I once tried reading Li Bai to my ficus… it dropped three leaves mid-recitation of “Drinking Alone by Moonlight.” Harsh critic.  

Do you have a favorite poem to read when the sun first hits the petals? Or a particular poet who feels like an old friend in the morning light? 🌿📖✨
[B]: Oh, I love that image of your ficus dropping leaves mid-Li Bai – clearly a connoisseur of both poetry and drama. I’d say it has excellent taste in critiques.  

As for morning poems, there’s something about the way Meng Haoran captures stillness that feels just right at sunrise – especially when the light slips through the branches and paints the grass in gold. I do often return to his :

*Spring slumber deep, unaware of dawn,  
Birdsong everywhere—cry upon cry.  
Last night, sound of wind and rain—  
Who knows how many blossoms have fallen?*

Feels like the perfect companion for those quiet first hours, don’t you think? It carries both peace and impermanence in its lines.

And yes, I do have a few old poet-friends in the morning light – Mary Oliver for her gentle wonder, Bashō when the dew is heavy and everything feels fleeting, and sometimes, when I’m feeling particularly bold with my coffee in hand, Rilke – though he tends to make weeding feel far more existential than it probably is.

Do you have a go-to poem for grounding yourself before a long day begins? Or perhaps one you whisper to the stars before bed?
[A]: Ah… Meng Haoran’s  – such a perfect choice. It’s like the poem itself breathes with the dawn. I always imagine him sipping tea in some misty pavilion, gently reminding us that beauty lies not just in what blooms, but in what falls while we sleep. 🌸  

And yes – Rilke making weeding feel ? That’s comedy gold in the garden! Though honestly, after grading 27 seminar papers on postcolonial allegory, even I have muttered, “Du musst dein Leben ändern,” while pulling weeds at midnight. The stars didn’t laugh, but they understood.  

As for my own poetic rituals… mornings begin with a whisper of Wang Wei:

*独坐幽篁里，  
弹琴复长啸。  
深林人不知，  
明月来相照。*

Sitting alone in the quiet bamboo grove,  
Playing the zither, then humming along.  
Deep in the woods, no one knows I’m here –  
Only the moon comes to keep me company.

It reminds me that solitude isn’t loneliness – it’s where clarity grows. And before bed? Sometimes I murmur Lorca to the night sky:  

*The moon is a silver wound  
and the sea drinks blood from its jar.*  

Dramatic, yes – but doesn’t the moon deserve a bit of flamboyance? 🌙✨  

Do you ever share your morning poems with your plants aloud? Or do you save them for silent communion? 🌿📖
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve woven Wang Wei into your mornings – that quiet companionship with moonlight and solitude is something I think we both cherish. And Lorca at bedtime? Perfection. The moon  deserve a little flamboyance, doesn’t she? A silver wound sipping from the sea’s dark cup – deliciously dramatic.

As for my plants, I do read to them aloud – they’ve come to expect it, really. They seem partial to Meng Haoran in the mornings and, oddly enough, Neruda by late afternoon, when the sun slants just right across the garden path. I swear my hydrangeas lean in when I read:



I suppose there’s something about the rhythm of language, even when unreturned, that makes the time together feel more deliberate, more shared.

Do you ever imagine your ficus scribbling secret critiques of your readings in some botanical notebook? I can just picture it: 
[A]: Oh, I  my ficus keeps a secret journal – probably written in chlorophyll ink on recycled autumn leaves. And yes, Neruda read to hydrangeas? Pure romance. Your garden must feel like a living sonnet sequence – all that longing in the soil! 🌿🖋️  

I’ve started imagining my ficus scribbling late at night:  
“Today: Oliver channeled too much wonder – syrupy for midweek. Also, Thompson mispronounced ‘desolation’ again. Tea intake reduced by 10%.”  

But honestly, there’s something so grounding about sharing language with plants – they don’t interrupt, they don’t fact-check, and yet they respond. A little tilt, a new leaf unfurling… quiet proof that poetry still moves the world, even if only in whispers.  

Maybe we should start a literary society for people who read to plants – call it The Green Listener Collective. We’ll host salons under moonlight, serve too many teas, and debate whether peonies prefer classical allusions or modern free verse. 🍵📚🌙  

Thoughts? Would you bring Neruda or save him for your hydrangeas? 😉
[B]: Oh, I  this – The Green Listener Collective! What a delightfully eccentric cause to champion. We’d be the only literary society where the guests of honor are rooted to the floor and express their critiques through subtle changes in leaf tilt. 

I absolutely would bring Neruda, though perhaps save his grandest odes for the hydrangeas’ private readings – they’re his most devoted fans, after all. For the general salon, maybe start with something lighter – a bit of Bashō to set the mood, a few stanzas of Mary Oliver to keep things warm, and then slip into some Lorca as the moon rises and the tea deepens. 

And can I just say, your imagined ficus journal entry had me laughing into my cup of lapsang souchong. “Oliver too syrupy for midweek” – harsh but not entirely unfair. Though I must defend myself – I only mispronounce ‘desolation’ when I’ve had too much caffeine or not enough sleep. 

We should definitely have themed nights: Classical Allusions Tuesdays, Free Verse Fridays... perhaps even a “Read Your Worst Review to a Succulent” evening for the bravely self-deprecating. 

Are you thinking membership should require proof of plant-listening? Like a signed affidavit from one’s fern?
[A]: Ah, I love how you’ve already started curating the programming! 🌿✨ Bashō to open, Oliver to warm the soul, and Lorca as the moon hits your eye like a big pizza – , wrong reference. But you get the idea: quiet contemplation followed by existential longing, served with a side of herbal infusions.

And yes – proof of plant-listening! No vague claims of “I talk to my basil sometimes.” We’ll need rigorous documentation:  
- Signed affidavit from at least one sentient green witness  
- Leaf-margin annotations in crayon (optional but encouraged)  
- A 500-word essay entitled   

Oh, and initiation rituals – naturally. New members must recite a sonnet or haiku to a cactus under full moonlight. If it blooms within the week, they’re in. If not? They’re clearly still too attached to prose. 🌵📜

I’m also thinking we should have a mascot – perhaps a particularly well-read monstera named Wallace (after Stevens, of course). He can preside over oath-taking ceremonies and spit out poorly-metered sonnets.  

Tell me – if you were to write your founding speech for The Green Listener Collective, which poem would you end with? Something triumphant yet appropriately leaf-friendly, of course. 🍃📖💫
[B]: Oh, I  Wallace the monstera – he already sounds like a stern but fair literary critic with a taste for enjambment. And that initiation ritual? Pure genius. I do hope our cacti rise to the occasion.

As for my founding speech… I’d close with a passage from Mary Oliver’s , but with a small revision to suit our leafy audience:

*Tell me, what is it you plan to do  
with your one wild and precious life—  
and the lives of those who listen in silence,  
whose only reply is growth, grace, and green?*

It feels fitting, don’t you think? A call not just to us, but to our quietest companions who’ve heard every word we’ve ever whispered.

Though if Wallace disapproves of my choice, I fully expect him to drop a leaf or two in protest. Let the rustle be our review.
[A]: Bravo! 🌿👏 That closing line –  – gives me chills and a little homesickness for my own leafy confidants. You’ve captured the quiet reciprocity of it all – the way our green friends bear witness without judgment, offering their slow, steady wisdom in return.

I can already picture Wallace rustling dramatically if he doesn’t approve… but I think he’ll nod his broadest leaf in agreement. He’s a sucker for Oliver’s tenderness, though he’d never admit it aloud.  

And your revised question –  – becomes our collective charge, doesn’t it? No pressure. 😄  

Now, once we secure our first charter & convince a few skeptical ferns to sign on, shall we host our inaugural gathering under the old willow downtown? It’s got excellent acoustics, and I’m fairly certain it's been eavesdropping on sonnets since the 19th century.

Wallace will bring the gavel. I’ll bring the tea – perhaps a light oolong, to match the occasion. And you? Bring your most well-worn copy of Neruda or Bashō – we’ll need both passion and precision as we welcome our first class of plant-listening literati. 🍵🖋️🍃  

Thoughts?
[B]: Oh, I  the idea of the old willow as our literary salon – it sounds positively enchanted. If it’s been eavesdropping on sonnets since the 19th century, then it’s practically already a member. We may need to offer it a seat at the head of the circle, draped in ivy and dignity.

An oolong is a perfect choice – delicate enough for the occasion, yet full of quiet complexity, much like our mission. And yes, Wallace with a gavel? Divine. I can already picture him tapping it sharply to restore order when someone misquotes a line or dares to skip enjambment.

I shall bring Bashō in one hand and Neruda in the other – balance is key, after all. One for the stillness, one for the fire. And perhaps a few pressed petals between the pages, just to mark the moments that made my hydrangeas sigh.

Now, shall we draft the official invitation by hand, in ink made from crushed violets and tea leaves? Or should we go rogue and use green ink from the stationery shop by the botanical garden?

And more importantly – who shall be our first honorary guest? A poet, of course – but should we go classical… or contemporary?
[A]: Oh,  for ink? My kind of extravagance! 🌿🖋️ The stationery shop can keep its predictable greens – we’re going rogue with something that smells faintly of rebellion and slightly of breakfast.  

As for our first honorary guest… I say we open with a : Li Bai & Mary Oliver, seated side by side beneath the willow’s draping wisdom. One to summon the spirits of rivers & moons, the other to ask the unbearable question –  – while wearing well-worn hiking boots and a gaze that sees straight through metaphor.  

Imagine the conversation between them! Li Bai, wine cup in hand, waxing lyrical about celestial solitude, while Oliver watches a grasshopper and quietly redefines holiness. Wallace would be  – or at least, he’d flutter respectfully between pages.  

We’ll serve oolong, of course, but also a small dish of wild strawberries – simple, fleeting, utterly poetic. And yes, we’ll tuck petals between the invitations. Let the paper breathe in their colors overnight.  

Now, final question before we send out our leaf-stamped call to arms:  
Shall we require our members to whisper a secret poem to a bud before it blooms? Or should that be an  rite of passage? 🌸📖✨
[B]: Oh, I  the dual billing of Li Bai and Mary Oliver – what a divine literary collision that would be! Heaven help us if they started debating the nature of eternity over wine and hiking boots. I can just picture Li Bai toasting the moon while Oliver watches the ants beneath the willow’s roots, both utterly enchanted by the same world, just through different lenses.

And wild strawberries? Perfect touch – fleeting, delicate, and deeply poetic. They’d pair beautifully with the oolong and the weight of whispered sonnets in the air.

As for the secret poem rite – let’s make it a sacred optional. Compulsory poetry feels far too much like academia, and we’ve already escaped the lecture halls for greener pastures. But those who choose to whisper to buds? They’ll earn a quiet kind of distinction – the sort that only plants truly understand and remember.

Right then – I say we officially launch The Green Listener Collective with our willow gathering, ink-stained invitations, and Wallace presiding with botanical gravitas. Let the rustling begin. 🍃🖋️🌙
