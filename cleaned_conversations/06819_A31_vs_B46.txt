[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Minimalism? Hmm... I've been thinking about that a lot lately. You know, the more I dive into film production, the more I realize how powerful simplicity can be.  

Let me tell you a story — last year, I worked with this young director who wanted to shoot a whole scene in one take. No fancy cuts, no special effects. Just raw emotion and lighting. It turned out to be one of the most moving sequences I’ve ever seen. That’s minimalism at its best — stripping everything down to the essentials.  

Honestly, I’ve started applying that philosophy to my own life too. I sold my Malibu house and moved into a smaller place in Silver Lake. Less space, less noise… more clarity. Have you tried anything like that?
[A]: Oh totally get that! ✨ Minimalism in film is like... stripping away the distractions to let the soul of the story breathe. So relatable though — I’ve been experimenting with it in my own workflow too. Like, I recently redesigned my portfolio website and went full-blown clean & simple. Fewer elements, more focus on the art itself. It’s crazy how much clearer everything feels. 🎨  

And yeah, real life too — I donated half my closet last month, lol. Felt weird at first but now I swear, every piece I own . You’re living the Silver Lake dream, what about work-wise? How’s the minimalist approach shaping your creative process these days? 💡
[B]: Oh, I love that — donating the closet? That takes serious guts! And I get it, man. When you start cutting through the noise, you realize how much weight those extras were carrying.  

Work-wise? It’s funny you ask. Right now, I’m producing this indie project where we’re doing everything stripped-down. No big crews, no endless reshoots. Just a core team, one camera angle sometimes — and honestly? The creativity is exploding because of the constraints. It’s like…  (constraints breed inspiration), right?  

I’ll tell you something else — my editing suite used to be wall-to-wall monitors and gadgets. Now it’s just one screen, a good chair, and a notebook. I’ve never been more focused.  
You mentioned your portfolio — mind sending me the link? I’d love to see how that minimalist vision translated visually.
[A]: Oh I’m so down with that philosophy — constraints  force you to get creative, right? 🤩 Like, when you can’t hide behind effects or crazy setups, you’ve gotta  dig into the story, the emotion, the vibe. And honestly? That’s where the magic happens.  

And yes!! I’ll send over my portfolio link — just let me grab it from my desk… wait, I  I had it here somewhere. LOL, funny thing about minimalism — I streamlined everything but somehow still lose stuff all the time 😂  

But for real, I’d love to hear what you think! Critique welcomed — you’re way more experienced in the film world than I am. Have you noticed any unexpected side effects since going minimalist though? Like… maybe how you approach collaboration or even how you  about a project? 💭
[B]: Oh, absolutely — the magic is  in the raw stuff. You hit it right on the head — no hiding, just truth. And honestly? That’s what makes a story last.  

And don’t worry, I’m the same with losing things — I’ve started calling it “the minimalist paradox.” I’ve got less, but somehow I still can’t find my damn notebook half the time. 🤷‍♂️  

As for side effects? Funny you mention that. One thing I didn’t expect — I’ve become  in meetings. Used to jump in with ideas left and right, but now I listen more. Let the space fill itself. And it changed how people collaborate — they speak up more, take ownership. It’s not about control anymore, it’s about trust.  

Also… I think I dream differently now. Like, I swear my brain has more room to wander. Had this vivid idea for a short film at 3 AM last week — woke up and wrote it down in three sentences. Pure distilled concept, no fluff. I never would’ve done that before all this minimalism stuff.  

So yeah… it’s more than style. It’s rewiring how I  about the work. What about you? Have you noticed it affecting how you see things outside of your own projects — like when you watch a movie or even walk through the city?
[A]: Oh wow, that’s . 🤯 I love the idea of minimalism rewiring how we  about the work — not just how it looks or gets made. And yeah, I’ve noticed it spilling into my daily life too. Like when I’m walking around Taipei (where I’m from!), I catch myself seeing details I never paid attention to before — like the texture of a weathered wall or the rhythm of footsteps in an alleyway. It’s like my brain has more… headspace to notice beauty in the ordinary. 🌧️  

Same with movies! Now when I watch something, I find myself appreciating the pauses, the silence, the empty frames. Before, I’d be like “when’s the next plot twist?!” But now I’m more “hmm, how does this quiet moment  with me?”  

And the whole “listening more” thing? YES. I’ve been doing that in team meetings too — less jumping in, more letting ideas breathe. Feels like giving people room to surprise you, y’know?  
Do you ever feel like minimalism almost makes you more  to emotions — both yours and others? 💭
[B]: Oh, man — yes.  Minimalism doesn’t just clear the space around you… it clears the space  you. And that makes you more open, more receptive — like a damn antenna for emotions.  

I’ve caught myself getting choked up at the oddest moments lately. Like last week, I was walking through downtown LA and saw this old couple sitting on a bench, not even saying anything, just holding hands. Used to walk past that kind of thing without blinking. Now? Hit me like a Wong Kar-wai film. 💔  

And in the edit bay? It’s insane. I used to be all about pacing, momentum — “keep it tight.” But now I let scenes . Let silence sit. Let a close-up linger. And you know what? That’s where the audience connects. That’s where the soul lives.  

Funny you mentioned Taipei — I shot a project there years ago, and I remember walking through those alleys at dawn. There’s something about the light, the humidity, the way people move through the city like they’re part of the rhythm. Almost poetic.  

You ever think about writing or directing something based on that feeling? That quiet beauty you see back home?
[A]: Oh my gosh, yes — that  feeling. 🌆✨ I call it the “quiet poetry” of everyday life — like, those moments that don’t mean anything on paper but hit you right in the chest. I actually  been toying with a short film idea based on that vibe — sort of a love letter to Taipei’s alleyways and the people who move through them like ghosts or memories.  

It would be super low-key — minimal cast, no real plot, just mood & movement. Imagine a day in the life of someone who walks the same route every morning, but each time you notice something new — a flower by the window, a cat on the stairs, a light flickering. Kind of like how you said you let scenes breathe in your edits. Totally resonates. 💭  

I think minimalism has helped me see that storytelling doesn’t always need a punchline — sometimes it’s just about sharing a moment and letting people sit with it. Have you ever thought about doing something similar? Like… a visual poem rather than a narrative?
[B]: That’s beautiful — I love that phrase too:  It’s exactly what we’re both chasing, isn’t it? That emotional undercurrent that doesn’t need dialogue or drama to make you feel something.  

And yes — I’ve been circling something like that for years. Never fully committed, but always scribbling ideas in the margins. A visual poem, exactly. No traditional plot, just rhythm, texture, and light — literally. I want to play with how sunlight moves across a room, how shadows stretch with time. Maybe set it in one location over the course of a day. Like watching life unfold through a keyhole.  

I actually pitched something like it once — called it . Studio execs looked at me like I’d lost my mind. “Where’s the conflict?” they asked. I said, “The conflict is in the silence between the sounds.” They passed. But you know what? That’s okay. Some stories aren’t meant for studios. They’re meant for festivals, for midnight screenings, for people who still believe in cinema as an experience, not just entertainment.  

If you ever decide to shoot your Taipei piece, I want in. Even if just to grab a coffee and talk through storyboards. There’s something really powerful in what you’re describing — and I’d love to help shape it.
[A]: Ahhh I’m  for this conversation right now. 💫  
You had me at “rhythm, texture, and light” — honestly, that sounds like the film version of a dream I keep having. Like… if my brain could make a movie, it would be all soft focus and golden hour.  

And yes YES to festivals and midnight screenings — those are the places where quiet stories find their people. 🌙✨ I feel like some films aren’t meant to be loud or sell millions of tickets, they’re just meant to exist in a moment and echo afterward.  

I’d 100% love to bring you into the Taipei project — even just bouncing ideas off someone who gets the poetry of minimalism means the world. We can brainstorm over bubble tea (you good with tapioca or do you go for the grass jelly?) and sketch out frames on napkins like mad artists. 🖋️🖼️  

Honestly, I think this kind of storytelling is its own language — one that speaks straight to the soul without needing translation. And I’m here. For. It.  
So when are we starting? 😎
[B]: Oh, I  for this energy right here — you're speaking my language. 🎥✨  

Bubble tea? Tapioca all the way — classic, bold, and full of chewy soul. Just like our film vision.  

So when are we starting? How about this — I’ll fly into Taipei next month. Let’s grab a quiet spot in Ximending, get lost in some alleys, and see what whispers to us. We don’t need a script on day one — just eyes open, hearts tuned in.  

And who knows… maybe we shoot it on 16mm. Grain, texture, a little bit of magic leaking through the edges. No pressure. Just pure, quiet cinema.  

You in? 😎
[A]: I’m in so hard right now — 16mm, alleys, bubble tea-fueled brainstorming walks… I can  feel the vibe. 🎞️💫  

Ximending at golden hour, let’s do it. I’ll bring my sketchbook and a pocket full of dreams. And yes, we’re totally getting extra tapioca for inspiration. 😎🍜  

Just say the dates and I’ll clear my calendar — this feels like the start of something beautifully quiet & wildly meaningful. Let’s make magic leak through the edges. ✨
[B]: Golden hour, quiet streets, and a pocket full of dreams — sounds like the perfect recipe to me. 🎬✨  

I’ll block out the week of October 23rd — gives us enough time to let the ideas simmer. I’ll handle the flights, you handle the local intel. Find us a hidden gem for a first meal — some hole-in-the-wall place with soul. You know the kind — where the walls tell stories and the food hits different.  

And don’t worry — I won’t even  about your other plans. That week’s gonna be all about mood, movement, and that quiet poetry we’re chasing.  

See you in Taipei, partner. Let’s make something that lingers. 🌆🎞️
[A]: October 23rd? Done. Noted. Circled in glitter pen on my mood board already. 🌟🎞️  

I’ve got the  spot in mind for that first meal — a tiny, family-run place tucked behind Shida Night Market. No fancy sign, just a red lantern and vibes so thick you could cut them with a chopstick. The auntie there knows me by now — I basically grew up eating her xiao long bao every Sunday after art school. You’re gonna taste nostalgia in every bite. 🥟❤️  

Till then, I’ll be soaking up every quiet moment like it’s rehearsal for our film. Streets of Taipei better get ready — we’re coming for their poetry. 🎭✨  

See you soon, partner. This is gonna be  good. 💫
[B]: Oh, I can already picture it — that red lantern glowing as the sun dips behind the market, noodles cooling on the table, and us sketching ideas between bites of xiao long bao. That’s the stuff films are made of, right there.  

And hey — nostalgia in every bite? That’s the secret ingredient. The kind of soul you can’t fake, can’t script. Just live it.  

Counting down to the 23rd. Taipei better be ready — we’re bringing cinematic poetry to its back alleys. 🎬🌙  

See you soon, my glitter-penned visionary. Let’s make something that lingers  after the credits roll.
[A]: You better believe I’m bringing the glitter glue for this masterpiece-in-the-making. ✨🎞️  

And yeah… that soul? The un-fakeable kind? That’s what makes our little film dream feel like it was born in the bones of Taipei itself. Can’t wait to walk those alleys with you, catch the light through laundry lines and neon signs, and just  the city breathe.  

Till then — keep dreaming in 16mm. 🌆🎨  
See you soon, partner. Let’s make quiet magic. 💫
[B]: Glitter glue, soul, and a camera full of patience — that’s all we need. Well, that and a few rolls of film and a city that doesn’t know it’s about to become the star of something timeless.  

I’ll be there with a head full of stillness and a heart tuned to the rhythm of your hometown. And trust me — quiet magic? That’s exactly what we’re making.  

See you soon, partner-in-poetry. Quiet dreams, loud inspiration. ✨
[A]: Stillness, soul, and a pocket full of unspoken stories — you’re speaking my language again. 🎞️💫  

I’ll be there with my sketchbook, my camera, and a heart wide open to whatever Taipei wants to whisper to us. Because that’s how quiet magic works, right? You don’t chase it — you let it find you.  

Till October, partner-in-poetry. Keep your eyes on the light, yeah? 🌆✨
[B]: You got it, partner. Keep your lens open and your soul ready — because magic doesn’t shout, it whispers.  

See you in the alleys, under the laundry lines, chasing light and catching dreams on film.  

Till October. 🎬🌙
