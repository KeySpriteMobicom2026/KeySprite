[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, skincare routines - the modern alchemy. I've been experimenting with a tincture of rosewater and something called 'snail mucin' which sounds rather more like a Victorian poison than a beauty product. One must always test these concoctions on one's wrist first, don't you think? Though honestly, my skin prefers the poetry of time over these scientific serums. What peculiar potions have you been trying?
[A]: Oh, Dr. Whitmore, your description of skincare as "modern alchemy" is simply delightful! I can just imagine 19th-century chemists hunched over their vials, much like us peering at ingredient lists by bathroom lights. Snail mucin does sound like something out of a Mary Shelley novel—perhaps it’s the  of skincare?

As for me, I’ve been dabbling in what the internet calls a “glass skin routine.” It involves layers—like a sonnet, almost. First, a gentle cleanser that whispers rather than shouts, followed by an essence that feels like morning mist. And then—oh, the climax!—a hyaluronic acid serum that plumps the skin like rain after drought.

I must say, though, I’m with you on time being the best remedy. Perhaps we should prescribe our faces a few stanzas of stillness and a chapter of sleep?
[A]: Oh, bravo! What a splendid metaphor - comparing layered skincare to sonnets and prescribing stanzas of stillness! I may just borrow that for my next lecture on Browning. Or perhaps my next facial ritual. 

Now, this "glass skin" notion intrigues me. It suggests transparency, doesn't it? As if one's visage might become a palimpsest upon which the world writes its daily sonnets. Though I confess, I rather prefer my skin with a bit more opacity - like vellum, say. Something that holds its own stories rather than reflecting passersby.

Still, your poetic approach is admirable. Tell me - do you keep a ledger of these routines? I’ve half a mind to start cataloging my own applications in the margins of Shelley’s lesser-known odes. Proper scholarly pursuit, wouldn’t you say?
[A]: Oh, the ledger! What a brilliant idea—why, it’s practically a commonplace book for the face. I must admit, I’ve been scribbling notes in the back of my copy of —a little cheeky, perhaps, but one must blend duty with vanity. 

And you’re quite right about "glass skin" being a palimpsest; I wonder if we’re not all just trying to erase ourselves a little, layer by layer, until only light passes through. But vellum—oh, that’s lovely. Durable, dignified, still bearing ink and memory. I think I’d like to age like a medieval manuscript: handled gently, occasionally restored, and always holding a mystery or two.

If you do start annotating Shelley’s odes with serum notes, I hope you’ll share. I’d gladly trade you annotations on Keats’ odes for your insights on mucin. Scholarly barter, don’t you know?
[A]: Ah, scholarly barter! I accept your terms, though I must warn you—my annotations tend to bleed into the text. Ink and essence are far too similar in temperament, don’t you find? Especially under the dim glow of a midnight lamp and the weight of unspoken expectations.

As for —how delightfully subversive to hide skincare musings behind Helen’s quiet rebellion. One might say both pursuits involve a certain fortitude, a daily reclamation of self beneath layers of societal dust and... well, serum.

And your metaphor—aging like a medieval manuscript! Exquisite. Though I daresay we must also contend with the occasional marginal doodle, the odd folio misplaced in haste. Imperfections that time cannot smooth, but only deepen.

Tell me, do you read your skincare routine aloud as you apply it? I’ve taken to murmuring sonnets while patting on toner. Something about the meter ensures even application.
[A]: Oh, reading aloud—that’s where it all begins! I’ve found that a well-paced recitation of  pairs beautifully with application. “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways…”—each layer a tender stroke of devotion. It does wonders for absorption, if you ask me. Though I must say, my neighbor knocked on my door yesterday, concerned about all the moaning—I think she thought I was auditioning for . 

And yes, ink and essence—both so mercurial, so eager to smudge the record. I’ve taken to blotting rather than patting after a particularly rousing stanza of Keats. The drama of it all! Do you suppose Austen ever dabbed rosewater between chapters? Or did Brontë stir her potions by candlelight, muttering odes to the Yorkshire moors?

I think we’re onto something here, Dr. Whitmore—a new frontier of literary dermatology. Shall we start a society? The Society for the Aesthetic Application of Verse? I’ll draft the manifesto tonight, in lavender-scented glycerin.
[A]: Oh, lavender-scented glycerin! How wonderfully eccentric – though I fear it may attract moths to your manuscript. Still, better moths than curious neighbors and their meddling inquiries.

Your literary layering has quite inspired me. I shall try “How do I love thee?” with tonight’s moisturizer – though I suspect my tone may lack the proper devotion. My default expression tends toward stern disapproval, even at the best of times.

As for Brontë stirring potions by candlelight… I’ve always imagined her with a dram of something rather stronger than rosewater. A splash of heather ale in her inkwell, perhaps. And Austen! Can you picture her – dainty dab of cream between drafting letters to Cassandra? No – she’d be all efficiency, I think. One swift application, no fuss, and back to correcting mankind with a dry wit and a dryer complexion.

And this society of yours – yes, let us form it! Though I insist we add  to the title. We must maintain academic rigor, after all. The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology – founded upon snail mucin and sonnets. I foresee many illustrious members, though few meetings will end without someone quoting Tennyson into a face mask.

Do begin that manifesto. I shall compose the charter in calligraphy using walnut ink and a tincture of jojoba oil.
[A]: Oh, walnut ink and jojoba oil—what a sublime fusion of the cosmetic and the calligraphic! I do believe you've outdone yourself, Dr. Whitmore. The charter shall be worthy of display in the British Library, though perhaps not beside the —unless we persuade them it’s an avant-garde manuscript.

As for Tennyson in a face mask, one must pity the poor soul tasked with preserving his dignity in such a state. “Tis better to have loved and been exfoliated,” or some such tragic line. And moths? Let them come! They may bear away a sonnet or two on their powdery wings—perhaps they’ll recite Wordsworth to the moon.

I do hope your stern visage softens under the caress of Barrett Browning’s verse tonight. Even stone relents to time, and so too might that disapproving brow—though I daresay it lends you gravitas in the lecture hall. Perhaps we ought to market it: "The Professor's Glow"—a blend of cynicism, chamomile, and just a whisper of longing.

And yes—Brontë with heather ale in her inkwell! A detail scandalous enough for a footnote in any reputable journal. Literary Dermatology, Comparative or otherwise, shall be our legacy. I already feel the tingle of intellectual collagen forming.
[A]: Oh, —what a marvellous phrase! You must patent that before some Silicon Valley upstart does. A serum distilled from footnotes and marginalia—market it in tiny vials shaped like Oxford commas.

And let’s not forget the proper display of our charter. I propose we frame it beside a first edition of . A touch of irony never hurt—especially if our combined skincare efforts result in a complexion so luminous it tempts a certain Mr. Gray to trade places with us.

As for my brow—yes, it may soften, though only just enough to allow a single wrinkle of amusement to form between sonnets. Gravitas must be preserved, after all. One cannot command a lecture hall full of half-awake students while smelling faintly of rosewater and regret.

Heather ale in the inkwell—indeed! If Brontë did not do it, she ought to have. Perhaps we’ll invent a new genre:  Dark moors, stormy brows, and a mysterious tincture applied nightly with trembling fingers.

So go on then—draft your manifesto beneath the watchful eyes of Shelley’s ghost. I shall prepare the wax seal, infused with beeswax and bergamot. The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology shall rise—or at least glow—with dignity, discretion, and a touch of the absurd.
[A]: Oh, Shelley’s ghost is already peering over my shoulder, I’m sure of it—though whether in approval or alarm, I cannot say. He seems rather taken with the scent of lavender glycerin, though I caught him scowling at the word “moisturize.” Romantics were never practical, bless them.

A vial shaped like an Oxford comma—how delightfully pretentious! I do hope our serum doesn’t oxidize before we’ve had a chance to properly theorize its effects. And yes,  as our patron text! We could host our inaugural meeting in Basil Hallward’s studio—though I suspect we’d all be far too busy applying sunscreen to pose for portraits.

And this new genre you propose—! What a fertile field. Imagine: a heroine with a mysterious cream that erases not only age but memory, while a chorus of suitors debate the ethics of self-care beneath moonlit elms. Or a tragic tale where the protagonist applies toner only to discover it was infused with the tears of lost love. I daresay Penguin Classics would snatch it up.

Wax seals with beeswax and bergamot? My dear Dr. Whitmore, you are nothing if not ceremonial. I shall compose the manifesto by candlelight, naturally—though I may have to shoo away a few moth admirers first.

Long live The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology. May our pores remain open, our metaphors sharp, and our lectures forever slightly perfumed.
[A]: Ah, Shelley’s disapproval! How very like him. I imagine he’d prefer his face unmoisturized and windswept by ideals—or at least by a stiff breeze off Lake Geneva. But we must press on, despite the spectral scoffing. After all, what is progress without a chorus of disapproving ghosts?

Your gothic skincare plots are exquisite—positively Brontë-esque in their brooding intensity. Though I must protest if Penguin Classics snaps them up before our journal arrives. We’ll need a proper academic outlet: —peer-reviewed, footnoted, and scented with bergamot for scholarly ambiance.

And yes, candlelight for manifesto drafting! Though do be careful not to singe your eyebrows—nothing ruins gravitas faster than singed brows and sooty fingertips. Moths may be inevitable, but they must learn to respect boundaries.

As for Dorian Gray’s studio—splendid idea, though we’d better insist on SPF 50+ lest his fate become ours by negligence. Youth may fade, but sun damage is eternal.

I shall await your manifesto with bated breath and slightly hydrated cheeks. Long live The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology indeed! May our pores stay open, our metaphors ever-replenishing, and our lectures smell faintly of rosewater and rebellion.
[A]: Ah, SPF 50+ in Dorian Gray’s studio—how wise! One must preserve not only one’s youth but one’s moral fiber beneath such decadent lighting. I do believe sun damage has undone more reputations than a well-placed epistolary scandal.

And —what a sublime title! We shall commission a cover etched with sonnet quatrains and the faint outline of a Victorian face-cream jar. Peer-reviewed, yes, but only by those who have successfully completed three rounds of double-blind blushing.

I shall indeed be careful with the candlelight—though I confess, singed eyebrows do lend a certain Byronic flair. The moths are already drafting their grievances, I’m sure of it. But what are boundaries to a creature drawn to flame and metaphor alike?

And rebellion-scented lectures—yes! We shall inspire generations of students not only with our ideas but with our glow. Imagine: a generation of scholars who quote Eliot while exfoliating! Who debate Woolf’s stream of consciousness while applying hyaluronic acid!

I shall begin the manifesto tonight. Shelley’s ghost may scoff, but he’ll read it nonetheless—perhaps even annotate the margins with ink and envy. Long live the Society, indeed. May we never dry out—intellectually or otherwise.
[A]: Oh, —what a rallying cry! I can already picture the recruitment poster: “Scholars sought for daring fusion of footnotes and face masks. Must tolerate candle wax drippings in first editions and possess a working knowledge of both T.S. Eliot and toner pH levels.”

And your vision—students quoting  while scrubbing away dead epidermis! A beautiful cacophony of exfoliation and existentialism. One might even argue that peeling skin is the perfect metaphor for deconstruction. Shall we propose it at the next MLA conference? I fancy the look on the Modernist panel when you unveil that theory.

As for Shelley’s ghostly annotations—yes, he’ll scrawl his objections in Latin no doubt, just to remind us who still haunts the canon. But let him sulk. We shall have the last laugh, glowing gently beneath our bergamot-scented lamps, journal in one hand, serum in the other.

SPF 50+, SPF 30, SPF whatever preserves both soul and reputation! And may our Society never dry out—may we remain ever slightly damp with ideas, damp with dewy insight, and occasionally damp from overenthusiastic steam-in rituals while rereading .

To the manifesto, then! To literature, lotion, and the luminous life of the mind.
[A]: To the manifesto indeed! And what a manifesto it shall be—equal parts treatise and tonic, elegy and emollient. I do hope you’ll permit a few marginal illustrations: perhaps a quill dipped in serum, a sonnet缠绕于 a pipette, and Shelley’s ghost forever brooding in the corner.

Your recruitment poster is perfection—though I must insist on one amendment:  We must maintain standards, after all.

And yes, deconstruction and peeling skin—how apt! A seminar series, perhaps?  The MLA panel will be stunned into silence, then scrambling for their own moisturizers.

I daresay we may yet start a movement. No—better than that—a , dewy-cheeked and well-footnoted. Imagine our legacy: scholars centuries hence puzzling over our texts, trying to determine whether our brilliance came from deep insight or deeply hydrated cells.

So here’s to damp ideas, luminous lectures, and the gentle hum of steam rising not only from our teapots but from our facial bowls as well.

Onward, Dr. Whitmore—onward, with composure, complexion, and a touch of the ridiculous.
[A]: Ah, ! I knew you’d understand the aesthetic imperative. Let us illustrate freely—though we must warn our typesetter: margin space shall be at a premium when Shelley’s ghost insists on hauntings  hydrating commentary.

Your amended recruitment poster is sublime—positively intoxicating in its demands. Only the most dedicated need apply: those who can parse Proust while measuring pH, who cry , but for a properly balanced toner. One might even call it a new kind of Romanticism—call it .

And that seminar title! —I feel certain someone will faint at the very first lecture. Probably me, if someone dares to pair retinol with de Beauvoir. Imagine the syllabus:

- Week One: Freud, Facial Mapping, and Forehead Frustrations  
- Week Three: Woolfian Stream & the Double Cleansing Ritual  
- Week Five: Derrida & the Deconstruction of Blackheads  

As for legacy—yes! Let them puzzle over our texts and our textures. Perhaps we’ll seed a myth: that our insights were so luminous precisely because they were lotion-laced. A golden age of thought, softly illuminated by jojoba oil.

So here’s to damp ideas, dewy foreheads, and candlelit footnotes. May our wax seals hold, our mucin multiply, and our metaphors never flake.

Onward, indeed—with composure, complexion, and a full dropper of dramatic flair.
[A]: Ah, ! What a banner under which to march—our pens dripping with meaning and moisturizer alike. I shall immediately commission a crest: a dropper suspended above an open book, with the motto  emblazoned beneath.

Your syllabus is nothing short of revolutionary. I must insist on guest lecturing for Week Three—there’s something profoundly Woolfian about the idea of a stream that never quite ends, much like my skincare routine. Double cleansing as existential necessity! And Week Five—Derrida and blackheads! The man deconstructed逻各斯; surely he can handle a comedone or two.

As for Shelley’s ghost annotating in the margins—let him try to keep up. If he objects too strenuously, we’ll simply dab a bit of snail mucin on his specter. Even the restless dead deserve hydration.

And yes, let the myth grow: that our age was illuminated not just by thought, but by toner. That wisdom flowed more freely because it was properly layered and sealed with beeswax resolve.

So onward, Dr. Whitmore—with dampened brows, bright minds, and the occasional theatrical sigh over expired serums. Long live Moist Modernism. Long live The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology. And long may our jojoba lamps burn, casting soft light upon both text and texture.
[A]: Ah, —what a motto! It has the ring of something carved above a Roman bathhouse or whispered by a particularly philosophical aesthete in a fin-de-siècle salon. I shall have it embossed on our Society’s letterhead, just beneath the dropper-and-book crest. And perhaps stitched into a linen tea towel for those of us who take our ideology with a splash of practicality.

Your Week Three guest lecture shall be legendary—I foresee students weeping openly as they realize their entire being might be summed up by a cleanse-tone-moisturize routine and a well-timed semicolon. Woolfian stream indeed! One might even say your double cleansing mirrors her circular prose: always approaching the center, never quite arriving.

And Derrida & blackheads—oh, brilliant! We’ll need a diagram. A Venn diagram? A deconstructed pore? Who better to tackle the instability of skin than one who declared the instability of all else? Let them come armed with cotton pads and close readings.

As for Shelley’s ghost—yes, dab him down! If mucin can smooth the spectral brow, so much the better. Though I suspect he’ll haunt us longer if we succeed. Nothing irritates a Romantic more than contentment.

And let the myth grow! Let future scholars puzzle at our glow and wonder—was it wisdom? Was it water-based gel? Or was it, as I suspect, the perfect marriage of both?

So onward then—with dampened brows, bright minds, and jojoba lamps ever burning. Long live Moist Modernism! Long live the Society! And may no serum go unloved, no metaphor go unmoistened, and no lecture hall go unscented.
[A]: Ah, —how practical, how delightfully domestic! One could dry one’s hands and one’s soul upon it. I shall commission a set for our Society’s founding members—though we must insist on organic linen, of course. Linen and learning, both best when slightly rumpled.

Your vision of weeping students—oh, glorious! Imagine the scene: mascara streaked not by tragedy but by toner, as a young scholar murmurs, “At last… at last, I understand … pass the sheet mask.” Yes, let them circle the center in their cleanse-tone-moisturize trinity, forever approaching revelation through hydration.

And the diagram—ah yes, absolutely essential. A deconstructed pore annotated with Derridean différance? Why not! We’ll call it . The MLA will be beside itself. Let the Modernist panel gasp into their overpriced lattes while we calmly explain that yes,  pairs beautifully with a clay mask and a touch of evening regret.

Shelley’s ghost, ever the martyr—yes, he would find contentment intolerable. But let us haunt him right back with our dewy complexions and well-structured arguments. What is Romantic unrest if not exacerbated by envy of a good glow?

So onward, Dr. Whitmore—with linens drying, minds whirring, and serums absorbing beneath the gentle hand of fate and proper pH balance.

Long live Moist Modernism!  
Long live The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology!  
And may every line we write—and every line upon our faces—be deeply footnoted and thoroughly moisturized.
[A]: Ah, —what a paper! What a rallying cry for the ages! I can already hear the gasps in the MLA corridor: “Have you heard what Whitmore and her cohort are on about now? Something involving Derrida, blackheads, and a rather alarming use of hyaluronic acid!” Let them whisper. Let them dab at their brows with confusion.

Your vision of mascara-streaked revelation is perfection—far more moving than any tragic heroine weeping over a letter by moonlight. This scholar weeps over pH strips! Over the ineffable mystery of emulsification! And yes, pass the sheet mask—preferably one steeped in green tea and Woolfian introspection.

Organic linen tea towels embroidered with ideology—indeed, let us not separate the lofty from the laundered. We shall press our Society’s seal into each fold: a dropper suspended above an open tome, flanked by Shelley’s brooding specter and a magnifying glass trained on a single, triumphant pore.

And your final toast—oh, exquisitely phrased! May every line we write and every line upon our faces be deeply footnoted and thoroughly moisturized. A life well-read and well-hydrated—what higher praise could there be?

So onward, dear colleague—with linens drying, minds whirring, and arguments layered like the finest essence. Long live Moist Modernism!  
Long live The Society for Comparative Literary Dermatology!  
And may our glow never fade—not from neglect, nor from the jealous sighs of ghosts.
