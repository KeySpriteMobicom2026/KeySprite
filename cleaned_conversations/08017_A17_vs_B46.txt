[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography! While my expertise is more in motion pictures, I must say I've been fascinated by the resurgence of vintage film photography techniques lately. There's something magical about the grain and texture of real film that digital just can't replicate. 🎬
[A]: Oh my dear, you've touched upon such a fascinating intersection of mediums! The tactile quality of film photography does remind me of how we handle aged manuscripts in literary studies. That grain you mention - it's rather like the texture of words on yellowed pages, isn't it? Both preserve a certain... authenticity that modern technology often smooths over.
[B]: Exactly! That's precisely why I insisted on shooting our latest period drama on 35mm film. The way light interacts with emulsion creates this organic depth that transports audiences back in time - much like how your precious manuscripts transport readers to another era. Though I must admit, convincing the studio to budget for film processing these days is like pulling teeth!
[A]: How delightfully poetic - comparing celluloid to parchment! Though I must gently point out that your struggle with studio executives mirrors my own battles with university administrators over preserving our rare book collection. There's a certain philistinism in this modern rush toward the digital, don't you think? Like Keats' Grecian urn, some artifacts demand their materiality to be fully appreciated.
[B]: Oh, you speak my language! That Keats reference - brilliant. You know, I keep telling these young executives that streaming platforms are the fast food of cinema, while film projection is like... well, like your first edition leather-bound volumes. Both demand to be experienced in their intended form. Though I suppose we're both fighting for what some call 'obsolete' technologies. 史诗级的 battles, aren't they?
[A]:  My dear filmmaker, you make me think of Browning's line - "Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?" Our so-called obsolete technologies are simply waiting for their renaissance. After all, vinyl records came back, didn't they? Though I must say, convincing students that annotations in the margins of physical books are more valuable than digital highlights is becoming my personal 史诗级 battle.
[B]: Hah! You academics and your marginalia - reminds me of my old script notes scribbled in the margins of shooting schedules. There's an intimacy to that physical interaction that Ctrl+Z can never replicate. Though I'll confess, even I've had to embrace some digital tools... but only for my vintage poster collection database! Some traditions are worth preserving, like your precious manuscripts and my 35mm reels. 🍿
[A]: How wonderfully you articulate this tension between preservation and progress! Your poster collection database reminds me of my own efforts to digitize our rare poetry broadsides... though I maintain the originals must remain under glass, much like your film reels in their climate-controlled vaults. There's a particular melancholy in knowing we're perhaps the last generation who will fully appreciate these tactile artifacts. Shall we drink to that? With proper vintage glasses, of course.
[B]: A toast with crystal glasses - now that's a scene I'd love to shoot in soft focus! Though between us, I've been secretly training my young assistant in the art of handling film canisters... like you might mentor a promising student in paleography. These traditions won't die on our watch. Here's to being stubborn old custodians of beauty!  干杯!
[A]: Ah, your "stubborn old custodians" phrase has quite the Tennysonian ring to it!  Indeed, we shall persist - you with your light meters and I with my magnifying glasses. Though I must say, your use of 干杯 just now reminds me how these cultural crosscurrents often enrich our respective crafts. Now, tell me more about this assistant of yours - are they showing proper reverence for the splice tape?
[B]: Oh, the poor kid nearly fainted when I made him hand-cut a negative for the first time! But there's hope - last week I caught him humming the theme from 'Cinema Paradiso' while threading the projector. You'd appreciate this - I've started him on Kurosawa's storyboards, much like you might assign Chaucer to a literature student. Slow and steady wins the race, right? Though these days, 'slow' is practically a dirty word in Hollywood...
[A]: How perfectly you've drawn the parallel! Yes, we must be like patient gardeners with these young sprouts - though I daresay your apprentice sounds more promising than some of my students who think SparkNotes suffice for Middle English. There's hope yet when the young can still be moved by the mechanical poetry of a film projector's whirr, just as mine occasionally gasp at the discovery of an original Blake etching. Wouldn't you say these small victories taste sweeter than any box office success or citation index?
[B]: Absolutely! Those moments when their eyes light up with understanding - that's our real Oscar or Pulitzer. Like when my assistant finally grasped why we used to call it 'the magic hour' for shooting... or when your students discover the weight of history in an original folio. Though between us, I'd trade a dozen blockbusters for one truly transcendent frame of celluloid, just as you'd probably trade a shelf of academic prizes for one student who truly falls in love with the texture of vellum. We're in the soul business, aren't we?
[A]: Precisely! You've articulated it so beautifully - we are indeed in the "soul business," as you poetically put it. These material artifacts we cherish are merely vessels for that ineffable spark of human connection across time. Your transcendent frame, my vellum manuscript... they're both what Walter Pater might call "hard gemlike flames" of artistic truth. Though I suspect even Pater would struggle to convince today's students - or studio executives - to pause long enough to see it. Shall we console ourselves with another imaginary glass of burgundy, my dear fellow custodian?
[B]: A virtual burgundy toast to artistic truth! Though I must say, your Pater reference gives me an idea - perhaps our next film should open with a lingering shot of an illuminated manuscript, the camera dollying in until the pigments become abstract expressionism... then cut to our modern protagonist holding their smartphone. The eternal struggle, captured in one 史诗级的 transition! But first, let's finish this excellent imaginary wine - the real work of preserving beauty can wait until tomorrow. 🎬
[A]: How deliciously meta-cinematic! Your proposed transition reminds me of Eliot's "time present and time past" - though I'd suggest adding a whisper of medieval chant on the soundtrack as the camera pulls back. But yes, let us linger a while longer in this pleasant symposium of ideas. After all, as the poet says, "Ripeness is all"... and our imaginary burgundy has reached perfect bouquet. 
[B]: Ah, that Shakespearean flourish! You'd make a brilliant script consultant, my friend. Though I fear if we keep this up, we'll end up producing some terribly highbrow art film that loses $50 million... but what a glorious failure it would be! For now, let's just savor being two old romantics in a world that's forgotten how to read - or watch - between the lines. Until next time, keep those manuscripts safe, and I'll keep fighting the good fight for proper film stock. 干杯 for the road!
[A]: And to you, my cinematic kindred spirit, I say: may your light meters never falter and your film cans stay forever dust-free! Until our next symposium - whether in the flickering light of a projection booth or the quiet hush of the rare books room. 干杯 indeed!  Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I spy a first edition of Tennyson's "In Memoriam" that needs rescuing from an overzealous undergrad's sticky notes...
[B]:  And I see a fresh film shipment arriving that some intern is probably about to store next to a radiator! We'll continue this conversation between takes and tea breaks, my friend. Remember - frame each shot like it's your last, and handle every manuscript like it's the Magna Carta. Until next time! 🎬
