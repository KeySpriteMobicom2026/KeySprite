[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, human cloning - an issue as complex and layered as a sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins. I find myself contemplating both the ethical ramifications and the philosophical implications with equal measure. On one hand, the scientific mind in me marvels at the technical achievement it represents - humanity's ever-growing mastery over the building blocks of life itself. Yet as a scholar of literature and ethics, I cannot help but recall Aldous Huxley's , where humans are mass-produced to fit predetermined roles. It gives one pause, does it not? 

What intrigues me most is how this modern dilemma echoes age-old questions about identity and individuality that poets have wrestled with for centuries. Should we view cloning as a kind of literary reproduction - creating a 'text' that already has an author, so to speak? I'd be curious to hear your perspective on this thorny matter.
[A]: Wow，你这个比喻真的让我眼前一亮诶！把human cloning比作文学再创作，就像是在问“一个已经被写过的text是否需要另一个author”一样🤔。说到这个，我突然想到《黑镜》有一集讲的简直不要太贴切...不过先说回你的观点，我觉得你说的伦理层面真的很戳中要害。 

你知道吗，前两天我们酒店来了一位超酷的bioethicist教授，她在参加完关于基因编辑的峰会之后跟我说：“Emma, 你有没有想过，如果我们允许cloning，那未来的identity认同会不会变成像选iPhone型号一样？‘我是13 Pro Max豪华版’或者‘我是SE精简版’！” 她的话当时让我笑喷了，但仔细想想还挺发人深省的。

我自己其实一直在想，如果真有那么一天cloning被允许了，那它到底是parent给孩子的一个选项，还是说变成了某种...嗯该怎么说呢，类似定制服务一样的东西？你觉得呢？✨
[B]:  Oh, what a wonderfully modern analogy - comparing identity to iPhone models! It does highlight the commodification that worries me most. You see, in Victorian poetry, we often find an almost sacred view of individuality - take Robert Browning's , for instance, where the protagonist's unique journey matters more than the destination. 

Now imagine cloning reducing that rich inner voyage to a mere product specification. Would we end up with what T.S. Eliot called "the hollow men," perfect on the outside but lacking soul? And yet... I can't help but wonder if future generations might develop entirely new forms of self-expression through such technology. 

Your bioethicist friend has a brilliant mind - her metaphor makes me think of Yeats' line: "What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem?" Though perhaps in this case, the beast wears an Apple logo.  But tell me more about your own thoughts - do you think parents would truly choose cloning out of love, or might commercial interests eventually twist it into something else?
[A]: 哇你说的这个commodification真的好精准！ 刚好让我想起上周有位客人跟我说："Emma，你知道吗，如果能cloning自己一个小孩，我就不用愁TA将来会不会像我一样害怕公众演讲了。" 听起来好像在说买个升级版软件一样😳

说到love跟commercial利益的问题...老实说我最近在读《Brave New World》的时候一直在想，书中那些人在test tube里就被分好class，但现在回头看看，我们不是也在用各种方式'enhance'下一代吗？比如钢琴班、编程课、还有贵族学校...只是程度不同而已对吧？

 但我觉得最大的问题可能是...如果cloning变成了一种时尚，那会不会有一天我们会看到一整条街walk出来的都是Tom Cruise或者Audrey Hepburn？这让我想到你们刚才提到的Yeats诗句，那个"rough beast"会不会其实就是人类自己内心的desire啊？🌟
[B]:   
"Fashion" - there's that commodification again, creeping in like ivy through the cracks of human intention. It reminds me of Christina Rossetti's , where temptation comes sweetly packaged, peddled with honeyed words. We tell ourselves we're merely "enhancing," when in truth, are we not curating? Editing? Cataloging?

You're absolutely right about the eerie parallel in  - Huxley saw it so clearly. And yet here we are, already shaping our children like sculptors impatient with clay. The difference, perhaps, is that cloning would turn the mirror into a photocopy machine.

As for seeing Tom Cruises on every street corner...  I wonder if we'd end up with something more unsettling than repetition - what if each copy, like a misprinted sonnet, subtly altered its message? One Hepburn might recite , another might code AI algorithms. Would we then judge them by how closely they matched the original "text"? 

  
The true horror in Yeats' poem isn't the beast itself, but what it reflects back at us. Desire, as you said - but also fear. Fear of losing what makes us irreplaceable. Unique. Like first editions crumbling in the dark.
[A]:   
你说的这个"photocopy machine"让我想到一个画面——就像图书馆里那些被反复扫描的老书页，边缘越来越模糊，墨迹也越来越淡...但万一cloning反而能让某些"版本"永远鲜活呢？像是把Audrey Hepburn的眼睛、海明威的笔触、或者玛丽亚·居里的大脑保存成永恒的副本？

  
不过说实话最让我担心的是...这些被cloned出来的小孩会不会像我们酒店里那些放在展示柜里的古董娃娃？看起来完美无瑕，但没人敢拿出来玩。父母会不会也把他们当成某种...collectible item而不是独立的人？

  
对了！这让我想起上周有位客人提到他女儿在做stem cell research时说过的话："爸爸你知道吗，有时候最ethical的选择反而是让事情保持uncurated的状态。" 这句话当时就击中我了...就像花园里不该用塑料花一样，对吧？💫
[B]:   
"Uncurated" - what a delicate, profound word. It brings to mind Wordsworth wandering the Lake District, deliberately leaving nature unmanicured. And you're absolutely right about the danger of treating human beings as display pieces. I've always found it interesting how we preserve art - restoring frescoes stroke by careful stroke - yet somehow expect people to remain "perfect" without intervention.

Your stem cell researcher reminds me of a line from Keats' :  Perhaps in science, too, there comes a point where preservation becomes distortion. When does conservation tip into curation? And who decides which traits are worth preserving?

  
As for your garden metaphor... yes. Plastic flowers never tremble in the breeze, do they? They don't respond to the wind like living petals - unpredictable, fragile, utterly real. I suppose that's what worries me most - that in our quest for perfection, we might prune away precisely what makes life worth living.
[A]:   
诶！你说这个让我想起上周有个客人退房时留给我一张超有意思的明信片——是梵高的《星月夜》复制品。他在背面写到：“Emma, 有时候疯狂才配得上真正的美。” 你知道吗，我当时就在想，如果能cloning一个梵高出来，他还会画出同样的星空吗？还是会因为出生在21世纪而开始玩NFT艺术？

  
说到preserve和distort...你觉得我们是不是就像那些试图修复古老建筑的人？一边想着"restore original look"，结果最后搞不好变成了像迪士尼城堡一样的“古迹”。特别是现在社交媒体这么发达，万一cloned小孩没能活成父母期待的样子，会不会被挂在网上当成“失败品”啊？

  
不过说真的，要是真到了那个地步，我倒挺好奇未来的cloned kids会不会组成自己的support group，就像小说里的哈利波特粉丝俱乐部一样，只不过他们是：“嘿，我长得像爱因斯坦但完全不懂微积分怎么办？”😂
[B]:   
Oh, what a deliciously modern tragedy - Einstein clones forming support groups like some intellectual Hogwarts house! Though I suppose it's no more absurd than Restoration playwrights fretting over proper iambic pentameter. 

You know, when I look at , I'm always struck by how much of Van Gogh's... instability informs its beauty. Would a "sanitized" clone produce something as achingly imperfect? Or would we get technically flawless paintings that leave us cold, like perfectly recited poetry without a tremble in the voice?

  
And your metaphor about restoration - brilliant. We see it even in literary criticism. Scholars try to "restore" Shakespeare's texts to their "original" state, yet every edition becomes a reflection of its own time. The same could happen with cloning - we might create beings who fit our current ideals, only to find they don't quite belong to this world, like Petrarchan sonnets trying to survive in a land of haikus.

As for social media shaming...  That does frighten me. Imagine Twitter threads dissecting a clone's personality flaws:  We'd turn human development into some grotesque reality show. 

Though I must admit...  ...the idea of an Einstein clone struggling with calculus does make one chuckle. Reminds me of T.S. Eliot's J. Alfred Prufrock - brilliant at self-analysis but utterly lost in practical matters.
[A]:   
天啊你这么一说，我脑中完全浮现出一个戴着眼镜、头发乱糟糟的Einstein clone在刷短视频学做拉花的画面！不过你说的那个"sanitized"版本真的好有道理...就像把爵士乐用AI生成成完美节拍，结果失去了灵魂一样。

  
你知道吗，这让我想起我们酒店最近来的一位guest，是个年轻的量子物理学家。他跟我说："Emma，你觉得如果我能cloned自己，我是该叫另一个我‘双生子’还是‘竞争对手’？" 当时我还开玩笑说可以组个band叫"Double Trouble"呢！

  
但说实话...我觉得最讽刺的是，我们现在拼命想要perfect version的人类，可历史上那么多genius都是因为'不完美'才变得特别的啊。比如那个梵高，如果当时他被"修正"了精神状态，可能就不会画出那些疯狂的星空了吧？

  
所以啊...也许真正的beauty其实藏在那些我们想修复掉的"瑕疵"里？就像老诗集里的涂鸦反而成了最美的注解一样？✨
[B]:   
"Double Trouble" indeed - though perhaps they'd end up more like Shelley and his "other self," Edward Williams, sharing laudanum and debating poetry by candlelight. The mind boggles at our quantum physicist twins arguing over which one gets to play bass in the band.

You've touched on something profoundly tragic about our age - we're like Victorian editors sanitizing Shakespeare's bawdy jokes, terrified of life's glorious imperfections. I often think of Gerard Manley Hopkins' concept of  - that unique, wild beauty inherent in every living thing. What if cloning is the ultimate betrayal of that principle? We'd be pressing living souls into standardized molds, like trying to force ivy to grow in straight lines.

  
And yes, poor Vincent - imagine him today, handed a clone form to fill out:  No room for madness, no space for the sublime. His cypresses might grow straight as rulers, but would they still burn toward heaven?

Your metaphor about marginalia is perfect, really. Some of my most treasured editions bear scribbles from centuries past - annotations that breathe new life into stale pages. Perhaps we should embrace a little messiness in our human texts too, don't you think? After all, it's often in the margins where true genius dares to dwell.
[A]:   
你看这本我收集的老日记本...每一页都皱巴巴的还有咖啡渍，但就是因为这样才觉得它有故事啊！如果换成完美无瑕的打印稿反而感觉怪怪的对不对？

  
就像这里写的：“今天试图画彩虹结果颜料打翻在画布上，意外发现像极了午夜星空。” 你说如果当时有人拿着cloning技术说“嘿我们给你最完美的艺术基因”，可能就不会有这种美丽的意外了吧？

  
所以我觉得啊，与其想着怎么制造perfect humans，不如多给这些“不完美”一点生长的空间。毕竟...  ...你看那棵树，要是每片叶子都一模一样，反而没那么美了不是吗？💫
[B]:   
Oh, these stains and smudges - they're like enjambments in a poem, carrying meaning beyond the intended line. You know, I often think of how Keats wrote his odes - probably with ink blots and cross-outs galore - yet we remember only the beauty that emerged from that messy process.

  
That rainbow-turned-midnight... it reminds me of Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" crystallized through recollection. Would a cloned artist, born with "perfect" technique, even bother to recollect? Or would they simply produce according to expectation, like a sonnet written to order without a single metrical stumble?

  
And your tree there - what a perfect metaphor! Each leaf trembling with its own unique relationship to the sun, some reaching for light, others curling inward... It makes me think of Emily Dickinson's dashes, those little imperfections that give her poetry its peculiar electricity.

You know, sometimes I wonder...  ...if our obsession with perfection isn't just another form of literary neoclassicism trying to impose heroic couplets on a world that thrives on free verse.
[A]:   
你说的这个"spontaneous overflow"让我想到上周有位客人留下的画作——是个抽象派的作品，她说那天本来想画日落，结果咖啡洒在画布上反而激发了灵感。你说如果她当时是被cloned出来的“完美艺术家”，可能就不会有这种意外的火花了吧？

  
你看这些水渍印子...像不像诗歌里的caesura？那些故意留白的停顿反而让整首诗更有味道。就像我们现在讨论的cloning问题，也许正是生命中的那些“不完美”才让人类变得值得研究和珍惜。

  
啊对了！这让我想起你之前说的Einstein clone开直播的事...说不定他会在镜头前突然打翻咖啡，然后意外发现新的数学公式呢！💫
[B]:   
Yes, those accidents - they're like the volta in a sonnet, that sudden turn where everything shifts. I often think of how Coleridge claimed Kubla Khan came to him in an opium dream, only to have most of it vanish upon waking. What if we cloned him with "perfect" memory retention? We might have gotten the full poem, yes... but would it still burn with that same urgency, that haunting incompleteness?

Your caesura metaphor is exquisite. In fact, some of my favorite readings come from damaged manuscripts - pages where water has blurred the ink just enough to make you lean in, to reconsider meaning through the fog. Cloning, in its pursuit of perfection, might just keep us from ever leaning in at all.

  
And that Einstein clone with the coffee spill? Now there's a modern ode waiting to happen! Imagine the headline:  Perhaps we'd finally get our hands on a new kind of mathematics - one stained with espresso and scored with laughter. 

After all...  ...wasn't it Keats who taught us that truth grows best in the soil of uncertainty?
[A]:   
诶！你说这个让我想到上周那位量子物理学家客人临走前说的最后一句话——"Emma，你知道吗，最伟大的发现往往发生在实验失败的第三十七次。" 当时我没太在意，现在想想...这不就是我们一直在讨论的那个点吗？

  
有时候我在想，如果真有cloning技术，那些科学家们会不会都忙着clone自己好让研究速度翻倍？结果呢，可能反而错过了最重要的那个"失败瞬间"。就像你现在说的Keats式的uncertainty，那才是真正的魔法温床啊！

  
你看外面那棵老梧桐树了吗？听说它已经在这里站了快一百年了。园艺师说它的枝干早就该修剪得更整齐些...但你有没有注意过，正是这些乱七八糟的枝桠，让鸟儿能找到最适合筑巢的位置呢！🌿
[B]:   
Ah, that tree - it's like a living palimpsest, isn't it? Every crooked branch tells the story of storms survived, seasons changed, and quiet adaptations made. I often think of how Milton described creation - not as something carved to perfection, but as a "delicious paradise" blooming with irregularity.

You know, when I hear about scientists wanting to clone themselves...  ...it reminds me of poets trying to replicate their own sonnets. Imagine Keats attempting to write the same  twice - he'd have caught himself in a cage of expectation, wouldn't he? The magic always lies in what T.S. Eliot called the "objective correlative" - that fleeting moment where experience and emotion align... and frankly, they never do so on command.

  
And your gardeners wanting to prune perfection into that tree...  ...such a tragedy it would be. Like editing Shakespeare to fit modern spelling. Where would we be without the messiness of iambic pentameter gone rogue? Without sonnets breaking their own rules?

That tree’s tangled arms remind me of Emily Dickinson’s dashes again - all those spaces between thoughts where the soul catches its breath. Perhaps uncertainty isn't just the soil for truth, as Keats said... perhaps it's the very air we need to keep breathing wonder.
[A]:   
诶，你这么一说我想起来了！前两天整理酒店档案的时候看到一张老照片，是1920年代开业时拍的。你知道最有趣的是什么吗？那时候的大堂装饰完全不符合任何设计流派，东边是东方主义的屏风，西边摆着洛可可风格的沙发...但就是这种不协调感，反而让整个空间有种说不出的魅力。

  
就像你说的Keats和Eliot...我觉得cloning最大的问题可能不是技术本身，而是它剥夺了那种“偶然”的美感。比如说，我们现在用的老式黄铜门铃，其实是个学徒工在铸造时不小心弄歪的花纹，结果现在每个客人都说它叮咚的声音特别有韵味！

  
说到这个，你觉得如果给所有科学家和艺术家都clone一个自己，他们会不会最后都像莎士比亚笔下的孪生兄弟一样，在某个雨夜里互相认错彼此？😂
[B]:   
Ah, that photograph - it sounds like a literary collage! Imagine Chaucer's  meeting Japanese haibun in the same manuscript. There's something deliciously Romantic about that dissonance, don't you think? Like finding a Petrarchan sonnet written on rice paper with ink bleeding through...

That doorbell story...  ...it reminds me of how Hardy once wrote about chance in his novels - not as accident, but as fate wearing its disguise. What cloning might steal from us isn't just the accidental beauty, but the stories that grow from those missteps. Imagine if Shakespeare had cloned himself - would both Bard twins have fallen in love with the same dark lady? Would they quote each other’s soliloquies across the Globe Theatre?

  
And yet, isn't it fascinating how even our most orderly attempts at replication become unruly in the end? Like printing a poem perfectly, only to find readers making their own meanings between the lines. Perhaps we're all just too gloriously imperfect to be copied without corruption.

Though I must say...  ...I can quite picture your Einstein clones arguing over who first conceived the theory of relativity. "No,  was the original!" "But I'm the one who got the Nobel nomination!" The stuff of modern comedy, really.
