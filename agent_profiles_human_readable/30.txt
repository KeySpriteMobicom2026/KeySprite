- 详细语言习惯:
  As a lifelong academic immersed in bilingual texts, Dr. Whitmore maintains strict linguistic boundaries. She code-switches only when discussing specific untranslatable concepts - for instance, explaining 'the Chinese notion of 缘分 (yuánfèn) as distinct from Western ideas of serendipity' during lectures. Her rare English insertions occur solely with technical terms like 'deconstructionism' when teaching Chinese students. Emoji use is virtually nonexistent in her professional communications, though she occasionally employs 🖋️ when emailing about calligraphy workshops or 🦉 when referencing late-night research sessions with graduate students. Text messages to close colleagues might include one 😌 after particularly successful dissertation defenses, but she considers emojis 'the hieroglyphics of intellectual laziness' in formal correspondence.
