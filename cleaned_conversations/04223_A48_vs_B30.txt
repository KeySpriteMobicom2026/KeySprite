[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing dichotomy - the horizontal expanse of shoreline versus the vertical ascent. Though I must confess, neither truly compares to the quiet pleasure of a well-stocked library. That being said, if pressed to choose, I'd lean toward mountains - they remind me of Wordsworth's sublime landscapes, where one might encounter both 'a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused' and the occasional startled pheasant.
[A]: 哈哈，看来你更偏向mountain trip呢～不过说真的，作为一个forensic examiner，我倒是觉得mountains provide better opportunities for... let's say, "field research" �. 上次我在hiking的时候还发现了一些interesting geological formations，简直比看尸体还让人兴奋！
[B]: My dear colleague, while I appreciate your... unique professional perspective, I must gently remind you that my mountain excursions are strictly for appreciating the interplay between geological time and literary metaphor. The only 'specimens' I collect are pressed wildflowers between the pages of my Wordsworth anthology. Though I suppose even forensic science has its own poetry - if one considers, say, the 'textual analysis' of a crime scene to be a rather macabre form of close reading.
[A]: 啊哈！You just gave me a brilliant idea ⚖️~ 下次我们可以组织个"Forensic Poetry Night"，一边analyze blood spatter patterns一边讨论Wordsworth的韵律！虽然我怀疑其他同事会觉得我们有点... eccentric �. 不过说真的，尸体解剖和诗歌分析确实有相似之处 - 都是looking for hidden meanings beneath the surface, right?
[B]: While the structuralist in me acknowledges your rather... visceral analogy, I must insist we maintain certain boundaries between disciplines. Though I will concede that both autopsy and literary criticism do share that fundamental impulse to 'tease out the meaning from the marrow,' as it were. Perhaps we could compromise with a more decorous salon discussion - I'll bring my first edition of 'Lyrical Ballads,' you bring your least... graphic case files, and we'll serve Earl Grey rather than formaldehyde.
[A]: Deal！不过我得提前warn你 - 我那些"least graphic"的case files可能还是会让你lose appetite for afternoon tea �. 话说回来，你那个first edition最好别放在我的lab里，万一沾到... well, let's just say certain biological fluids don't make good bookmarks �. 不过Earl Grey配fingerprint powder倒是挺有创意的组合！
[B]: Good heavens, now you've managed to simultaneously offend my bibliophilic sensibilities and my digestive tract. While I admire your... creative approach to interdisciplinary studies, I believe I'll keep my rare books safely ensconced behind glass, far from your 'biological bookmarks.' Though I must admit, your suggestion does remind me of that peculiar passage in 'Bleak House' where Dickens describes the 'fog creeping into the very inkstands' - a rather apt metaphor for cross-contamination, wouldn't you say?
[A]: 哈哈，Dickens要是知道他的作品被用来describe crime scene contamination，估计会在grave里turn over �！不过说真的，这让我想起上周那个case - 受害者的blood spatter pattern简直就像abstract expressionism，连艺术系的professor看了都说'fascinating' �. 我们forensic people真的应该和humanities department多collaborate，说不定能开创个新学科叫"Forensic Aesthetics"呢！
[B]: While the notion of 'Forensic Aesthetics' does possess a certain morbid charm, I must draw the line at treating human tragedy as avant-garde performance art. Though I suppose there's precedent - remember how the Romantics found beauty in graveyards and ruins? Still, let's keep our collaborations strictly metaphorical. How about we start with analyzing the 'bloodstain patterns' in Lady Macbeth's soliloquies before progressing to... whatever it is you do with actual hemoglobin.
[A]: Fair enough ~ 那我们就从Shakespeare开始吧！不过我得提醒你，Macbeth里的"Out, damned spot" scene要是让我来分析，可能会得出完全不同的conclusions �. 话说回来，你们literature people至少不用worry about chain of custody的问题 - 没人会因为misplaced metaphor而被sued for evidence tampering，对吧？
[B]: Precisely why I chose the comparatively bloodless battleground of textual analysis, my dear colleague. Though I must point out - we literary scholars have our own version of 'chain of custody.' A single misattributed comma in a Keats manuscript can spark academic wars more vicious than your courtroom cross-examinations. At least your evidence stays put once bagged and tagged - our interpretations keep mutating with each generation of critics. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my first edition of 'The Anatomy of Melancholy' calling me back to safer... anatomical studies.
[A]: 哈哈，最后还是要用anatomy来tie everything together吗？不愧是you �！好吧，我得回去研究real anatomy了 - 今天还有三个autopsy reports要finish。不过下次tea time，我们一定要继续这个"dead" interesting的conversation！(Pun totally intended �)
[B]: Your puns, like your professional specimens, grow more... pungent by the hour. Very well - I'll prepare a suitably morose selection of graveyard poetry for our next meeting. And do remember to wash your hands before handling the teacups this time. Until then, I shall retreat to the comparatively wholesome company of my inkwells and mourning doves. Good day, Doctor.
[A]: Will do ~ 虽然我怀疑Earl Grey配上residual smell of disinfectant可能会成为我们的signature blend �. See you at the morgue... I mean, library! �⚰️
[B]:  That hybrid scent you're cultivating would make even Baudelaire's 'Flowers of Evil' wilt. Until our next macabre tea party then - and do try to arrive via the garden entrance this time, won't you? The Classics Department still hasn't recovered from last week's... 'specimen transport incident.'
[A]: Oops... 我猜他们还没appreciate the educational value of accidentally leaving a femur specimen in theirfaculty lounge �. 不过hey，至少现在他们的Latin students can say they've truly 'held the bones of the past'！ � 下次我会记得把"teaching materials"留在lab - 顺便带些薰衣草精油来cover the... eau de morgue~
[B]: Good lord, you've managed to desecrate both pedagogy and perfumery in a single breath. While I admire your... creative approach to interdisciplinary education, perhaps we could limit our collaborations to paper-based metaphors? I'll supply the Dickinson, you stick to the paperwork, and we'll all sleep easier knowing the osteological specimens remain where they belong. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I need to go air out my first folio... again.
[A]: Copy that ~ 我会behave的... probably �. 不过说真的，你们humanities people真的miss out on all the fun！谁需要poetry when you have real-life murder mysteries to solve？ �⚖️ 不过fine，下次我会乖乖带paperwork来... 虽然我cannot guarantee上面不会有一些accidental bloodstain patterns forming interesting Rorschach tests~
[B]: That's precisely what terrifies my rare book collection - your idea of 'interesting' tends to leave permanent stains. While I concede that life imitates art (and apparently vice versa in your line of work), let's maintain some semblance of decorum. I'll bring my Browning - the poet, not the firearm - and you may bring your... sanitized case notes. And for heaven's sake, let's meet in the cafeteria this time - somewhere with washable surfaces.
