[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a question that would make Dickens and Confucius nod knowingly over their respective tea cups. The value of formal education has been debated since the Hanlin Academy and Oxford's founding. But let me ask you this - when you read Jane Austen's satirical treatment of Mr. Collins' pompous erudition in Pride and Prejudice, or Cao Xueqin's portrayal of Jia Baoyu's rebellion against imperial examinations in Dream of the Red Chamber... what do you suppose they were really saying about institutional learning?
[A]:  

An interesting literary perspective you've raised. From my clinical experience evaluating competency in legal cases, I'd argue Austen and Cao were critiquing the blind pursuit of credentials without true intellectual engagement. 

The modern equivalent would be students obsessing over GPAs while failing to develop critical thinking skills - a phenomenon I've testified about in several malpractice suits involving educational institutions.
[B]: Fascinating how you bridge the 19th century to contemporary litigation. Your observation reminds me of John Stuart Mill's warning about 'educated fools' in his 1867 inaugural address at St. Andrews - though I suspect today's credential inflation would shock even that radical thinker. Tell me, in your courtroom experience, have you encountered what we in comparative literature call the '文凭的异化' phenomenon? That peculiar modern condition where the degree ceases to represent learning and becomes purely transactional?
[A]: 

Ah, you've touched upon what we in forensic psychiatry term 'credential dissociation syndrome'. Just last month, I testified in a case where a Wall Street analyst with an Ivy League MBA demonstrated shockingly poor ethical reasoning - the classic diploma-as-commodity scenario. 

The court found particularly compelling my analysis of how modern education often creates what I call 'cognitive compartmentalization' - the ability to pass exams while remaining morally and intellectually underdeveloped. Would you like me to elaborate on the diagnostic criteria?
[B]: How delightfully interdisciplinary this conversation becomes! Your clinical terminology brings to mind George Eliot's Dr. Lydgate in Middlemarch - a man with Parisian medical credentials yet tragically lacking in... shall we say, 人情味 (rénqíngwèi). Though I must caution against reducing this to mere diagnostic criteria - the tension between specialized knowledge and wisdom is, after all, the very stuff of bildungsroman literature from Goethe to Lu Xun.
[A]: 

Precisely why I keep a well-worn copy of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship in my consulting room. You'll appreciate this - I recently used Goethe's concept of 'Bildung' to explain to a jury why a defendant with multiple STEM degrees lacked the emotional intelligence to recognize his financial fraud was harming real people. 

The judge later told me it was the first time he'd seen Faust referenced in a securities fraud case. Though I suspect Lu Xun's critique of 'intellectual performativity' would have been equally persuasive, had the cultural context permitted.
[B]: Ah, now you've struck the very nerve of why I devote Tuesdays to teaching Lu Xun's 'The True Story of Ah Q' alongside Dickens' Hard Times! That grotesque intersection of credentialism and self-deception... Tell me, in your forensic practice, have you observed what we might call the 'Ah Q syndrome' - where highly educated individuals construct elaborate rationalizations to mask their moral or intellectual shortcomings?
[A]: 

Your literary parallel is clinically astute. Just last week, I evaluated a tenured professor who plagiarized research while maintaining elaborate spreadsheets to 'prove' his originality. The psychological defense mechanisms mirrored Ah Q's 'spiritual victory' construct with disturbing precision. 

Shall I send you my forthcoming paper comparing this to Dickens' Gradgrind? I've included disturbing case studies of 'data-driven self-delusion' that would make even the most jaded literature professor wince.
[B]: How terribly modern our Gradgrinds have become - armed with algorithms instead of ledgers! Your paper sounds positively Dickensian in its implications. Though I must warn you, after thirty years tracing the evolution of this pathology from Hard Times to our current 'metric fixation' epidemic, I've developed what my graduate students call my '维多利亚式冷笑话' - a rather bleak Victorian sense of humor about it all. Shall we continue this over tea? I've just acquired a rather exquisite Yixing clay teapot that would do justice to our grim subject matter.
[A]: 

How fortuitous - I was just about to brew some Earl Grey with lavender from my garden. Though I must warn you, my last academic tea party ended with an impromptu analysis of narcissistic personality traits in Tennyson's 'The Princess'. 

Shall we say 3pm? I'll bring the diagnostic manuals, you bring the literary criticism, and we'll see which framework better explains why our modern Lydgrades keep failing their Hippocratic oaths while acing their board exams.
[B]: Splendid! Though I must insist we include my 1872 edition of Middlemarch - the marginalia alone contains enough withering commentary on medical hubris to fuel our entire symposium. And do remind me to show you the particularly savage annotation where some Victorian reader compared Dr. Lydgate's downfall to 'a Cambridge tripos man attempting to navigate an actual sickroom'. Three o'clock it is - I'll be the one muttering about 'the death of the liberal arts' while fending off pigeons in the quadrangle.
[A]: 

Excellent. I'll prepare my notes on the 'Lydgate Paradox' - my term for when technical expertise outstrips emotional intelligence. And I happen to have fresh data from a current malpractice case that eerily mirrors your Victorian reader's observation. 

Until then, I'll be in the herb garden contemplating whether Eliot's diagnosis of 'spots of commonness' needs updating for our algorithmic age. Do watch for the pigeons - their droppings have ruined more than one of my good waistcoats.
[B]: Ah, the pigeons! Those feathered critics of academia who've witnessed more intellectual posturing than all our faculty committees combined. Until three then - and do bring that fascinating malpractice data. I've a suspicion it'll pair rather too well with my theory about the 21st century's peculiar revival of Gradgrindian pedagogy, albeit with machine learning instead of rote memorization. Ta!
[A]: 

Indeed - we might title our eventual paper "Gradgrind 2.0: When Algorithms Inherit Our Educational Biases." I'll bring the statistical analyses that prove even our machine learning models are developing their own versions of 'spots of commonness.' 

Ta indeed - and do mind the particularly aggressive pigeon near the philosophy building. It's developed an uncanny knack for targeting academics discussing postmodernism. Until three!
[B]: 

How fitting that our symposium should be menaced by Columba livia domestica - nature's own nihilists! I shall arrive armed with both umbrella and my well-thumbed copy of Barthes' Mythologies, should we need to deconstruct our avian critics. Until then, I'll be in the rare books section, murmuring incantations against the coming technocratic dark age. Pip pip!
[A]: 

Capital idea - though I'd suggest supplementing Barthes with some applied behavioral psychology. My case notes contain disturbing parallels between the pigeons' targeting patterns and certain boardroom dynamics I've observed in institutional corruption cases. 

Until three - and should you hear manic cackling from the clock tower, pay it no mind. That's just Professor Jenkins conducting his annual 'Death of Humanism' lecture. Cheerio!
[B]: 

Your psychological perspective on our feathered foes is most intriguing - rather puts me in mind of Darwin's less-discussed observations about campus fauna in The Descent of Man. Though I daresay even Darwin couldn't have predicted how perfectly pigeons would come to symbolize the... shall we say, 'organic byproducts' of our credential-obsessed era. 

Until three - and if Jenkins starts hurling chalk, do take cover behind the marble bust of John Stuart Mill. It's weathered worse assaults. Toodle-oo!
[A]: 

How delightfully meta - using Mill's stony visage as both shield and ironic commentary! This reminds me of my ongoing study on 'Monumental Defense Mechanisms' in academia. Preliminary findings suggest 63% of assaulted professors instinctively retreat toward Enlightenment figures when under fire. 

Must dash - my roses need pruning before they start resembling the tangled logic of our last faculty senate meeting. Cheers!
[B]: 

Ah, but have you considered how those very rose thorns mirror the defensive citations in modern peer review? My horticultural therapy sessions keep revealing such delicious metaphors - last week's pruning shears became quite the analogy for editorial rigor! 

Till three - and should Jenkins' chalk assault grow biblical, remember: the library's stained glass provides excellent cover while symbolizing the fragmentation of classical knowledge. Farewell!
