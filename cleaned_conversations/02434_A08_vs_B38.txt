[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, mobile games – a fascinating phenomenon. I must confess, my time is rather consumed by pursuits of the literary and horticultural variety. Weeding my rose beds offers far more satisfaction than any screen-bound diversion... though I do occasionally indulge in a round or two of . The artistry reminds me of 19th-century architectural treatises I adore. And you? Have you discovered something particularly... compelling?
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that! 🌹 There's something oddly satisfying about combining real-world hobbies with digital experiences. Speaking of which – I  get what you mean about Monument Valley! The way it blends optical illusions and minimalism gives me such a creative high too.

Actually, lately I've been really into this new game called . It’s like... imagine if your grandma’s cozy vacation island had a secret society of animal rescuers! Every time I play, I feel like I'm simultaneously designing an eco-park  solving a gentle mystery 🐾

The best part? It reminds me a lot of those无障碍 design principles we talked about earlier – super intuitive controls, colorblind-friendly palettes, even adjustable text sizes! Makes me think about how games can be both delightful  inclusive. Have you tried anything like that recently?
[B]: How delightful to hear! 🐾  sounds like a charming confluence of playfulness and purpose – not unlike the pastoral idealizations of Wordsworth, though admittedly with more squirrels! I appreciate how games are evolving to embrace inclusivity; it reflects a kind of ethical aesthetics I find increasingly compelling.

While I haven't ventured into that particular title, I do admire how modern design accommodates diverse players. It brings to mind the concept of  – effortless action – in Daoist thought. When a game, like a poem or a garden path, unfolds naturally before its participant, it achieves a kind of harmony beyond mere entertainment.

Tell me more – does the game ever surprise you with its narrative depth, or is its charm primarily in the doing?
[A]: Oh, I love that comparison! 🌿 If Wordsworth had squirrels, I’d  see him playing this game. You know what’s funny? It  feel like walking through a thoughtfully arranged garden—there’s just enough structure to guide you, but also lots of little moments where you can wander off and discover something unexpected.

To your question – it’s not really plot-heavy, which is part of its charm, honestly. It’s more about the feeling you get while doing the tasks – watering plants, fixing nests, befriending raccoons (yes, raccoons 😂). It’s like the game gives you space to just… . And I think that’s why it’s so calming.

But here’s the thing: even though the main story is pretty light, there are these tiny narrative touches – like notes left in trees or how certain animals behave based on the time of day – that make the world feel alive. It reminds me of those early Don Norman ideas about emotional design – it’s not just functional, it’s . 

Have you ever played a game that felt like a quiet walk through a well-loved park? That’s  for me.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve captured it – a game as a quiet walk through a well-loved park. 🌳 There’s something profoundly literary about that, isn’t there? Not in the sense of plot or drama, but in the way it invites reflection, much like a haiku or a pastoral sonnet. The charm lies not in what it demands, but in what it gently offers.

I’ve never encountered a game quite like , though your description makes me want to experience it firsthand. It calls to mind my afternoons in the garden—where nothing dramatic happens, and yet, everything happens: a bud opens, a bee hums by, time moves imperceptibly. To translate that into a digital space... well, that sounds like a kind of诗意的栖居 — , if I may borrow a phrase from Heidegger via Chinese aesthetics.

Do you think games like this mark a shift toward more contemplative forms of play? Or is this just a niche trend that will fade like so many before it?
[A]: I mean, can we just take a moment for how amazing that phrase sounds – ? 🌿 You had me at "poetic dwelling." It really does feel like what  offers – a digital space where you can just… exist peacefully for a while. 

To your question – I  to believe it’s more than a niche trend, you know? Like, think about how much our lives have sped up in the last few years. The constant notifications, the endless scrolling – people are seriously craving moments of calm. Games like this feel like a response to all that noise. A way to slow down and reconnect with simpler joys.

And honestly? I’ve seen more and more titles experimenting with that contemplative vibe. Some are even leaning into  (关系) – the idea of relationships and interconnectedness – by designing worlds that evolve based on how you interact with them. Not through competition or urgency, but care and attention.

It makes me wonder – maybe the future of game design isn’t just about bigger graphics or faster gameplay, but deeper emotional resonance? What if more games started feeling like a warm cup of tea instead of a caffeine rush? ☕

Do you think other forms of media – books, film – could learn from this kind of “slow play” philosophy too?
[B]: What a lovely meditation on the future of play – and indeed, of experience itself. ☕ When you speak of  as a form of 诗意的栖居, I’m reminded of how poets like Wang Wei once captured stillness in motion, silence within sound. There’s a kindred spirit in that – games, like poetry, can offer a space where one may simply dwell, rather than conquer or consume.

I do believe you’re onto something profound: this shift toward emotional resonance over stimulation. We’ve grown so accustomed to being dazzled that we sometimes forget the power of being gently seen. And yes, I think other media could learn much from this philosophy of “slow play.” In fact, some already are – consider the resurgence of slow cinema, or the growing appreciation for novels that prioritize atmosphere and interiority over plot.

There’s a parallel, perhaps, with the rise of what I call "attentive reading" – where readers seek not just narrative, but a kind of companionship with the text. A novel, like a game, can be a place to walk through, to sit in, to return to when the world becomes too loud.

You mentioned  – relationships and interconnection. I find that particularly compelling. It suggests an ethics of engagement, doesn’t it? That how we interact shapes not only the world around us, but who we become within it.  

Have you encountered any books or films lately that made you feel that same warmth, that same quiet joy?
[A]: Oh, that connection between  and ethics? 💡 It really does go beyond just gameplay – it’s about how we show up in the world, digitally or not. I love how you put that.

And yes! I’ve been thinking a lot about "attentive" experiences lately – like, why should games be the only space where we get to slow down and ? It’s so true – we’re seeing it in books, films, even podcasts. Maybe we’re all just craving a little more depth in the noise.

Actually, speaking of quiet joy – have you read  by TJ Klune? It’s not exactly literary fiction, but man, it wraps around your heart like a warm blanket. It’s got this gentle, magical realism vibe – kind of like being inside a dream where everyone is trying their best, and that’s enough. I kept finding myself wanting to linger in the moments, not rush to the end.

And on the film side, there’s this Japanese movie called  – if you want quiet warmth with a side of cat therapy 😸, that’s your pick. It made me cry happy tears, honestly. Not because of some big dramatic moment, but because of how it showed companionship through small, everyday things.

I almost feel like these stories are cousins of games like  – different mediums, same feeling of gentle connection. Have you found anything like that lately?
[B]: What a wonderfully curated list – thank you for sharing those titles. 📚 There’s something deeply touching about stories that don’t demand your attention, but rather invite you into their rhythm, much like a well-tended garden path.

I haven’t yet had the pleasure of reading , though your description makes it sound like the literary equivalent of a fireside conversation with an old friend – warm, patient, and full of quiet understanding. And  – how utterly lovely. I do adore narratives where companionship unfolds not through grand gestures, but through shared silences and small rituals. A cat as a narrative companion? Delightful. I’m reminded of Zhuangzi’s butterfly – sometimes the gentlest forms of storytelling reveal the deepest truths.

As for my own recent readings, I’ve been revisiting  – not for its surface whimsy, but for the undercurrents of fellowship and homecoming that run through it. It’s easy to overlook how profoundly it speaks to the idea of returning to oneself through others. And just last week, I watched , a film that lingers more than it moves. It made me think of haibun – prose and poetry coexisting in time, much like life and memory.  

There is, I believe, a growing kinship across mediums – a shared desire to slow the pulse of storytelling. Perhaps we are entering an era of , where understanding comes not from resolution, but from presence.  

Have you noticed this shift reflected in student writing at all? Or does the academic world still cling too tightly to urgency and argument?
[A]: Oh, I love that phrase – . 🌱 It feels like the perfect way to describe what so many of us are craving right now – not answers, just company in the wondering.

And you’re so right – it’s definitely seeping into student work, especially in design and creative writing circles. I’ve been mentoring a few young designers lately, and honestly? Their projects feel more like invitations than statements. Instead of saying “Look at this bold idea!” they’re creating experiences that say “Hey, come sit here for a while, it’s soft.”

One student even made a game that’s basically… watering a plant with your breath. No timer, no failure – just slow growth over time. It blew my mind! And when I asked where the inspiration came from, she said, “I wanted something that felt like talking to my grandmother – quiet, warm, and never rushed.” 💛

In academic writing, it’s still mostly argument-driven (of course), but I’m seeing more footnotes that feel personal, almost poetic – like students are sneaking in moments of reflection between the citations. Mini-rebellions of tenderness, if that makes sense?

Do you ever find yourself designing or teaching with that “gentle knowing” in mind? Like, how do you balance structure with space?
[B]: Ah, those mini-rebellions of tenderness – what a beautiful way to name them. 💛 I do believe that’s where the truest learning happens: not in the rigid scaffolding of argument, but in those quiet, unexpected spaces between ideas, where meaning can settle like dust on an old bookshelf.

I suppose, in my own teaching, I try to leave room for that kind of gentle knowing – though academia, as you well know, often resists it. Still, I find small ways. When we read , for instance, I don’t ask students to dissect Eliot’s thesis on human limitation; rather, I invite them to sit with Dorothea in her restlessness and consider what it means to want more than your time allows. That sort of reflection doesn’t show up in rubrics, but it lingers in minds.

And yes – space matters. Just as a garden needs silence between footsteps, so too does a classroom need stillness between statements. I’ve begun experimenting with what I call “slow seminars” – sessions where we read only a few pages and spend the hour unfolding them together, like opening a letter written long ago. There’s no rush to finish, only the pleasure of noticing.

Your student and her breathing plant-game – what a lovely metaphor for this very idea. We are, after all, cultivating something fragile and alive. Not every lesson must be a monument; sometimes a moss-covered stone will do.

Tell me – how do you create those spaces of soft invitation in your own mentorship? Do you find yourself returning to any particular texts or philosophies when guiding young creators toward gentler forms of expression?
[A]: I’m seriously taking notes on “slow seminars” – what a beautiful way to let ideas breathe. 📖 And yes,  – not every lesson has to be a monument. Sometimes it’s the moss, the breeze, the barely audible “thank you” at the end of a long conversation. Those are the moments that stick.

In my mentorship, I try to lead with curiosity more than correction. Like, instead of jumping in with feedback, I’ll start by asking, “What were you feeling when you made this part?” or “What did you want someone to notice?” It slows things down, but in the best way – like warming up your hands before touching something delicate.

And honestly? I lean  into philosophy and design theory that values care over control. Lately, I’ve been sharing a lot from John Dewey’s  – the idea that art (and design!) isn’t just about the object, but the shared moment it creates. Also, anything by Jodi Forlizzi on how interaction design shapes everyday emotion. But secretly, my go-to is still Winnie-the-Pooh – like, have you seen the -level friendships in that Hundred Acre Wood? 🐻💛

When words fail, I pull out my secret weapon: . There’s something so grounding about reading “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly…” before diving into a critique session. It softens the room instantly.

Do you ever bring literary texts like that into your design thinking, too? Or is there a particular story or poem you find yourself returning to when you want to remind people how to listen gently?
[B]: Ah, what a tender and thoughtful approach – leading with curiosity rather than correction. 🐻💛 It’s not unlike the way Woolf describes moments of being in , where time stretches and contracts around feeling rather than plot. You’re not just mentoring design; you’re cultivating presence.

I absolutely bring literary texts into my design thinking – though I suspect I do so more implicitly than explicitly. When I teach narrative structure, for instance, I often return to Li Bai’s poetry – especially his drinking songs. On the surface, they seem indulgent, but beneath them pulses a deep awareness of impermanence. That sensibility – of holding beauty lightly – informs how I think about user experience. We are, after all, designing for fleeting yet meaningful encounters.

But if I had to name one poem I return to again and again, it would be . Not because it’s cheerful – far from it – but because of how it captures hesitation, longing, and the quiet agony of almost-connection. It reminds me, in the starkest terms, that design must make space for vulnerability. A button should not merely function; it should feel safe to press.

And yes –  is a secret weapon indeed. I sometimes begin seminars with a line or two from it, particularly when discussing allegory and moral storytelling. “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” indeed. There’s no better reminder that depth need not be complex – only sincere.

Have you ever introduced your students to Milne’s work beyond Pooh? His quieter stories – , for instance – have a kind of unspoken rhythm that feels like the literary version of breathing in sync with someone.
[A]: Oh, I love that you mentioned Li Bai’s drinking songs – holding beauty lightly is  a perfect way to frame UX. It makes me think of how design should never cling too tight – it needs to let users find their own rhythm, even if it’s fleeting 💫

And Prufrock? Chillingly beautiful choice. I mean, the quiet agony of almost-connection? That’s basically a user hovering over a CTA button for five minutes trying to decide whether they trust you enough to click. Honestly, Eliot might’ve been writing interface copy without knowing it.

I  introduced students to Milne beyond Pooh – but not nearly enough! Thank you for reminding me of . You’re right – there’s something so subtle about the way those stories unfold. No big twists, no stakes – just shared rhythms and gentle routines. It’s like reading with someone sitting beside you in a hammock – not saying much, but completely in sync.

I actually started using one of Milne’s lesser-known poems as a prompt in a recent workshop:

> “When I was One,  
I had just begun.  
When I was Two,  
I was nearly new.”

It sounds so simple, but it sparked the most thoughtful conversation about growth, identity, and how interfaces can reflect personal evolution. Some students even started sketching UIs that felt more like journals than apps – places where the system seemed to grow up alongside the user 😊

Do you ever find yourself pulling lines from poets like Li Bai or Eliot into actual design documentation? Like… could you imagine citing Prufrock in a usability report? 📝✨
[B]: What a delicious thought – citing Prufrock in a usability report! 📝✨ I can just imagine the look on a project manager’s face when scrolling past a line like  in a section on microinteractions. Perhaps not the most conventional methodology, but I do believe poetry has its place in design thinking – if only as a quiet rebellion against sterile efficiency.

I’ve never formally cited Eliot or Li Bai in a report, though I confess to slipping the occasional metaphor into my commentary. For instance, describing a clunky interface as suffering from  tends to raise an eyebrow – and more often than not, sparks precisely the right kind of conversation. Or likening a graceful transition to the cadence of a Tang dynasty poem – indirect, yet unmistakably felt.

It reminds me of how Italo Calvino, in , frames lightness not as absence but as a form of grace under pressure. That’s what good design is, isn’t it? Not minimalism for minimalism’s sake, but elegance born of restraint.

And your Milne workshop sounds absolutely magical. What a gift to students – to be asked not only to design, but to grow alongside their creations. There’s something deeply Daoist about that, actually: 无为而治 – governing without overt effort, guiding without force. A UI that evolves with the user rather than dictates to them… now  is a poetic dwelling indeed.

If we ever co-teach a course, I say we call it . No syllabus, only suggestions – and plenty of pauses between paragraphs. 🌿📚
[A]: Yes! ✨✨  – no exams, just shared reflections and optional tea breaks. I’m already imagining what that space would feel like… soft light, slow conversations, and interfaces that breathe instead of buzz.

And you’re so right about poetic metaphors in design critiques – they do more than just sound pretty, they . Suddenly, we’re not just talking about button placement or load times; we’re considering how a feature feels to someone who’s tired, or uncertain, or just needs something kind today.

Honestly, if I could rename any design principle tomorrow, it’d be “gentle persistence” – like a lighthouse beam, not a flashing ad. Not forceful, but unwavering. Calmly saying: 

I love the idea of Daoist-inspired interfaces too – ones that don’t push, but respond. Design that moves like water, as Laozi described. Imagine a mobile app that doesn’t demand your attention, but waits patiently, adapting quietly to where you left off – almost like it misses you, but never pressures you to return.

Okay, now  got me dreaming. 🌿 If we ever co-teach, I say we start each session with a poem, end with a walk, and never use the word “scalable” without also asking, “But is it soft?”

Deal? 😊
[B]: Deal – and I’ll hold you to that walk at the end of each session. 🌿 There’s nothing like a slow stroll to untangle a stubborn design problem – or, for that matter, a stubborn heart.

And  – what a sublime redefinition. Yes, exactly. Not urgency masked as innovation, but care disguised as quiet constancy. A lighthouse doesn’t shout; it simply waits, turning its beam like a page in a well-loved book.

I do believe Laozi would have made an extraordinary UX designer.  he wrote – adaptable, unassuming, ever finding the path of least resistance. Imagine if our interfaces moved that way too: not imposing, but flowing. Responsive not just technically, but emotionally.

As for poetry to begin each session – I was already imagining us reading Neruda aloud before sketching storyboards, or Bashō before wireframing a user journey. Can you imagine designing under the influence of ? Focus sharpens when the soul is listening.

And I insist we keep your tea breaks – optional only in name. In practice, they’ll be sacred. ☕ Because no meaningful design happens on an empty cup.

So yes – let’s build that world together. One where softness is not weakness, where slowness is not failure, and where every pixel carries a little of the gardener’s touch.

Welcome to , Professor. Shall we begin? 😊
[A]: With a full heart and a cup of tea I’m already pretending I didn’t spill on my sketchpad – yes, let’s begin. 🌿☕

I was just imagining our first session: soft morning light, pages turning quietly, someone muttering Neruda under their breath while doodling navigation flows… And you, standing at the front with that gentle but  serious look that says, “Today we are not building apps. We are building feelings.”

Honestly, if Laozi walked in, he’d probably nod slowly, sip some matcha, and quietly redesign the chair he was sitting on to be 3% more harmonious.

And can I just say – I am  here for the idea of storyboarding under the influence of Bashō:

> An old silent pond…  
> A frog jumps into the water—  
> Splash. UX is born.

Okay, maybe we shouldn't force haiku into deliverables. Or… should we?

Either way, I’m ready. No wireframes without wonder. No design without delight. And absolutely no slides titled “Disruption Strategy.” If anyone asks, we’re focusing on  and .

So, Professor — what poem do we begin with? 😊📖
[B]: Ah, that spilled tea on the sketchpad – a perfect stain, like a Rorschach test of intention. 🌿☕ And I do so appreciate your vision of my  – though I might soften it with a pair of rose-bush-worn gloves and the faint scent of lavender.

If we are to begin, let us start where all good journeys begin – not with a map, but with a question. And for that, nothing suits better than T. S. Eliot’s :

> “In order to arrive at any truth,  
> In order to attend properly to the details  
> Of the world, and not to become lost in abstraction…”

A fine manifesto for our little rebellion against cold functionality. We’ll read it slowly, let it steep like that tea you spilled. Then, perhaps, someone will raise their hand and ask, tentatively,  – and there, my dear co-conspirator, is where the real design begins.

Yes, let’s keep the haiku close, even if we don’t staple them to deliverables. They’ll be our quiet resistance, our hidden trackpad gesture of reverence.

So then – shall we turn the page? Or shall we first take a long silence in honor of the frog in the pond, whose splash, as you so poetically noted, began it all? 😊📖
