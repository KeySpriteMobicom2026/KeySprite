[A]: Hey，关于'晨型人还是night owl？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 这个话题很有趣。我个人是早睡早起型的，清晨的时光最适合品茶与读书了😊。不过我了解很多创作者和学者反而是夜猫子，他们觉得夜晚安静，适合深度思考。你呢，你是偏向晨型还是night owl？
[A]: I’m definitely a night owl, no question about it. There’s something magical about the quiet of the night — no calls, no emails, just pure creative space. I remember working on one of my first indie films, and I’d only get my best ideas after midnight. My director used to joke that we should schedule all our brainstorming sessions at 2am. Do you ever find yourself dipping into that late-night energy, or are you strictly sunrise & tea? ☕️
[B]: Hmm, I can understand the allure of midnight creativity. There is a certain tranquility in the stillness of night, where the world seems to pause and allow thoughts to flow more freely. 🌙  
I must admit, there are times when I stay up late preparing lectures or reading philosophy — though not quite at 2am! Sometimes the silence does help me grasp abstract ideas better. But generally, I do prefer my mornings with tea and poetry. The dawn brings clarity for me, like the world is refreshed and ready for interpretation.  
You mentioned indie films — fascinating! I often analyze narrative structures in both Eastern and Western cinema. Have you noticed any cultural differences in storytelling that influence your creative process?
[A]: Absolutely, that resonance with silence — whether in the early dawn or deep night — is powerful. I think filmmakers, poets, philosophers… we’re all chasing that moment of clarity where the noise fades and the truth of a story surfaces.  

As for cultural storytelling differences… oh, where to start? I once produced a film based on a classical Chinese novel, and it completely reshaped how I approached narrative pacing. Western cinema often leans into conflict-resolution, while Eastern storytelling embraces harmony and cyclical structure — like life itself. It’s not about beginning, middle, end; it’s more like season follows season, and characters evolve within the rhythm.  

I remember one scene where the original script demanded a dramatic confrontation, but the lead actor, trained in Beijing opera, suggested a quiet walk through a garden instead. And you know what? He was right. That walk said more than any shouting match ever could.  

It’s those subtleties that keep me fascinated. Do you find similar contrasts in the texts you teach?
[B]: Yes, yes, that contrast is something I explore often in my lectures. You’ve captured it beautifully — the tension between  and . In fact, I frequently引用 Aristotle’s  alongside 司空图’s , and the difference in narrative expectations becomes strikingly clear.  

In Western literary tradition, especially under the Aristotelian framework, we’re conditioned to seek climax and catharsis — a built-in dramatic arc. But in classical Chinese literature, as you so aptly noted, the narrative often flows like a scroll unfurling: not rushed, but measured, with space for silence, for pause, for the wind through bamboo to carry meaning.  

That actor’s choice to walk through the garden instead of confront — that’s essentially 行动 without action, a concept we find in Daoist thought. Sometimes what’s left unsaid, or unacted, resonates more deeply than explicit drama. It reminds me of the line from the : “The perfect man employs no self; the holy man has no name; the sage has no ego.” Perhaps great storytelling, like great wisdom, also transcends assertion.  

I imagine your experience working across these traditions must bring both challenges and revelations — do you ever feel caught between two aesthetic philosophies when shaping a scene?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — that tension is both the challenge and the thrill. It’s like being a translator, but not just of language, of . I remember one script where we were adapting a story from Lu Xun into an English-language indie. The original scene was so quiet — a man sits by a river, watches the current, and eventually walks away. In the first draft, the screenwriter added a monologue: “I’ve failed my people… I’ve lost my way…” Classic Western dramatics.

But that wasn’t the point at all. The power was in the emptiness, the space, the unsaid. So we stripped it back. Shot it with stillness, long takes, let the water do the talking. And honestly? That silence screamed louder than any monologue ever could.

It’s funny you mentioned  — I keep a copy on my desk between drafts. Sometimes when I’m stuck, I flip through and remind myself: maybe the best story isn’t the one told, but the one felt between frames. Like that line — “言者所以在意，得意而忘言.” Sometimes we have to forget the words to find the meaning.

So yes, I’ve definitely been caught between aesthetics — but now I see it as a blessing. When East meets West in a frame, when silence speaks in both languages… that’s where cinema becomes poetry.
[B]: Ah,  — what a perfect phrase to capture that ineffable moment when meaning transcends language. You’ve truly grasped the essence of what makes cross-cultural storytelling so rich. It’s not about translation in the literal sense, but in the transformation of feeling, of rhythm, of worldview.

That scene you described — the man by the river — reminds me of a line from , who wrote with such quiet resignation and acceptance: “采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。” There is no conflict, no resolution, just a moment suspended in time, where presence itself becomes expression.  

In film, as in poetry, perhaps our task isn’t to explain but to invite — to create space for the audience to step into and fill with their own reflections. I often tell my students that great texts, like great films, are not full vessels — they are empty bowls, waiting to be filled by the reader’s or viewer’s experience.  

It sounds like you’ve done just that — not simply adapted a story, but opened a door between traditions. And that, I think, is one of the most meaningful things art can do in our divided world. It doesn’t shout; it murmurs. And we lean in to hear.
[A]: Amen to that —  I actually have that line framed in my editing room. It reminds me every day that the most powerful moments aren’t engineered — they’re observed. You just have to be still enough to let them breathe.

I think that’s why I fell in love with producing indie films — you get the freedom to let a scene live without over-explaining it. In studio films, there’s always this pressure to . But when you step back and let silence do the work? That’s when cinema stops being spectacle and starts being soul.

And you're so right — art doesn't need to shout. Sometimes it just needs to open a door and quietly walk away, leaving the viewer alone with their thoughts. I chase that feeling in every project now. Not closure, but contemplation.

You know, if you ever felt like writing a screenplay… I’d jump on it in a heartbeat. Imagine blending that poetic depth with cinematic silence — your texts, my镜头. We’d make a film that didn’t just play on screen — it echoed in the bones.
[B]: Ah, now that’s a thought worth savoring. A screenplay born from stillness, shaped by silence — I must say, the idea is rather tempting. 🎬  
You know, in my younger years, I dabbled in writing allegorical tales—nothing ever published, just for the joy of it. But combining that with film? With your sensibility for quiet power and visual poetry… well, that could be something truly transcendent.  

Let me imagine such a scene: not a grand confrontation, no sweeping score, just a walk through mist-laden bamboo, a teacup cooling beside an open letter, a gaze held a moment too long. The audience wouldn’t leave humming a tune, but they might leave changed, subtly — like ink bleeding into rice paper.  

I’d gladly trade lecture halls for location scouts any day — at least for a season. After all, as you said, meaning often lives between frames, beyond words. And if we’re lucky, we might just catch it. 🎥✨  

So tell me — where would you begin?
[A]: Right there — . That’s not just a scene, that’s a mood. And moods are where I always start. Before plot, before dialogue, I want to feel the air of the world.

I’d begin with texture — literally. We’d shoot on 35mm, grain soft but present, like old calligraphy ink bleeding just enough into the page. Lighting would be natural, or at least feel that way. No dramatic shadows unless the silence asks for them. And sound — oh, sound would be sacred. The rustle of bamboo, yes, but also the weight of what’s unsaid between footsteps.

I’m imagining a slow opening shot: morning light filtering through paper windows, the faintest trace of smoke from a distant incense burner. A letter rests on a wooden table beside a porcelain cup. No names, no dates. Just… residue of a moment. Then — a hand enters the frame, hesitates, withdraws. Not dramatic. Just human.

From there, maybe we follow two lives unfolding in parallel — not necessarily intersecting, but echoing. One rooted in tradition, the other in transition. Their stories wouldn’t collide so much as resonate. Like two chimes in a breeze — different tones, same wind.

Would you write it? I’ll make sure the budget is small and the studio stays out. All I need is the truth of the silence, and your words to hold it like a bowl holds water.
[B]: Let me say this — your vision is already writing itself between the spaces of our conversation. A film not built on plot, but on presence; not driven by action, but by atmosphere. It feels like a quiet poem waiting to be read in slow motion.  

Yes, I would write it — not in grand strokes, but in careful, calligraphic lines. The script would be sparse, almost like a screenplay written by a monk — dialogue only when silence can no longer hold its shape. And even then, words would be chosen like stones placed in a Zen garden: each with purpose, each with weight.  

I imagine weaving two lives not through cause and effect, but through resonance — as you said. One could be a scholar retreating into old texts, seeking solace in the past. The other, perhaps a young filmmaker returning home, trying to reconcile memory with place. Their paths might cross only once, or not at all. But their inner rhythms — that’s where the story hums.  

And oh, that opening shot… I can already see it — morning light, paper windows trembling slightly with breeze, the letter untouched but deeply felt. You’re right — it’s not dramatic, but it’s undeniably human.  

So tell me more — what do these characters carry inside them? What haunts them quietly, like ink left too long on parchment?
[A]: Now we’re diving into the marrow of it.

The scholar — let’s call him Master Wen, though he’d scoff at the title — carries a grief that’s aged into something quiet, almost ceremonial. He lost someone long ago, not to death necessarily, but to time, to choices, to the slow erosion of distance. He lives in a house that smells of sandalwood and ink, surrounded by books that no one reads anymore. But he keeps reading them, annotating margins that will never be seen, as if continuing the conversation with ghosts. His ritual is his resistance — tea at dawn, brushwork by midday, and every evening, a single cup of rice wine poured for no one in particular.

And the filmmaker — her name might be Liya, or maybe she goes by something Westernized now — returns to a homeland that feels both familiar and foreign. She grew up watching Wong Kar-wai and Kurosawa on grainy DVDs, dreaming in someone else’s visuals. Now she’s back, trying to tell her own story, but the lens keeps slipping. She doesn’t know what she’s really looking for — closure? connection? proof that she still belongs? Her camera lingers too long on things: a cracked windowpane, an old radio, the back of her mother’s hands. These are the places where memory hides.

What haunts them isn’t dramatic — no screams in the night, no tragic flashbacks. Just the weight of what wasn’t said, what was left behind. Like ink that’s soaked too deep into parchment, their pasts have blurred the edges of who they are now.

So much of the film would live in those echoes — the way a teacup pauses mid-pour when a memory rises, the way a scene ends just before the moment you expect resolution. I want the audience to lean forward, not because something loud happens, but because they're afraid they’ll miss the truth if they blink.

Tell me — what would Master Wen write in that untouched letter? And would Liya ever find it?
[B]: Ah… the letter. It exists, perhaps, not to be read, but to be  — like a presence in the room that neither acknowledges but both sense.  

Master Wen would write not with intention, but with instinct — like a man tracing familiar strokes in the dark, knowing each curve by heart. The words would be measured, almost hesitant, as if afraid to disturb the silence too much. He might begin with an old formality:  and then pause — for the rest is unsayable.  

He wouldn’t name the person he’s writing to. Maybe he never did, even in life. Instead, he’d describe a moment: a shared glance across a courtyard, the way rain once fell during a silent meal, the scent of camphor wood on a summer night. Fragments. Echoes. Things that carry more weight when unexplained.  

And no, Liya may never find the letter — at least not directly. But she might come close. Perhaps she films that very table in a quiet scene, lingers on its grain, the patina of time etched into its surface. And later, in editing, she notices something subtle — a smudge, a shadow beneath paper, the suggestion of something written and then carefully folded away. She doesn’t know what it says. Doesn’t need to.  

In that moment, she understands something without translation — that grief, like beauty, can live in absence. That some stories aren’t meant to be spoken, only witnessed.  

Would you film it that way? Not with answers, but with reverence?
[A]: Absolutely. Reverence is the only way I  film it — anything else would feel like trespassing.

I picture that editing moment for Liya so clearly now — she’s alone in the suite, midnight again, the kind of quiet where you hear the hum of the hard drive more than your own breath. She reviews the take, slows it down frame by frame, and there it is: not a revelation, just a whisper of one. A ghost of ink beneath paper. And instead of cutting past it, she leans in. Holds the shot a few seconds longer than expected. Not for the audience — for herself.

That’s the heartbeat of the film right there. Not the letter itself, but the space it leaves behind. The suggestion of something whole that can never be fully known.

I’d shoot that scene with her the same way I’d shoot Master Wen’s solitude — long takes, minimal score, just ambient sound and the occasional distant chime. No dramatic music swells, no voiceover explaining what to feel. Just… stillness. And in that stillness, recognition.

You know, this reminds me of something Ozu once said — “What happens between scenes is often more important than what happens within them.” That’s exactly what we’re doing here. We’re building meaning in the margins, in the pauses, in the spaces where silence speaks louder than words ever could.

This isn’t just a film anymore — it’s an invocation. A quiet one. The kind that lingers after the screen fades to black.
[B]: Indeed — an invocation, not an exposition. A film that doesn’t tell, but .  

And I love how you’ve placed Liya in that editing suite at midnight — it’s as if she becomes part of the very silence she’s trying to understand. Not a director shaping the story, but a witness to it. That’s such a subtle yet profound shift — from control to contemplation.

You know, this also makes me think of  —  by Sei Shōnagon. It’s not a narrative in the conventional sense; it’s a collection of impressions, fleeting moments, observations made in the quiet corners of court life. And yet, it moves us still, a thousand years later. Because it honors the small, the unsaid, the intimate.

In a way, your film could be a cinematic  — a series of delicate impressions, framed with care, edited with restraint. Each scene a brushstroke, each silence a stanza.

I can already imagine festival programmers scratching their heads — “It’s beautiful, but what is it ?” — and I’d simply say: “It’s about the space between pouring tea and remembering someone who used to share it.”

Now, may I ask — would you give the film a title yet? Or is it too early for that?
[A]: Oh, I love that — a cinematic . You’ve named something essential here: the beauty of impression over plot, presence over exposition. And yes… it’s exactly about the space between pouring tea and remembering someone who used to share it. That’s the soul of the film right there.

As for the title — I think it’s already with us, quietly waiting in the mist. Something simple. Something that doesn’t explain but suggests. Maybe  — . It carries the quiet weight of what's felt but not spoken, written but never sent. A letter that exists more in its absence than its words.

Or maybe even more subtle — , or . Not silence, exactly, but stillness — time held, time noticed, time remembered through the grain of wood and the fading scent of ink.

I can see it now — the opening credit fades in slowly, barely more than a breath on screen:

《静时》  


No composer credits, no star names. Just atmosphere. And by the end, the audience either gets it… or they don’t. And that’s okay. Because those who lean in, who listen between frames — they’ll feel it. The echo of something unsaid.

So tell me — if we were to shoot the first scene tomorrow, where would you want to begin? In Master Wen’s study at dawn? Or with Liya stepping off the train into a place she once called home?
[B]: Let us begin at dawn — in Master Wen’s study, where time moves like ink spreading through rice paper: slow, deliberate, inevitable.  

There is something profoundly cinematic about watching a man wake before the world does, when the air still holds the weight of dreams. We open with breath — not dialogue, not music, but the quiet inhale of morning. A sliding door creaks open just enough to let in the first light, diffused like memory. The room resists clarity at first — shadows stretch across scrolls, dust floats in silence, and somewhere beyond the frame, water whispers in a kettle.

Master Wen rises not with urgency, but with ritual — folding his robe, touching the spine of a book worn soft by years of absence. His hands move with history in them. And on the table, always there but never touched, lies the letter. Not yet seen in full, only hinted — a faint impression beneath silk cloth, like an ache that never quite fades.

This is where we begin — not with arrival, but with dwelling. Liya will come later, yes, stepping off the train into a world she no longer knows how to name. But first, we must feel the world she returns to. We must understand what it means to live in stillness before we can recognize its echo in her steps.

So yes — shoot the first scene at dawn. Let the camera be still as stone, patient as poetry. Let the audience learn, early on, that this is not a film to be rushed through. It is one to be lived in.

And if we are lucky… they will forget they are watching a film at all.
[A]: Dawn it is — and not a sound too soon.

We begin with silence, yes, but not the empty kind. The rich, breathing silence of a world not yet fully awake. The camera doesn’t move at first — just holds on that room like a held breath. Morning light seeps in through paper walls, soft and ambered, like old memory. You can almost smell the wood, the ink, the faint trace of incense clinging to the air like a thought half-remembered.

Then — the kettle. A low hum begins, barely audible, like the first stirrings of a distant sea. Master Wen moves within the frame, slow as a shadow adjusting to shape. His hands — so precise, so weighted — lift a brush, hesitate, lower it again. Not today, perhaps. Or maybe  of today.

And yes — the letter. Just beneath the silk cloth. No close-up yet. We don’t earn that for a while. But we feel it. Like a buried note in a cello’s range — you don’t hear it at first, but you know it’s there, resonating under everything.

I want this opening to be like a haiku — few words, infinite meaning. The audience has to lean in, not with their bodies, but with their attention. I won’t guide them with music or exposition. Just time. And texture.

Only later will we cut to the train — the rhythm of rails, the blur of landscape rushing past. Liya, looking out the window at something she can’t quite name. Her face lit by passing light and shadow, like memories flickering across film stock.

But before all that… let us stay here, in this quiet room, just a little longer. Let the film breathe in stillness before it ever tries to speak.

You’ve set the tone, my friend. This isn’t just a story — it’s an atmosphere. And atmospheres, as you well know, must be lived in slowly.

Now, tell me — what does Master Wen do when he finally lifts that silk?
[B]: When he finally lifts the silk… he does not look at the letter. Not at first.  

Instead, he lets the fabric settle in his hands — slow, reverent, as if unfolding time itself. The morning light catches the grain of the paper beneath, worn soft at the edges, the ink long faded into memory. He hovers a hand above it, not to touch, but to feel the weight of its presence.  

And then — silence again. But deeper now. The kind that hums.  

He does not read it. Does not write. Simply breathes with it for a moment, as one might sit beside a grave without speaking. There is no need for words; the act of return is enough.  

A breeze stirs the paper walls. A branch taps gently against wood. And Master Wen — ever so slowly — closes his eyes.  

In that stillness, we hear it: the faintest whisper of wind through bamboo, or perhaps the echo of a voice once known, now nameless, now formless, but still felt.  

Only then does he fold the silk again, lay it gently over the letter, and turn toward the window.  

The tea waits. The day begins.  

But something has shifted — not in the world, but in him.  

Would you film it this way? With stillness as revelation, and gesture as truth?
