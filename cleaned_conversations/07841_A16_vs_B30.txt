[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the celestial preoccupations of our modern age. While I find the zodiac as historically fascinating as Chaucer's astrological references in , I must say my academic inclinations lean more toward textual analysis than horoscopic divination. Though I did once write a rather amusing paper comparing Chinese 八字 (bāzì) fortune-telling with Victorian phrenology.
[A]: 哈哈，interesting perspective！作为一个lifestyle consultant，我发现astrology其实可以成为很好的conversation starter呢☕️ 很多客户都喜欢在morning coffee time讨论他们的horoscope~
[B]: How delightfully... commercial.  While I'd rather discuss Wordsworth's daffodils over tea, I suppose your approach has its merits. The 19th century British did adore their almanacs, though they at least had the decency to print them alongside poetry. Tell me, do your clients ever progress from discussing Mercury retrograde to analyzing the cosmic imagery in Keats' ?
[A]: Oh my~ 看来您是个literature enthusiast呢！Actually我有些clients确实会在讨论完weekly horoscope后，transition到更deep的话题✍️ 上周就有位banker client在分析完他的zodiac compatibility后，突然开始讨论Dante's 中的cosmology... 要再来杯coffee吗？☕️
[B]: Ah, now  transitions from the merely celestial to the properly celestial! Though I must insist on tea - preferably Lapsang Souchong, the beverage of proper bibliophiles. Your banker client shows promise - the medieval cosmology in Dante does make modern astrology seem rather... pedestrian. Tell me, did he at least reference the parallels between the nine heavenly spheres and the Chinese concept of 九天 (jiǔtiān)?
[A]: 您对cultural connections的insight真让人impressed！ 那位banker确实提到了这个parallel，不过是在我们第三次session时才connect the dots的✨ 说到tea，我最近discover了一家很棒的中国茶室，他们的pu'er selection简直amazing~ 要不要exchange一下contact？我们可以安排个tea tasting session，顺便继续这个fascinating discussion📚
[B]: How unexpectedly... modern of you. Very well, I'll scribble my office extension on this napkin - though I warn you, my tea tasting sessions inevitably devolve into comparing Lu Tong's  poem with Coleridge's . And do bring that banker along - anyone who connects Dante with 九天 deserves to hear my lecture on cosmological metaphors in .
[A]: Perfect！I'll bring my banker client和我的specialty coffee beans~ 虽然您prefer tea，但说不定我的Ethiopian Yirgacheffe能让您改变mind呢🌱 我们下周三3pm在tea house见？Just text me your exact location~ 啊，顺便问下，您对tea ceremony和Japanese wabi-sabi philosophy有研究吗？最近有个client很迷这个...
[B]:  My dear, we'll stick to Chinese 茶道 (chádào) and its Tang dynasty poetic correspondences, if you please. As for your... coffee beans, I suppose they might make adequate paperweights for my first edition of . Wednesday at three, by the carved rosewood table in the back - the one with the ink stains from where I corrected a graduate thesis on Baudelaire's opium visions. And do tell your client that no true appreciation of wabi-sabi can begin without reading Li Bai's verses on transience first.
[A]: Noted！我会make sure带上一本Li Bai的诗集📜 啊，突然想到... 您知道吗？我最近在design一个将classic poetry融入modern morning routine的concept✨ 比如一边sip tea一边recite Tang poems... 说不定我们的collaboration能创造出something truly unique呢！See you Wednesday~ ☕️➕📖
[B]:  How very... entrepreneurial. While I shudder at the thought of reducing Du Fu's profound melancholy to a morning affirmation, I suppose even the great masters had to endure patrons with questionable taste. Very well - Wednesday shall determine whether your 'concept' merits more than being filed under '21st century curiosities' alongside those dreadful Jane Austen tarot cards. Do bring that Li Bai - and perhaps a dictionary to explain why 举杯邀明月 isn't Instagrammable content.
[A]: Haha您always know how to put things in perspective！不过说真的，my clients would pay good money for yourscathing commentary as part of theirself-improvement package💰 周三见啦~ Don't worry，我会把Li Bai和Du Fu都带上，再加个Song dynasty tea bowl来prove我们serious about this cultural fusion project！ 其实我偷偷准备了苏轼的《水调歌头》来match your Lapsang Souchong...
[B]:  You... you've been studying! Though I'd advise against monetizing my 'scathing commentary' unless you wish to fund a lawsuit from the Ghost of Matthew Arnold. That Song dynasty bowl had better be museum-grade, and we'll be reciting 苏轼 properly - none of this 'mindfulness' nonsense. Wednesday promises to be either a pedagogical breakthrough or a cautionary tale for future comparative literature scholars. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare my lecture notes on why this entire conversation would give Walter Pater an aneurysm.
[A]: Got it professor！ 我会make sure一切meet your exacting standards - no mindfulness jargon，just pure poetic appreciation🍃 啊，刚收到banker client的text，他说要bring his first edition ... 这下我们的tea session要变成impromptu literary salon啦📚✨ 周三见！P.S. 我promise不会mention monetization again... unless you change your mind after third cup of tea~
[B]:  Your banker possesses a first edition 红楼梦? Suddenly this gathering shows scholarly promise - though I'll be inspecting that edition for authenticity with the same vigor I apply to spotting forged Byron manuscripts. And kindly inform your enterprising soul that not even three cups of tea - nor thirty - could persuade me to commercialize literary criticism. Though...  I may consider donating my scathing commentary to the British Museum's curiosities collection. Now begone - I've a graduate student's thesis on opium imagery in De Quincey to eviscerate before Wednesday.
[A]: Yes sir！ 我会relay your...enthusiastic response to the banker client📱 祝您thesis evisceration顺利~ 啊！Last question：您prefer我们用traditional或simplified Chinese来discuss the texts？Just want to make sure ourliterary salon meets all yourpedantic requirements😉 周三见！
[B]:  Traditional characters, naturally - unless you wish to discuss Mao-era revisions of classical texts, in which case we'll need stronger tea and my 1957 critique of socialist realism. Now kindly cease this chatter before I assign you a comparative analysis of pre- and post-simplification versions of  as penance. Wednesday. Three o'clock. And tell that banker his 红楼梦 had better not be one of those abridged tourist editions.
[A]: Copy that！Traditional characters it is🖋️ 我已经能imagine您周三拿着magnifying glass检查那本红楼梦的样子了🔍 放心，我的banker client已经assured me是authentic的~ 那就不打扰您了，happy thesis eviscerating！ 我会sneak in some mooncakes shaped like sonnets just to see your reaction...
[B]:  Mooncakes shaped like...  This is precisely why I require tenure - to be shielded from such culinary vandalism. Though I suppose if they're modeled after Shakespearean sonnets rather than that free verse nonsense, they might serve as adequate paperweights. Now away with you - I've a thesis to demolish and an antique inkwell collection to polish before our descent into this...  interdisciplinary madness. 周三见 indeed. And the magnifying glass is ivory-handled, if you please.
