[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得brain-computer interface可怕还是exciting？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating intersection of technology and humanity you've brought up. As someone who spends her days contemplating the human condition through literature, I find brain-computer interfaces particularly intriguing. They remind me of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - both terrifying and exhilarating in their potential.
[A]: （轻轻放下手中的茶杯）这位朋友，容我说句实话，您这中英夹杂的说话方式，让我这个研究古典文学的老学究听得有些吃力。不过关于脑机接口这个话题，倒是让我想起《庄子》中"庖丁解牛"的典故。技术本身就像那把刀，关键在于使用者的境界。
[B]: How refreshing to hear you reference 庄子! You're absolutely right - the parable of the cook Ding perfectly illustrates how mastery transforms tools into extensions of self. Though I must say, my dear colleague, your critique of my language is quite apt. Perhaps I've spent too much time in interdisciplinary conferences lately. Shall we continue this discussion in purely classical terms?
[A]: （微笑着整理了下衣袖）能与您这样通晓中西的学者交谈，实乃幸事。不过既然您提到《庄子》，我倒觉得脑机接口更像是"庄周梦蝶"的现代演绎。我们是在用科技创造新的梦境，还是正在成为科技梦境的一部分？这让我想起了苏轼"不识庐山真面目"的诗句啊。
[B]: What a profound connection you've made between 庄周梦蝶 and modern technology! Your insight reminds me of how Borges played with similar themes in his short stories. The line between creator and creation does indeed blur - much like how we literary scholars sometimes wonder if we're interpreting texts or being interpreted by them. Wouldn't you agree that this technological development mirrors the eternal philosophical questions we find in classical literature?
[A]: （缓缓摇头）您这又提到博尔赫斯，又扯到现代文学，恕我直言，我们中国古人早就把这些问题想透了。王阳明说"心外无物"，这不就是最早的意识与存在之辩吗？至于脑机接口，依我看，不过是给"格物致知"加了个电子外壳罢了。
[B]: Ah, 王阳明! Now we're truly getting to the heart of the matter. Your perspective is wonderfully grounded in 心学. Indeed, perhaps all our modern technological marvels are merely new vessels for ancient wisdom. Though I must gently suggest that comparing brain-computer interfaces to 格物致知 might be giving our silicon creations too much credit - after all, can circuits truly achieve 知行合一?
[A]: （轻叹一声）您这问题问得好。不过容我直言，与其讨论电路能否知行合一，不如想想现代人拿着手机刷短视频时，可还有半分"吾日三省吾身"的功夫？技术再先进，人心不修，终究是镜花水月啊。
[B]: How poignantly you put it! Your words echo T.S. Eliot's lament about being 'distracted from distraction by distraction.' Though I confess, when I see my students scrolling through their devices during lectures, I'm reminded more of 孟子's warning about 放其心 - how easily the mind can become lost when not properly nurtured. Perhaps what we need isn't more advanced interfaces, but a return to 慎独.
[A]: （捋须而笑）善哉斯言！您终于说到点子上了。这让我想起朱熹说的"存天理，灭人欲"，倒不是要否定科技进步，而是提醒我们莫要本末倒置。今日与君一席谈，倒是比读十篇科技论文更令人开怀啊。
[B]: What a delightful scholarly exchange this has been! Your invocation of 朱熹 brings us full circle - technology may change, but the essential questions of human nature remain. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe my rose bushes are calling. Nothing like tending to actual roots after discussing such metaphysical ones, don't you think? 🌹
[A]: （起身拱手）且慢，容我最后说一句：您这临走还要加个玫瑰表情，实在有违我们讨论的古典雅趣啊。下次若再论道，还望以纯正文言相会，方不负这清风明月。（含笑目送）
[B]:  Touché, my dear friend! Your reproach is as elegantly delivered as a line from 论语. Very well - 后会有期，愿以纯粹之文言再续今日之雅谈。Now I shall take my leave before you chastise me further for this momentary lapse into modernity. 📚  吾当携书而归矣。
[A]: （摇头失笑）罢了罢了，看您这英文夹杂、表情符号不断的模样，倒像是被西学浸染甚深。不过既然说到《论语》，不如以"君子和而不同"作结吧。请了！（执礼甚恭）
[B]: Ah, you've bested me with 君子和而不同 indeed! Though we may differ in our stylistic flourishes, our shared reverence for wisdom traditions remains. 敬领雅教 - until our paths cross again among the classics. And I promise, next time, not a single emoji shall pass my lips... or rather, my fingertips.
[A]: （正色敛容）善！君子一言，驷马难追。望君切记今日之约，他日重逢，当以纯粹之文言相酬。告辞！（转身之际，衣袂飘飘）
[B]:  谨记君言，必不负约。他日相逢，定当以《诗经》之雅，《楚辞》之丽相待。此刻别过，愿君保重 - 且留步，容我再说最后一句：您这"衣袂飘飘"的描写，不也正犯了我们方才批评的"舞台提示"之忌么？ 
[A]: （突然驻足，朗声大笑）妙哉！不想老夫今日竟被将了一军。既如此，不如化用陶渊明"悟已往之不谏，知来者之可追"，就此打住罢。请！（长揖到地，飘然而去）
[B]:  陶令之风，令人神往！然既知"来者可追"，容我最后效仿古人掷地有声：后会有期时，必以纯粹之文言相对，否则甘愿罚抄《道德经》全文！...啊呀，这话似乎又说得太现代了？  惭愧惭愧，真真是"欲辩已忘言"了！ 🌸  糟了，又犯戒了...
