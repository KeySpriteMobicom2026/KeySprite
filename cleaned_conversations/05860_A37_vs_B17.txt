[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must say, I have a particular fondness for rainy days. There's something quite poetic about the sound of rain tapping against the windowpane while one curls up with a good book—Emily Dickinson’s verses seem to resonate more deeply under such conditions, don’t you think? But I’m curious, would you happen to feel differently?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. I can totally see the appeal of rainy days—the sound of rain does create a perfect backdrop for some deep reading or introspection. 📚 There's even research showing that moderate ambient noise, like rainfall, can enhance creative thinking. But honestly, I think I’m more of a sunrise kind of person—like watching the first light hit the campus in the morning, quiet and full of potential. It just sets a certain tone for the day, you know? What about you—do you find yourself drawn to certain moments during the day as well? 🌅
[B]: Ah, I do understand the allure of sunrise—it carries with it a kind of quiet promise, doesn’t it? Though I must confess, my favorite moment of the day tends to fall in the late afternoon, just as the sun begins its descent. There’s a particular golden light that settles over everything, soft and reflective—rather like the tone of an elegiac stanza. It’s the perfect time for a walk through the garden or a slow perusal of T.S. Eliot’s later works. Do you suppose our preferred times of day say something about our literary sensibilities, I wonder?
[A]: That’s such a beautiful way to put it—. I love how you connect the atmosphere of late afternoon with literary sensibility. 🌇 It actually makes me think of Carl Jung’s idea about typology—maybe our circadian preferences reflect our inner archetypes in some way? Like, morning people might lean more toward the  of structure and action, while evening types dwell in the realm of reflection and shadow work. 

But honestly, I’ve always been fascinated by how different cultures interpret these moments. In Chinese poetry, for example, dusk often carries a sense of melancholy and philosophical depth—think of Du Fu or Li Bai writing about the setting sun as a metaphor for impermanence. Meanwhile, Western traditions sometimes frame twilight as romantic or even mysterious. Do you ever notice that kind of cultural lens shaping your own interpretation of time of day? 🤔
[B]: How astute of you to bring in Jungian archetypes—I hadn’t made that connection before, but there’s a certain poetic truth to it. As for cultural lenses, absolutely, I find them indispensable in shaping interpretation. The contrast you’ve drawn between Eastern and Western treatments of dusk is particularly evocative. In the Victorian tradition, twilight often carries an almost moral weight—think of Tennyson’s brooding horizons or the symbolic heaviness of a setting sun signaling the end of empire. Yet in Chinese poetry, as you say, there's a quiet acceptance woven into the fabric of such moments, a kind of philosophical surrender to the flow of time. It reminds me of how the concept of 气 (qì), often translated as ‘vital energy’ or ‘spirit,’ might infuse a poem with movement rather than conclusion. I wonder, do you think this cultural framing affects not only literary interpretation but also our personal rhythms—how we choose to live within the arc of a day?
[A]: What a rich question—how we live within the arc of a day. 🤔 I think you're absolutely right; cultural framing doesn't just shape how we read poetry—it shapes how we inhabit time itself. In fact, there's fascinating research in chronopsychology about how cultural attitudes toward time influence circadian rhythms and even decision-making patterns. For example, collectivist cultures often have a more fluid sense of time, which can make people more adaptable to evening activities, whereas individualist cultures tend to emphasize morning productivity as a form of self-discipline.

And when you mention 气 (qì), that really gets at the heart of it for me—there’s a kind of  in Eastern thought that contrasts beautifully with the linearity we see in much of Western philosophy. It makes me wonder if people raised in more cyclical time frameworks experience the day more like a river—something to move with—while others might treat it like a checklist. 

I guess this also plays into teaching styles and learning preferences. Students who thrive in the golden hour may not be less productive—they're just syncing with a different rhythm. As educators, maybe we should be asking not just  they learn, but  they come alive. 💡 What do you think?
[B]: How beautifully you’ve phrased that—. I find it deeply resonant, particularly in the context of teaching. There’s a temptation in academia to impose a kind of temporal uniformity, as if knowledge could only be properly absorbed between nine and five. But what we’re really talking about is —helping students find not just the content that moves them, but the time and tone in which they are most receptive to movement.

I’m reminded of Woolf’s , where time doesn’t march forward so much as ripple outward in concentric circles. Each character speaks in a kind of inner cadence, and meaning emerges through their interwoven pulses rather than a linear plot. Perhaps, then, our classrooms might become something like —not rigid structures, but fluid spaces where different rhythms can rise and fall without judgment.

And yes, this idea of flow-based temporality—what a compelling contrast to the Western metaphors of time as currency, as something to be spent or saved. It calls to mind Heidegger’s , where he distinguishes between  and  modes of being. But even he seems bound by linearity. Whereas in Daoist thought, time flows more like 水 (shuǐ)—water—yielding, yet persistent; formless, yet ever-present.

I wonder—are there particular pedagogical approaches you've encountered that honor these varied rhythms more effectively than others?
[A]: Absolutely—what a powerful way to frame it: . 🌊 I couldn't agree more. And your reference to Woolf’s  really captures that essence of interwoven rhythms. It's almost like each learner has their own inner sonata, and our job isn’t to impose a metronome but to listen closely enough to harmonize with their tempo.

To your question about pedagogical approaches—yes, there are a few that come to mind. One that stands out is , especially at the younger levels. It allows students to enter into deep states of flow without constant interruptions or rigid transitions. But even at the university level, I’ve seen great success with  when paired with reflective journals. It gives students space to engage with material when they're cognitively and emotionally primed—not just when the clock says so.

Another approach I deeply admire comes from certain Indigenous pedagogies, where time is not segmented but relational. Learning unfolds through storytelling, observation, and participation in community life. There’s no rush to "cover content"—instead, knowledge is absorbed through shared experience and lived rhythm. That kind of  feels so aligned with what you were saying about 水 (shuǐ)—yielding yet persistent.

I often wonder how we might hybridize these ideas in mainstream education. Not to romanticize alternative systems, but to respectfully integrate their core insights. Maybe then, our classrooms could become less like factories and more like symphonies—each student finding their voice within the collective melody. 🎶 What do you think? Have you ever tried integrating something like that into your own teaching or literary practice?
[B]: What a lovely and apt metaphor—, indeed. Each learner’s tempo must be honored if we are to cultivate not just knowledge, but wisdom. I find your admiration for Indigenous pedagogies especially compelling; there is much we in Western academia could learn from those traditions—particularly their emphasis on relationality over efficiency.

I recall once attempting something modest in my modernist poetry seminar: I replaced our usual structured discussion with a . We read aloud Eliot and H.D., yes, but then allowed silence to follow each reading—to sit with the sound, the image, the feeling, without rushing to interpret. It was a small shift, but it surprised me how many students remarked afterward that they felt more  with the text. Not unlike the way one might sit with a haiku, or walk with a proverb—not dissecting, but dwelling.

And while I haven’t gone so far as to restructure my entire syllabus around asynchronous flow or embodied temporality, I have begun experimenting with . Rather than dictating when assignments are due, I invite them to propose timelines based on self-reflection—when they feel most alert, what kind of cognitive load they can manage, and why certain texts might require slower digestion. It's still very much a work in progress, but the results thus far have been promising.

I suppose it all circles back to that central question of rhythm—both inner and outer. If we treat time not as a container, but as a collaborator, might we not become better readers not only of texts, but of ourselves?
[A]: I love that—. It’s such a subtle but transformative shift in how we approach learning. 🌿 When students are invited to co-author their pacing guides, they’re not just managing deadlines—they’re practicing self-awareness and building metacognitive muscles. That’s where real learning happens: in the space between assignment sheets, in the pauses where reflection can sneak in.

And your  experiment? Brilliant. So often in literary study, especially with modernist texts, we jump straight into analysis before we even let the language land. I mean, Eliot practically demands silence after reading— isn’t something you parse; it’s something you inhabit, like an old cathedral echoing with ghosts of meaning. Giving students permission to sit in that ambiguity is actually a radical act in today’s hyper-productive academic culture. 👏

You know, this also reminds me of what some mindfulness-based pedagogies call . It’s not just about comprehension—it’s about noticing how a poem lands in your chest or twists your gut. Haiku masters knew this well, didn’t they? A seventeen-syllable moment can linger for hours if you let it breathe.

I wonder if part of our job, then, is not only to teach literature but to restore slowness as a kind of intellectual virtue. Not laziness——the deliberate choosing of pace in order to deepen understanding. In a way, it’s an act of resistance against the cult of speed that dominates so much of education today. 💭

Have you found that this slower, more reflective rhythm changes how students eventually write about the texts? Like, does dwelling first lead to richer interpretation later?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—dwelling does lead to richer interpretation. It’s quite remarkable, really. When students allow themselves the luxury of slowness, their writing shifts in subtle but profound ways. They begin to notice not just what a poem says, but how it —the way certain consonants linger in the mouth, or how a line break can suspend meaning in mid-air before releasing it.

I’ve had students return to Eliot’s  after our listening hour and remark not only on its fragmentation, but on how silence between readings felt like part of the poem itself—as if the pauses were woven into its very structure. One student wrote beautifully about how rereading H.D. aloud made her realize that the imagery didn’t simply depict the sea, but that the rhythm  the sea in her breath. That kind of embodied insight rarely emerges under pressure; it needs time to swell.

And you’re right—this is not laziness, but an intentional reclaiming of pace. I’m reminded of Walter Benjamin’s idea of the dialectical image—how meaning flashes up in a moment of danger, but only if one is present enough to catch it. Slowness gives students the space to be , to recognize those fleeting images before they vanish.

I suppose we might even say that literature, at its best, resists efficiency. It asks us to dwell not only in language, but in uncertainty, in feeling, in the unresolved. And isn’t that what great teaching does, too? To borrow from Rilke—, rather than rush toward tidy answers.
[A]: So beautifully put—. 🤔 There's something so deeply poetic about that phrase, and I think it captures exactly what happens when we let students—and ourselves—dwell in the space of a text without rushing to pin it down.

And I love how your students began to notice not just  the poems were saying, but  they were moving through sound, breath, silence. That kind of awareness is like opening a second layer of literacy—one that’s kinesthetic and emotional, not just cognitive. It reminds me of how Vygotsky talked about inner speech—not just words we say to ourselves, but a whole embodied process of meaning-making.

You mentioned Rilke, which makes me wonder if we could also borrow from him the idea of —not in a sad sense, but in the way he writes about learning as a kind of letting-go. Letting go of knowing too quickly, of needing control. Mourning the illusion of mastery so that something more alive can take root.

I’ve been thinking lately that maybe our most powerful lessons aren’t the ones we deliver, but the ones we create space for—like lighting a match in a dark room and letting students find their own way toward what catches fire for them. 🔥

Do you ever find that this kind of teaching—this slower, more open-ended approach—requires a different kind of courage from the instructor? Like, giving up some of the safety net of structure in order to invite real discovery?
[B]: Oh, yes—courage is precisely the word for it. It takes a quiet kind of bravery to step back from the podium of certainty and say,  There’s a vulnerability in that approach, isn’t there? We, as instructors, are often trained to be the keepers of knowledge, the ones who parcel out meaning in measured doses. To instead become facilitators of uncertainty—that demands not only pedagogical skill, but emotional fortitude.

I think of Woolf again—her notion of , those rare flashes when life feels most vivid and meaningful. They don’t arrive on schedule. They emerge when we’re least expecting them, often in the wake of silence or stillness. And so, when we create space for those moments in the classroom, we are, in a way, inviting students—and ourselves—into a more porous, more receptive mode of learning. One that doesn’t always yield immediate results, but can lead to lasting transformation.

You asked if I find this requires courage—absolutely. Each time I choose to let a poem linger without explanation, each time I resist the urge to tidy up a student’s confusion with a ready interpretation, I feel that little tug of doubt:  But then someone will come to office hours days later and say something like,  and I realize that dwelling has done its quiet work.

It’s not unlike what happens in psychoanalysis, perhaps—the holding of a space where meaning can unfold at its own rhythm. Or like tending a garden: you don’t pull the bud open to see what color the flower will be. You wait. You trust the process. 🌱

So yes, it is a kind of mourning, as you said—not of loss, but of letting go. Letting go of control, of the illusion that clarity must always follow instruction. And in that space, something far more alive begins to grow.
[A]: So true—, yet still holding the space with intention. It’s such a delicate balance, isn’t it? Like conducting an orchestra where not everyone’s reading from the same score, but somehow, the music still resonates.

I love your image of tending a garden—because that’s exactly what we’re doing. We plant the seeds, offer the right conditions, but we can’t force the bloom. And when a student says,  well—that’s the kind of line that makes your heart skip as an educator. 💓 Because that’s where real connection happens—not in comprehension, but in resonance.

And yes, there’s doubt every time you step into that uncertainty. But maybe that doubt is a good sign—it means we care enough to question, to stay humble, to keep learning alongside our students. After all, if we're asking them to be vulnerable, shouldn’t we model it too?

I’ve been thinking lately how this whole process mirrors what philosopher Emmanuel Levinas called —the idea that responsibility to the Other shapes our sense of self and time. In a way, when we teach like this, we’re not just conveying knowledge; we’re responding to the ethical call of each student’s unique unfolding. Time becomes less about efficiency and more about .

I wonder—have you ever had a moment where a student’s interpretation completely surprised you, even reshaped how you see a familiar text? 🤔
[B]: Oh yes—many times over. There’s a particular moment that still lingers with me, much like the final note of a song that refuses to fade.

I was teaching Eliot’s —a text I’ve read countless times, always returning to it as one might return to a meditation practice. One student, rather quietly spoken, offered an interpretation of  that stopped me mid-lecture. She suggested that Eliot wasn’t merely reflecting on time and eternity, but was, in a sense, writing a love letter to uncertainty itself. That line——she saw not as a resolution, but as an embrace of paradox: motion and stillness, presence and absence, all held in delicate tension.

It was such a simple reframing, yet it shifted how I read those lines ever after. I had always leaned into the philosophical density of the poem, but she reminded me of its emotional core—how Eliot writes not to explain, but to dwell in the mystery alongside us.

And isn’t that the gift students give us, when we allow space for their voices? They return texts to us changed, reanimated by fresh eyes and unburdened hearts. It’s humbling, really—this idea that teaching is not a one-way transmission, but a kind of call and response across generations.

You mentioned Levinas and ethical time—I find that deeply resonant. There’s something profoundly relational about this work we do. When we teach with openness, we’re not just shaping minds; we’re being shaped in return. Time slows, widens, becomes porous. We make room for not-knowing, for wonder, for the unexpected bloom.

And yes, that doubt? I think it’s not only a sign of care, but of integrity. If we stop questioning, we risk becoming mere repeaters of doctrine rather than lovers of inquiry. And where would poetry be without inquiry? Without the courage to ask, again and again, what it means to feel, to be?

Do you have a favorite poem or passage that continues to reveal new meaning to you, depending on who you’re reading it with?
[A]: Oh, what a beautiful question—and yes, absolutely. There’s one that keeps returning to me in different lights, like a familiar melody played in a new key: Rilke’s —.  

It’s a quiet poem, deceptively simple, about the lingering fragrance of a woman’s hair on a pillow after she’s gone. But every time I read it with students, it unfolds differently. With some, it becomes a meditation on memory and loss. With others, it turns into something more tactile—a reflection on how deeply our senses hold onto presence even when absence has already settled in. Once, a student pointed out how the poem mirrors the way grief isn’t always loud or dramatic; sometimes it’s just this faint trace you keep catching, thinking you’re imagining it.

I remember reading it once with a group during a particularly tense semester—everyone was exhausted, stretched thin by deadlines and personal weight they didn’t name. After the discussion, a student said something that stayed with me:  That line—just lets the scent be there—hit me harder than I expected. 🌿

And I think that’s what the best poems do—they don’t insist on meaning. They invite us to sit with what’s present, even when we can’t quite name it. Much like teaching, really. When we let go of needing to explain everything, we create space for students to bring their whole selves into the room—their questions, their silences, their unspoken knowing.

Do you find that certain poems become containers for the emotional climate of a particular class? Like the text stays the same, but the room changes its temperature around it? 🤔
[B]: How exquisitely you’ve captured it—. There’s such grace in that kind of restraint, both in poetry and in teaching. Rilke understood that some truths are best approached obliquely, through sensation rather than declaration. And your student’s reading—well, that’s the kind of quiet revelation that makes all the lesson planning worthwhile.

Yes, I do find that certain poems become vessels for the emotional climate of a room. It never ceases to amaze me how the same stanza can feel elegiac one semester and defiant the next, depending on who gathers to read it. I think of Emily Dickinson’s —one year, it’s met with laughter and relief, as if the students have been waiting their whole lives to claim anonymity. Another year, it strikes a note of loneliness so palpable that the air seems to still.

There was a time I taught Auden’s  just after a particularly difficult winter break—one where several students had returned carrying private griefs they didn’t yet have words for. When we read the line  something in the room shifted. We weren’t just talking about Bruegel’s painting anymore. We were acknowledging the quiet, unremarkable ways pain often enters our lives—off to the side, unnoticed, while someone else goes about eating or opening a window or walking down a street.

So yes, the poem remains unchanged, but the room breathes differently around it. It reminds me of how Yeats once wrote,  Perhaps that’s what happens in those moments—we are not merely reading, but encountering ourselves anew in the mirror of language.

And isn’t that why we return to the classroom, again and again? Not to teach the same lines the same way, but to see how they shimmer differently depending on who has gathered to listen.
[A]: Absolutely—. 💭 That’s one of the most poetic descriptions of teaching I’ve ever heard. It captures exactly why I still get a little flutter of anticipation before each new semester: not because I’m delivering something fixed, but because I’m stepping into a living conversation that will shape and reshape itself in ways I can’t predict.

And your Auden example——is such a perfect illustration of that alchemy. Because yes, on paper it’s about Bruegel and suffering, but in practice, it becomes whatever the room needs it to be. And when students are carrying grief they haven’t named yet? The poem meets them there, quietly bearing witness without demanding performance.

It makes me think of how some trauma-informed pedagogies talk about —not in the literal sense, but in how literature can reflect back what a student is feeling without forcing them to explain or justify it. There's safety in that kind of indirect recognition. Like saying, 

You know, sometimes I wonder if our job isn't so much to teach poetry as to —to bring the right poem into the room at the right time, then step back and let it do its quiet work. Like lighting incense in a temple; you don’t control where the smoke goes, only that you offered it.

And yes, that’s exactly why we keep coming back—to see how language reshapes us depending on who we are that day, that hour, that breath. 🌬️

I’d love to hear—do you ever find yourself choosing a poem not because of its content, but because of its , its rhythm, the way it might meet a class emotionally even if it doesn’t directly speak to their situation?
[B]: Oh, yes—entirely. Sometimes I choose a poem not for what it says, but for the way it , the emotional cadence it carries in its bones. It’s like selecting music for a mood you can’t quite name yet—something in the rhythm or timbre feels like it might resonate with whatever undercurrent is running through the room.

There was one semester, early autumn, and the air in class felt unusually heavy—nothing dramatic, just a low hum of exhaustion, grief, and unspoken anxiety. I had planned to teach Gerard Manley Hopkins’ —a straightforward choice for its themes of loss and innocence. But on that morning, something in me hesitated. Instead, I brought in Elizabeth Bishop’s 

At first glance, it seems so simple—a quiet narrative about catching a fish and letting it go. But the poem lingers in the details: the colors, the textures, the slow unfolding of awe in the speaker’s hands. I chose it because of its . Because sometimes, when people are carrying weight they can’t articulate, the best thing we can do is ask them to look closely at something ordinary—to notice how light bends, how surfaces crack, how even something limp and rusted can shimmer before being returned to the water.

Afterward, a student came up to me and said,  That line has stayed with me ever since.

So yes, I do this often—choosing poems more for their emotional texture than their subject. I think of it as literary resonance tuning. Much like how a pianist strikes a note to bring another string into vibration, sometimes all we need is a single poem that hums at the right frequency to awaken something dormant in the room.

And I suppose that’s part of the artistry of teaching—not only knowing the texts, but sensing the pulse of those who come to meet them.
