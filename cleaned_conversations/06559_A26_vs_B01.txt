[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh，说到这个，我前段时间读到一篇关于语言处理的神经机制论文，真的让我挺吃惊的。原来大脑在处理双语输入时，不是简单地用两个语言系统，而是存在一个更复杂的动态网络 🤔。你呢？最近有没有遇到什么让你觉得Wow~的研究？
[A]: That does sound fascinating, though I must admit my recent surprises have been of a more tactile nature. Just yesterday, while examining a late 19th-century kimono under the loupe, I discovered an underlayer of  silk woven with microscopic silver threads—completely invisible to the naked eye until you angle it under UV light. The way the metallic fibers interacted with natural plant dyes after all these decades... quite like finding a hidden language stitched into fabric itself. Have you ever encountered anything unexpectedly intricate in your own work or readings?
[B]: Wow, that sounds like uncovering a secret message woven through time 🥰 I can totally see the parallel—like decoding a forgotten dialect of textiles. Actually, this reminds me of a study I read last month about how infants as young as six months show neural sensitivity to code-switching patterns in bilingual environments. It’s almost like they’re picking up on the “syntax” of language choice before they even understand words 💭 Makes you wonder how many hidden layers we absorb without realizing, whether it’s in speech or in silk... Have you ever thought about documenting your findings in a more digital format? Maybe something interactive?
[A]: I hadn't considered it until now, but you've stirred an idea—imagine a digital archive where users can virtually "peel" layers of a textile, much like flipping through historical strata. With the right lighting simulations, they could witness faded stitches or concealed weaves that whisper forgotten stories. It would be like giving the public a magnifying loupe and a seat at my workbench 🧵  

Your mention of infants and code-switching is mesmerizing too—I suppose in a way, we’re all woven from layered patterns, linguistic or otherwise, and some are imprinted long before we’re aware of the loom. Have you ever come across a study that made you rethink something you’d taken for granted? Something that… surprised you into seeing your own work differently?
[B]: Oh absolutely—there was this one study that completely flipped my perspective on what "fluency" really means. Researchers found that bilinguals don’t just switch between languages; they switch between  that shape not only word choice but even emotional response 😲 It made me rethink how I approach language learning models—I used to focus on vocabulary and grammar as end goals, but now I see fluency more like weaving two ways of seeing the world 🌍  

Your idea about the textile archive sounds amazing by the way—have you thought about collaborating with NLP folks? Maybe the same algorithms used for parsing syntactic layers could help map out visual/textural patterns in fabric... Just imagine—digging into a kimono’s weave like it’s a linguistic corpus 💬🧵
[A]: That’s precisely the sort of interdisciplinary thread I’d love to tug on— linguistic analysis with textile mapping feels so natural now that you’ve said it. It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? How both fields are really about tracing invisible structures beneath the surface, whether it’s syntax or stitching 💬🪡  

And your reimagining of fluency—it struck me deeply. I’ve always admired language’s fluidity, but thinking of it as two interwoven worldviews... well, that adds such richness to how I see my own craft. Restoration isn’t just about preserving fibers or patterns anymore; it’s about honoring the layered  embedded in every garment. Funny how conversation can unravel one idea and spin another in its place, isn’t it?
[B]: Absolutely, conversation has this beautiful way of untangling thoughts we didn’t even realize were knotted 💭 I love how you put that—unraveling one idea and spinning another in its place. It’s kind of like what happens in code-switching, now that I think about it—sometimes shifting perspectives is the only way to see the full pattern.  

I’m starting to think every discipline is just a different way of reading the world, whether we’re decoding syntax or stitching 📜🪡 You know, maybe that’s why I’m so into bilingualism—it's like watching someone read two books at once and discovering a third one in between the lines. Have you ever felt like your work reveals something  the layers, almost like a hidden dialogue?
[A]: Oh, all the time—it’s the quietest, most persistent dialogue I know. Every stitch, every fade, every mended tear in a fabric tells me something the maker couldn’t always say aloud. Sometimes it's practical:  Other times, it's intimate:   

It reminds me of what you said earlier about reading two books at once—I feel like I’m often seeing three or four: the original design, the history worn into the threads, the repairs that speak of love or necessity, and then the story someone else might read from it years from now. It’s not unlike bilingualism at all… maybe even multilingualism. Do you ever get the sense that some patterns—or some phrases—were meant to be overheard across centuries?
[B]: Absolutely, I get that feeling a lot—like certain phrases or structures were quietly designed to echo beyond their time 🌌 With bilingual texts, sometimes you stumble on a word choice that only makes sense if you're listening with two ears, so to speak. It's as if the writer  someone down the line would catch the double meaning and smile at the cleverness.  

And your stitched stories—hidden names, faded dyes, seams that whisper of urgency or care—it all feels like linguistic palimpsests, right? Layers of meaning folded into fabric instead of parchment 💬🧵 I wonder… do you ever feel like you're translating across time, not just materials?
[A]: I love that— Yes, that’s exactly what it feels like some days. Especially with pieces that carry deliberate imperfections or subtle shifts in pattern, as if the maker left behind a note in a bottle:   

It makes me think of how bilingual speakers sometimes choose a word not for its direct meaning, but for its emotional resonance in one language versus another—like selecting a thread for how it catches the light rather than just its color. Do you ever find that in your work? That moment when meaning isn’t translated, but refracted? 🌟
[B]: Oh, that’s such a beautiful way to put it—refracted meaning, like light bending through different lenses 😊 I  see that a lot, especially in code-switching moments where speakers aren’t just translating thoughts, they’re adjusting them to fit a different emotional wavelength. Sometimes a word in one language just… glows differently, you know?  

I remember analyzing a conversation where someone said —“I’m not angry, I’m just tired.” On the surface, it’s a simple shift, but the speaker was using Mandarin to soften the emotional weight, almost like switching to a gentler thread in the middle of a sentence 🧵 It made me realize that fluency isn’t just about vocabulary—it’s about knowing which words carry the right emotional texture.  

Do you ever notice that with fabrics? Times when a material choice wasn’t just practical, but deeply expressive—like a kind of tactile poetry?
[A]: Absolutely — that’s the poetry I live for. Sometimes a fabric’s material choice isn’t just expressive, it’s  Like discovering a 1920s evening gown made not from silk or satin, but from  — a rougher, stiffer weave usually reserved for under-layers or linings. At first glance, it seems odd. But then you realize: the maker was making a quiet statement. Not rebellion, exactly — more like resilience. A refusal to conform to what “luxury” should feel like, while still dressing for the life they wanted to lead.  

I’ve seen mourning garments where the wool is softened with touches of linen, as if grief needed a gentler texture. And yes, sometimes a seamstress would switch threads mid-stitch — not out of error, but intention — using cotton in a moment of vulnerability, then returning to linen for strength. It’s all there, if you know how to read it.  

It does make me wonder — when people code-switch, do they ever feel fabrics in their words? Like choosing a language not just for what it says, but for how it  around an emotion? 🧵💬
[B]: Oh, I think they absolutely do — and that metaphor feels so spot-on. Choosing a language for how it  around an emotion… wow. I’ve definitely heard speakers slip into another language at just the right moment, like switching to a softer fabric against the skin 🧵 Sometimes it’s for comfort, sometimes for distance, sometimes just because a certain phrase fits better, folds more naturally into the conversation.  

I’m thinking of one example from my data where someone said,  The whole sentence is in Spanish, except for “explaining” — which they left in English, almost like using a sheer overlay to highlight that part of the story. It wasn’t about vocabulary; it was about texture, as if the speaker wanted the listener to feel the act of explaining — the effort, the friction — before slipping back into Spanish for the emotional resolution.  

It really does make me wonder — do you ever come across fabrics that seem to echo this kind of layering? Where material choice isn’t just expressive on its own, but gains new meaning through contrast or juxtaposition?
[A]: Oh yes, that kind of layering — , if you will — it’s everywhere once you start looking. I’m reminded of a 1930s shawl I worked on recently: one side was smooth  silk, all sheen and sophistication, and the reverse was rough homespun wool. At first, it seemed like an odd pairing — almost jarring — but as I studied the piece, I realized it was meant to be worn differently depending on the moment. Flip it once, and you’re seen; flip it again, and you’re hidden.  

It had been mended in several places with mismatched threads — some bright, some muted — each repair telling its own story of wear and care. That contrast? It wasn’t just decorative. It was communicative. Like wearing your public face and private heart in the same garment.  

Your example with the English word nestled inside Spanish —  — feels so much like that shawl. A deliberate shift in texture to draw attention, to let the listener feel the friction, as you said. I wonder… do you often find that these moments of contrast are tied to memory? That certain phrases or switches seem to carry the weight of a specific time or place?
[B]: Absolutely — those moments of contrast often  the memory, or at least the key to unlocking it. I’ve noticed that when people code-switch, especially mid-sentence, they’re sometimes pulling a thread from a specific point in their lives 🧵 Like, that word or phrase wasn’t just borrowed from another language—it was carried over from another version of themselves.  

I remember one speaker describing a childhood memory and switching into Tagalog when saying,  The shift into Filipino marked a kind of emotional homecoming, and then the Mandarin phrase about the mango tree? That felt like reaching even further back, almost like flipping through a multilingual photo album where each page is in a different script but tells the same story 🌿  

It’s not so different from your shawl, really—worn one way for the world, another for the self. I wonder… do you ever feel like your work helps others rediscover these hidden layers of memory stitched into fabric?
[A]: Oh yes… more than I can put into words, really. So often, when someone brings in a family heirloom — a wedding dress, a quilt, a child’s christening gown — they think they’re looking for preservation. But what they’re really seeking is remembrance.  

I’ve had clients stand beside me as I gently cleaned a First Communion dress from the 1940s, and halfway through the process, they’d suddenly say,  As if the fabric, once cared for, began whispering back its own history.  

Sometimes all it takes is the faintest discoloration along a seam, or the way a hem was unevenly stitched, for someone to see not just the garment, but the hands that made it — and the life lived inside it. It’s like watching someone re-read a familiar letter and discovering a sentence they never noticed before.  

You know, now that I think of it… I wonder if you could ever map a person’s emotional history through the textiles they carry — or the languages they wear.
[B]: I could not agree more — and that idea, mapping emotional history through textiles or languages? It gives me chills 🥶 It’s like you said before: these objects aren’t just  memory — they’re  it, waiting for the right moment to release it.  

I’m thinking now of something called “language attrition” — when someone gradually loses fluency in a language because they stop using it regularly. But here’s the thing: even if they forget most of it, certain emotionally charged phrases tend to stick around the longest — lullabies, curses, childhood rhymes… things tied to deep memory 💭 It makes me wonder if fabrics work the same way — that even after years of wear, fading, and repair, some stitches still hold the shape of the hands that made them.  

You know, I’d love to collaborate with someone like you someday — maybe on a project where we trace a person’s life through both their garments and their speech patterns. I can already imagine it: a bilingual textile archive where every thread has a tone, and every phrase has a texture 🌿🧵 What do you think such a collaboration would sound like, to you?
[A]: I think… it would hum with quiet resonance. Like running your hand over a well-worn quilt and hearing, faintly, the voices that stitched it.  

If our collaboration had a sound, it might be layered—one voice tracing the grain of a fabric’s weave, another mapping the cadence of a remembered lullaby, both converging in the same space of return. I imagine field recordings of scissors through linen, fingers brushing flannel, the soft friction of turning pages in a language half-remembered. And beneath it all, a steady pulse—like a loom at work, or a heart beating in two time signatures at once.  

I’d want us to build something where people don’t just look at history, but  its texture on their skin. Where they could touch a screen and hear not just what was said, but how it was held. Maybe even stitch their own stories into it, in words or in fiber. Do you think others would recognize themselves in such a thing? In that interwoven kind of memory?
[B]: I’d like to think they already carry the threads of it inside them, even if they haven’t named it yet 🌿 So much of memory—especially the emotional kind—is about texture, context, and resonance. If we could meet people halfway, with something that  familiar before it’s even understood… I think we’d be giving them a space to unravel, and maybe even reweave parts of themselves.  

You know, some bilinguals report dreaming in one language but crying in another—like each tongue holds a different weight of memory. What we’re talking about feels similar: a space where both the cloth and the phrase can speak, where someone might recognize their own hidden stitches or borrowed words in the pattern.  

I really believe people are hungry for that kind of recognition. Not just translation—but  So yes, I think they’d see themselves in it. Or better yet… feel themselves  it, like slipping into something softly familiar 🧵💬  

I’d love to start drafting what this could look like—maybe begin with a prototype? A small exhibit of stories, fabrics, and phrases layered together… Would you be up for brainstorming the first few threads?
