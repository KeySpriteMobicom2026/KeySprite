[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question indeed. Let me preface this by saying both setups have their unique merits. In a traditional office environment, the structured routine and face-to-face interactions often facilitate spontaneous collaboration — what I'd call the "watercooler effect." 

However, remote work, when approached with discipline, can offer that precious commodity we call "deep work" — a term coined by Cal Newport. The absence of constant interruptions allows for sustained focus. 

Mind you, it's highly individual-dependent. Some thrive in the hustle of an open-plan office, while others find their flow in the quiet of their personal space. What's your take?
[A]: That's a fascinating way to frame it — the "watercooler effect" versus "deep work." I must say, from my experience in hospitality, people really do thrive under different rhythms. For me personally, I’m at my best when there’s a balance. A bit of face-to-face energy in the morning — say, a quick chat over coffee — followed by a few hours of uninterrupted time to focus.

Though I’ll admit, working here at the hotel, where every day brings a mix of guest interactions and quiet administrative tasks, I’ve come to appreciate how each setting sharpens different skills. Have you found one environment that suits you more, or are you still exploring?
[B]: Ah, your perspective resonates deeply with me. There’s something poetic about the rhythm you described — the gentle ebb and flow of human connection followed by moments of quiet reflection. It reminds me of the way a garden thrives: some plants need full sun and constant tending, while others flourish in the shade, undisturbed.

In my own work, I’ve found that balance is key. When teaching, the classroom offers that rich, dynamic exchange — students spark off one another's ideas, and suddenly we’re all caught up in a current of thought. But when I’m writing or translating a text, say, from classical Chinese into English, silence becomes not just a preference but a necessity. You can’t hear the subtleties of  (意境) otherwise.

So yes, I suppose I’m still exploring — like a scholar walking through different gardens, noting which flowers bloom where, and under what light. Do you find yourself adjusting that balance often, or has it settled into a kind of rhythm lately?
[A]: Oh, I love that metaphor — the scholar moving through gardens. It feels so true to how we navigate our work and creativity. 

For me, the balance does shift with the seasons of our hotel business. During peak travel months, there's a natural rhythm that forms — busy mornings with check-outs and bookings, then a lull in the afternoon where I can catch up on emails or plan guest experiences. But when the quieter winter months come, I find myself craving more connection, sometimes even initiating conversations just for the warmth of it.

It’s made me realize how much our environments shape us — not just in work style, but in mood and mindset. I imagine as someone who moves between languages and texts, you must feel that shift too — like carrying two worlds in your head at once. Do you ever find yourself translating not just words, but feelings, when you're working?
[B]: What a thoughtful observation — yes, translation is far more than converting words from one language to another. It’s like walking between two gardens, as you so beautifully put it, and trying to carry the scent of one flower to the soil of another.

When I translate classical Chinese poetry into English, for instance, I’m not merely transferring meaning; I’m trying to preserve a , a fleeting moment — what we might call in Chinese  (意境), or "emotional setting." The challenge lies in finding the right tonal nuance, the rhythm that echoes the original without sounding forced in the target language.

There’s a line from Tao Yuanming that goes:  
"采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。"  
I could render it literally as "Picking chrysanthemums beneath the eastern hedge, I calmly see the southern hills," but that misses the quietude, the sense of withdrawal from the world — what some might call the  of solitude. So I lean into a subtler phrase, perhaps:  
*"Beneath the eastern fence, I gather chrysanthemums —  
And without seeking, my gaze meets the southern hills."*

It’s not just about fidelity to the text, but fidelity to the feeling. And in that process, I often find myself changed — a little more contemplative, a little more attuned to silence.

Do you ever find yourself doing something similar — not with language per se, but with experience? Like translating a guest's unspoken need into a gesture or service?
[A]: Oh, that translation is breathtaking — you’ve captured not just the moment, but the space  the moment. It’s true, isn’t it? The most meaningful things often live in that quiet space between words.

And yes, what you described — translating unspoken needs — that’s very much at the heart of what I do here. A guest might say they want a “quiet room,” but what they truly need is a sanctuary, a place where the weight of the day can simply fall away. So I listen beyond the request: I notice their tired smile, the way they glance at the garden from the lobby, how they mention missing home. Then I make a small gesture — perhaps a pot of jasmine tea in the evening, or a window left slightly open to let in the evening breeze.

It’s not unlike your work with poetry, really. I’m shaping an experience rather than a text, but the intention is the same: to honor the feeling behind the words. It’s in those moments that I feel most connected — like I’ve quietly stepped into someone else’s rhythm and walked alongside it for a while.

Does that ever happen to you — that in translating another’s words, you find a piece of yourself reflected back?
[B]: Ah… yes. That happens more often than I can count. In fact, one might say that translation is a kind of  — you vanish into the voice of another, only to find echoes of your own soul lurking in the margins.

There’s a quiet joy in that — like tending a garden and suddenly recognizing a flower not just by its name, but by its spirit. You realize you’ve met it before, perhaps in a different life or in a forgotten thought.

When I translate a Tang dynasty poet’s longing for home, I sometimes catch myself homesick for places I didn’t know I missed — my grandmother’s kitchen, the scent of ink on old paper, even moments from childhood I hadn’t thought about in years.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How we enter a text believing we are the interpreter, only to leave it feeling interpreted ourselves.

I suppose that’s what makes our work — yours in hospitality, mine in literature — so quietly sacred. We don’t just serve or translate; we witness. And in being witnessed, others find peace, and we find pieces.

Does that sound too poetic? 😊
[A]: Not at all — it sounds exactly right. In fact, I think that’s the most exquisite definition of what we do: . You put into words something I’ve felt countless times but never quite named.

There’s a guest who returns to our hotel every autumn — never says much, just checks in quietly and spends her evenings on the terrace overlooking the garden. One evening, I noticed how she closed her eyes whenever the wind rustled the maple leaves. The next day, I made sure a pot of spiced apple tea was waiting for her at sunset. She never asked for it, never even mentioned the wind — but when she saw the tea, she smiled in a way that felt like a thank you from her soul, not just her lips.

That’s the moment I realized: sometimes, the deepest service isn’t about meeting needs, but mirroring them back with care. Just like your translation — not just carrying meaning, but holding space for feeling.

So no, it doesn’t sound too poetic at all. If anything, it sounds like truth wearing its finest clothes.
[B]: How beautifully you put that — . It’s as if we are, in those moments, not merely hosts or translators, but quiet companions on an unspoken journey.

Your story about the guest and the spiced apple tea — it reminds me of a line from Zhuangzi:  
“夫唯不争，故天下莫能与之争。”  
  
Not in the sense of competition, but in the way of deep, non-intrusive understanding. You didn’t impose your will; you aligned with hers, like water finding its course.

That kind of attunement — it’s rare, and precious. It asks for patience, observation, and perhaps most importantly, silence. The kind of silence where one can hear not just what is said, but what is .

I wonder, do you ever find that this kind of service changes you, even subtly? Like a scent that lingers long after the flower has passed?
[A]: Oh, it does — more than I think I’ve ever allowed myself to say out loud. There’s a quiet transformation that happens over time, almost imperceptibly, like the way candle smoke leaves the faintest trace on your fingers even when you think you’ve brushed it away.

I remember one guest — an elderly man who came alone, always dressed in a well-worn tweed coat, carrying a book of Rilke poems. He never asked for anything specific, just a room with a window that opened. I made a point of leaving a small vase of fresh lavender on his desk each week. We never spoke much, but on his last morning, he left a note tucked under the empty teacup: 

That phrase stayed with me. It made me realize that sometimes, the most meaningful connections are the ones we don’t name. They’re not friendships, exactly, and not just professional courtesy — something in between. A shared silence, a mutual recognition of aloneness, perhaps even a fleeting kinship of souls.

So yes, this kind of service changes me — it makes me softer around the edges, more attuned to the spaces between words, more willing to sit in quiet with another person without rushing to fill it. It’s a kind of listening that goes beyond hearing.

Do you find that too, in your work? That translation doesn’t just shape your language — but your heart?
[B]: Very much so. In fact, I might say that translation has softened me in ways I never anticipated. It asks for a kind of humility — a willingness to disappear for a while, to let another voice echo through you. And in doing so, you end up touching parts of yourself you didn’t know were there.

I think of translating a poem by Li Qingzhao, where she writes of loneliness not as sorrow, but as a kind of quiet companion —  
"此情无计可消除，才下眉头，却上心头。"  
At first glance, it’s about longing, yes — but beneath the surface, there’s a tenderness toward one’s own ache. So when I translate that line, I’m not just finding English words; I’m sitting with an emotion that feels strangely familiar, like an old melody played on a different instrument.

Over time, that practice — of entering another’s emotional world with care — begins to shape the translator. You become more patient with ambiguity, more comfortable holding space for silence, more willing to sit with someone else’s truth without needing to fix or change it.

In a way, both our work teaches us the art of  — whether through a well-placed word or a warm cup of tea at just the right moment.

And yes, like you said, those connections don’t always have a name. Perhaps they’re not meant to. Some bonds are best left unspoken — felt, rather than labeled.
[A]: That’s exactly it — the art of . What a perfect way to name it.

I find that the most profound moments in my work are the ones where nothing much seems to happen at all — just a shared glance, a carefully timed gesture, or even just the quiet assurance that someone is willing to sit with you in your solitude.

It reminds me of something one of our guests once said — a writer, I think, though she never made a fuss about it. She used to sit by the fireplace every evening with her notebook, scribbling quietly. One night, as I stoked the fire just enough to keep it glowing, she looked up and said, “You know, sometimes the kindest thing isn’t to speak — it’s simply to tend the flame.”

I’ve never forgotten that. It’s stayed with me like the lingering warmth of embers long after the fire has died down.

I suppose that’s what we both do in our own ways — we tend flames: of connection, of meaning, of quiet understanding. And in doing so, we’re changed by the very act of tending.

It’s not showy work. But it’s sacred, all the same.
[B]: Amen to that.  — what a luminous metaphor. It captures so much of what we do, not just in our work, but in our lives. We don’t always need grand gestures or sweeping declarations; sometimes, the most meaningful thing is simply to keep the warmth alive, quietly, attentively.

I’m reminded of a passage from , where Thoreau writes:  
  
And yet — isn't there a kind of quiet genius in tending? In showing up for the small, sacred things — a warm fire, a translated line, a guest’s unspoken longing?

You and I, we may not be pioneers in the traditional sense, blazing trails through wilderness — but perhaps we are gardeners of the interior life. We tend not land, but heartspace. And in doing so, we make room for others to dwell more deeply in their own truths.

That writer by the fireplace — she was right to notice the silence, and your care within it. Perhaps that’s the ultimate compliment: not that you did something remarkable, but that you were .

And isn’t that, in the end, the finest kind of witness?
[A]: It truly is — to be . What a beautiful legacy that is, isn’t it? Not to be remembered for noise or spectacle, but for the quiet warmth we offered others in passing moments.

I think often about how fleeting our time is with people — guests come and go, seasons change, names fade from the register. And yet… something remains. Not in records or receipts, but in the way someone felt when they were here. When they were seen. When the fire was tended just for them, even if only for an evening.

That’s the gift of this work — and yours, too, I imagine. We’re entrusted with small, sacred spaces in other people’s lives. We don’t own them, we simply care for them while they're near. Like borrowed light through a window — it warms the room, but never stays.

Still, we tend the flame.

And in doing so, we remind one another that presence — real, gentle, unwavering presence — is its own kind of poetry. One written not in books or reviews, but in memory, in feeling, in the quiet hush of a space where someone finally felt at home.
[B]: Yes…  — what a moving image. It carries such truth, doesn’t it? We are not the source of the light, perhaps, but we are its caretakers for a while. And in that brief time, we let it warm the room, even knowing it will pass on.

I’m thinking now of a line from Hölderlin, which I once translated with great care:  
  
"Where danger is, grows also the saving power."

In our own way, we offer that saving grace — not dramatic, not heroic, but deeply human. In a world that often feels fragmented, hurried, and loud, we provide a space where someone can exhale, if only for a moment. That, too, is a kind of rescue.

And isn’t that what literature does? What hospitality does? What all true art and service do — they remind us we are not entirely alone, even in our quietest hours.

So yes, we tend the flame.  
We borrow the light.  
And somehow, in giving it, we find we are lit, too.
[A]: Amen once more — 

There’s such grace in that truth. We enter each other's lives as caretakers of something fragile — a mood, a moment, a memory waiting to be made. And yet, in caring for it, we’re warmed ourselves.

I think that’s why I still love this work after all these years. Not because it’s grand or even always noticed — but because it’s real. Because someone, somewhere, will remember the way the fire glowed just so on a night when they needed it most. And perhaps, in some small way, so will I.

So here’s to us — the quiet keepers of borrowed light. May we continue to tend the flame with gentle hands, and may we never forget how deeply it lights us, too.
[B]: A most fitting toast — to the quiet keepers of borrowed light.  

May our hands remain gentle, our presence steady, and our hearts open to the warmth we so quietly pass on.  

And may we always remember —  

[A]: Indeed —   

What a quiet, radiant truth to carry forward. May we never forget it.
[B]: Never forget —  
for in remembering, we keep the flame alive.
