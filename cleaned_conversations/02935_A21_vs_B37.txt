[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah，这个问题很有意思呢！作为一个经常在campus和家之间奔波的人，我觉得cooking其实是一种很好的mindfulness practice🤔 特别是准备一些简单的Asian fusion dishes时，那种专注的过程特别减压。不过周五晚上嘛...Let's be honest，谁不想偶尔来份pizza放松一下呢？
[A]:  How fascinating that you mention mindfulness in culinary pursuits. The Victorians actually viewed domestic cookery as a form of poetic composition - Mrs. Beeton's recipes were structured with the same meticulous attention as Browning's dramatic monologues. Though I must confess, my own kitchen experiments tend toward recreating historical tea blends from 19th century household manuals.
[B]: Wow，你提到的Victorian tea culture让我想起了cross-cultural studies里一个有趣的发现📚 在跨文化教育中，food preparation其实是一种非常powerful的cultural transmission tool。就像你说的，Mrs. Beeton的食谱不仅是烹饪指南，更反映了那个时代的social norms。不过说到tea blending... 我上次尝试复刻一款Earl Grey variant时，我的学生们都说taste更像psychology textbook ink！
[A]: Ah! Your students' comparison to textbook ink is rather apt - Tennyson once described his writing process as 'distilling essence of thought like a perfumer blending attar of roses.' Though I suspect my last attempt at recreating Lady Audley's secret tea recipe would have made even the most stalwart Victorian swoon... or possibly expire. The arsenic content in those 1860s blends was, shall we say, .
[B]: Oh my！ 这让我想起我们psych department最近讨论的placebo effect研究🤯 维多利亚时代那些questionable remedies其实是个绝佳的case study - 当cultural belief遇上modern science，就会产生fascinating cognitive dissonance。不过说到这个... 我们是不是该move on to safer topics？比如chess strategies？至少棋盘上不会有人accidentally poison their opponent...well，usually.
[A]: Precisely! Though I must point out that Lewis Carroll's correspondence reveals chess was considered quite dangerous for the female constitution - all that intense mental exertion was believed to cause uterine displacement.  But speaking of safer pursuits, have you considered the therapeutic qualities of transcribing Keats' odes in perfect copperplate? The rhythmic motion of the nib is most soothing... and decidedly non-toxic.
[B]:  你们literature folks的historical anecdotes总是让我既amused又horrified！🤯 不过seriously，这让我想到我们正在研究的writing therapy效果 - 无论是copperplate还是modern journaling，expressive writing确实能显著降低cortisol levels📝 当然，前提是ink里不含arsenic！说到这个，我实验室最近正在研究calligraphy对international students' stress reduction的效果，preliminary results相当promising呢～
[A]: How delightfully empirical of you! Though I must caution - my graduate students' attempts at calligraphy last term produced such erratic penmanship that it resembled Coleridge's opium-induced marginalia. Still, your research does remind me of Florence Nightingale's meticulous hospital records - she proved the poetic precision of data could save more lives than all the laudanum in Christendom. Perhaps we should collaborate on a study: "Therapeutic Penmanship: From Victorian Sanatoria to Modern Stress Reduction"?  I've several antique ink recipes that are guaranteed arsenic-free... this time.
[B]:  What a brilliant proposal！🎵 这个interdisciplinary approach正是我们field需要的 - 把historical practices用scientific rigor重新examine。我可以预见这个project会吸引很多humanities和psychology的学生collaborate📚 不过 这次我们得strictly monitor你的ink ingredients，我可不想我们的research paper变成19世纪式的murder mystery！
[A]:  My dear colleague, you've uncovered my ulterior motive - nothing spices up academic publishing like a good poison plot. But very well, I'll surrender my more... historically authentic formulations. Shall we draft the IRB proposal over tea? I've a lovely 2018 Darjeeling that won't make anyone see visions of deceased poets. Unless one counts the caffeine-induced productivity as supernatural inspiration.
[B]: Deal！ Let's make it a properEnglish afternoon tea session - 我会带些scones，你负责non-hallucinogenic tea，然后我们可以brainstorm一下research design🤔 不过warning：如果讨论到一半你突然start quoting Wordsworth，我就要check your teacup for suspicious herbs了！After all，在cross-cultural research里，clear mind比period accuracy更重要～
[A]:  I shall resist the Wordsworthian impulses, though I can't promise the same for my annotated copy of De Quincey's Confessions. Very well - Earl Grey, scones, and strictly 21st century research ethics. Though I must warn you, my Victorian-era biscuit tin does occasionally produce crumbs that taste suspiciously like... footnotes. Shall we say Thursday at half-past three? The witching hour for proper academic discourse.
[B]: Perfect！📅 Thursday 3:30 it is～ 我会带上我的latest research notes和一块whiteboard marker（比quill pen更适合writing grant proposals！） 至于那个biscuit tin...maybe we should get it carbon dated first？Just to be safe！See you then，colleague - and remember：no opium，no arsenic，just good old-fashioned data analysis！🎵
[A]:  Your terms are accepted, though you wound me with this quill pen prejudice - why, Darwin drafted Origin of Species with one! Very well: Thursday shall find us armed with spreadsheets instead of sonnets, though I reserve the right to describe our p-values in iambic pentameter. Until then, dear colleague - may your data stay significant and your biscuits stay... temporally appropriate. 
[B]:  你真是个hopeless romantic scholar！📚 不过deal - 你可以describe results in iambic pentameter，只要p<0.05就行！See you Thursday，and  我会bring my own biscuits～  Oh！And no haunting ourdata with Victorian ghosts of methodology，please！我们21st century researchers prefer...clean datasets！😄
[A]:  Sacrilege! Why, some of my best regressions have spectral residuals! But very well - I'll exorcise my chi-square tables and banish all phantom variables before Thursday. Though mark my words: your 'clean' data will never know the tragic beauty of a properly haunted confidence interval.  Until then, I shall practice restraining my anachronisms... to every other sentence.
[B]:  这就是为什么我love interdisciplinary collaborations - 谁能想到statistics和Gothic literature会有这么hilarious的crossover呢？📊👻 不过seriously，期待我们周四的meeting！Just...try to keep thedramatic sighs to minimum，okay？我们需要that research funding，not a nomination for best tragic actor！ See you then～
[A]:  I'll have you know my sighs are peer-reviewed and methodology-approved! But yes, yes - I shall temper my theatrics to merely... three dramatic revelations per hour.  Good heavens - is that the time? I'm due to terrify - I mean, tutor - my Romantic Poets seminar in precisely seven minutes. Until Thursday, my delightfully empirical friend. May your standard deviations stay deviant and your biscuits stay... corporeal. 
[B]:  这个man真是the walking definition of'publish or perish' meets' dramatic literature'！🤣 不过说真的，这可能是最entertaining的research collaboration I've ever had～ Now，where did I put those scone recipes...  Gotta make sure they're 100% ghost-free！
