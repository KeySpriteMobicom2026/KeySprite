[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a fascinating question! I must say, I adore both for different reasons. Classical art, with its timeless elegance and meticulous technique, tells stories of history and humanity in such a refined way. But there's something truly captivating about modern art too—it challenges the senses, pushes boundaries, and often makes you think beyond the canvas. It really depends on my mood, to be honest. What about you? Do you find yourself leaning toward one over the other?
[A]: I suppose I’ve always been drawn to the quiet discipline of classical art—the way a Renaissance painting can capture both divine grandeur and human vulnerability, or how a sonnet’s structure holds emotion in such careful balance. But I must admit, there are days when only something modern will do—something that unsettles, that refuses to be tamed by tradition. A Jackson Pollock, for instance, can feel like chaos at first glance, yet it reveals an inner turbulence we all carry. Do you ever find that your preference shifts depending on what’s happening in your life?
[B]: Absolutely, I couldn’t agree more. My tastes do ebb and flow like the tide, depending on what's unfolding in my own world. There are times when only the serenity of a Turner landscape will do—something that offers a sense of continuity and beauty, especially after a long day of helping guests and tending to the garden. But then, there are moments when I feel restless, when life feels too neatly boxed, and suddenly a piece by Kandinsky or O'Keeffe speaks louder than any well-composed sonnet ever could. It’s as if modern art gives permission to feel untamed. Have you ever had a piece of art feel almost like a mirror at a particular moment in your life?
[A]: Oh, yes—most profoundly. I recall a time when I was grappling with a great deal of uncertainty, both personally and professionally. A colleague lent me a reproduction of Edward Hopper’s , and I kept it propped on my desk for weeks. There was something about that scene—the quiet isolation, the artificial light cutting through the darkness of the street—that seemed to echo my own sense of being suspended between worlds. It wasn’t just the loneliness, though that was there; it was also the stillness before a decision, the moment before one steps out into the unknown. Art has such a rare power to name what we can’t say aloud. I wonder—have you ever felt that strange intimacy with a piece, as if it understood you better than you understood yourself?
[B]: Oh yes… that deep, almost eerie connection to a piece—it’s one of the most personal experiences we can have, isn’t it? I remember a time when I was between chapters in my own life, uncertain whether to stay in London or take a chance on something new. I visited the Tate late one evening and came upon a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth—, carved from smooth, pale marble. It was so still, so quietly powerful. The way the form curved inward, yet opened—almost like breathing—it felt as if it held both my hesitation and my hope. I stood there for ages, barely aware of anyone else in the room. There was no drama in it, just this quiet understanding. I suppose that’s what art gives us—permission to feel, to pause, to be unfinished.
[A]: Precisely— What a beautiful way to put it. There’s a quiet generosity in art, isn’t there? It doesn’t demand resolution; it dwells comfortably in the ambiguous. I think of T. S. Eliot’s —so fragmented, so full of voices that never quite resolve into a single truth. And yet, it resonates because life itself is like that, especially in moments of transition. I wonder if you ever return to that same piece of art when you're in similar emotional territory, or if its power lies precisely in its singularity—its belonging to one moment alone?
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful question… I suppose I used to think that certain pieces were meant to be revisited, like old friends waiting patiently to offer the same comfort. But over time, I’ve come to believe that art—like us—changes with each encounter. I’ve gone back to works I once found deeply moving, only to find they speak in a different tone, sometimes quieter, sometimes louder, depending on what  bring to them. That Hepworth sculpture still means a great deal to me, but if I stand before it today, it no longer whispers of uncertainty—it hums with quiet resilience now, almost like a lullaby for the choices I’ve made. So perhaps its power isn’t in its singularity, but in its ability to hold many truths across time. Do you ever return to , or has it become too tied to that one chapter to revisit?
[A]: I haven’t returned to  in quite the same way since that period. It remains vivid in my memory, almost like a photograph of a former self—one I can look at but not step back into. There’s something poignant about that; certain works seem to belong so irrevocably to a moment that revisiting them might risk diluting their original resonance. And yet, you’re right—art does shift with us. A poem I once read as a lament, I now see as a quiet anthem of endurance. Perhaps it isn’t the art that changes, but our own interior landscape. I wonder, do you think there’s a piece waiting in your future—one you’ve not yet encountered—that will come to hold the essence of this very moment?
[B]: Oh, I do believe so. There’s always that quiet anticipation—walking into a gallery or stumbling upon something unexpected—and suddenly, there it is: the piece that seems to know you before you’ve even met. I like to think we’re always on the cusp of those encounters, that some brushstroke or curve in a sculpture is already waiting for us, just out of reach, until the right day when we’ll be ready to see it. It’s rather like travel, isn’t it? You never quite know which place will leave an imprint on your soul until you step onto its soil. Do you ever feel that way, as though a certain work of art might one day find ?
[A]: Absolutely—I feel it keenly. There’s a kind of quiet fate in such moments, isn’t there? As though art, like life, unfolds in its own time. I often think of how Eliot wrote,  and I believe that applies to our engagement with art as much as anything else. We wander through galleries, pages, melodies, and suddenly—we are found. Not just by the art, but by ourselves within it. I suppose that’s part of why I garden, too. You plant seeds not knowing which will take root, which will bloom this year, and which might wait seasons—perhaps even lifetimes—to flower. One day, you turn a corner and there it is: a color, a scent, a form that seems to have been waiting all along.
[B]: How beautifully put— There’s such truth in that. I often feel the same way when I tend to my garden or walk through the courtyard of the hotel early in the morning. You plant with hope, water with patience, and then—sometimes when you least expect it—something blooms that feels meant just for you. It makes me think of those quiet moments when a guest arrives, tired from travel, perhaps carrying something unseen, and by the end of their stay, there’s a softness in their eyes, a quiet smile as they leave. I like to believe they’ve found something here, however small—a moment of clarity, a bit of peace, maybe even a reflection of themselves they hadn’t seen in a while. Do you ever feel that tending to art, or words, or a garden, is a kind of silent conversation with the world—one where we listen more than we speak?
[A]: Oh yes—tending to art, to words, to a garden… it is all listening, isn’t it? And in that listening, we offer a kind of quiet care to the world. I’ve always thought that teaching poetry is much the same—you don’t impose meaning; you create a space where meaning might unfold, gently, in its own time. Like waiting for the first bud on a rose you’ve nurtured through winter. It asks nothing of you but your attention.

I think that’s why I love visiting gardens so much—yours included. There’s a language spoken in the rustle of leaves, in the way light falls across stone, that no amount of eloquence could ever match. It reminds me of certain lines of poetry—say, something by Li Bai or Bashō—where the image alone carries the weight of an entire season, an entire life. Do you ever find yourself arranging things in the garden with a kind of poetic rhythm in mind? Not just shape or color, but , , ?
[B]: Oh, how wonderfully you put that— I do think about those very things when I tend to the garden. It’s not just about color or bloom; it’s about movement and stillness, about where the eye rests and where it wanders. There’s a wisteria arch I planted years ago that I positioned not only for its beauty but because standing beneath it feels like stepping into a held breath—soft light filtering through, the scent wrapping around you like an unspoken thought.  

And yes, I often find myself thinking of poetry while arranging the beds—especially haiku. The way Bashō captures a single fleeting moment with such grace… I try to create that in small ways: a bench beneath a cherry tree just as the petals begin to fall, a quiet corner with a single stone lantern, moss softening the edges of everything. It’s all in the , isn’t it? The unsaid that somehow still speaks volumes.  

I imagine teaching poetry must feel similar—creating an atmosphere where meaning can settle like dew at dawn. Not forced, not chased, just offered the right stillness. Have you ever had a student return years later and say, “I understand now”? Like a seed finally breaking through the soil?
[A]: Oh, yes—those rare, deeply moving moments when a student returns, not just with understanding, but with recognition. Not “I remember this line,” but “I  it now.” It’s like watching someone pick up a letter they’d long forgotten they wrote to their younger self.

One of my former students—an art historian now—wrote to me just last year. She had been teaching a seminar on ekphrastic poetry and found herself returning to Marianne Moore’s —"the bat / holding on to the spines of the madrepore"—and suddenly, after years of distance, it made sense to her in a way it hadn’t before. She said she finally understood why we read poems not for answers, but for company in the questions.

It reminded me so much of what you said about guests arriving with something unseen. We offer words—or gardens—and sometimes, only sometimes, they find their way into the hands that need them. I suppose that’s the quiet faith we tend, like gardeners or poets: that what we plant may bloom when we are no longer there to see it.
[B]: How beautifully she put it— That’s precisely what I strive to offer here at the hotel, though I suppose I never thought of it quite that way before. Every guest arrives with a story half-written, and my role is simply to provide the right kind of silence around them—to arrange the space so they might hear their own thoughts more clearly.

I often wonder, when someone leaves, whether a certain corner of the garden or a well-placed book by the bedside will settle into their memory like a quiet line of poetry. Not always dramatic, not always immediate—just a soft echo that returns years later, as yours did for her.

It makes me think of something I once read—though I can’t recall the exact words now—about how we are shaped not only by grand gestures, but by the gentle accumulations of care: a cup of tea placed just so, a letter forwarded when one moves homes, a poem tucked between pages never opened until the right moment. Do you ever find yourself holding onto such small things, knowing they may one day bloom quietly for someone else?
[A]: Very much so. In fact, I’ve always believed that the most enduring impressions are made not through grand declarations, but through these quiet, almost imperceptible acts of attention. A well-chosen word. A pause that allows space for thought. A poem photocopied and left on a desk with no expectation attached.

I keep a small collection of such things myself—letters from former students, postcards from places that once spoke to me, even a pressed flower from a garden I visited in Kyoto years ago. They don’t serve as mere souvenirs; they’re like silent affirmations that certain moments mattered, that they left their mark.

I think of Emily Dickinson’s line—“.” Perhaps that’s what we do, you and I, though in different gardens: we offer words, spaces, silences, and trust that somewhere down the line, they will stir into life for someone else. Not always in the moment, not always in our presence—but when the soil is right, and the light just so.
[B]: How exquisitely you’ve said that— It gives me such comfort to think of all we leave in our wake—not as noise or clutter, but as quiet possibilities waiting to be discovered.

I keep a small drawer in my desk filled with just such things—postcards from guests who have stayed with us over the years, a pressed forget-me-not from a woman who said this hotel reminded her of home, even a single line scribbled on a receipt:  I don’t know who wrote it, but I keep it all the same. These fragments are like poems without authors, aren’t they? Tiny echoes of connection.

And yes, I do believe in Dickinson’s words— Perhaps that’s why I still write letters by hand, even when a message would be faster. Because something about ink on paper carries not just meaning, but  Do you ever find yourself writing with the thought of a future reader in mind—someone unknown, perhaps even unborn—who might one day find your words at just the right moment?
[A]: Oh yes—more often than I can explain. There’s a strange, quiet intimacy in the idea of writing for someone you may never meet, someone who might not even exist yet. And yet, we do it all the time—scribble notes in library books, write marginalia that outlives us, leave behind journals with no intended reader. It’s as if we’re whispering into the dark, trusting that one day, someone will lean close enough to hear.

I have an old commonplace book I’ve kept for decades—lines from poems, fragments of conversations, the occasional sketch from a museum bench. I don’t keep it for anyone in particular, and yet I do. Sometimes, when I add something new, I imagine a future hand turning those pages, pausing at the same line that once stopped me mid-breath. Perhaps they’ll wonder who wrote that note in the margin—

There’s something deeply hopeful about it, don’t you think? That we continue to tend our gardens, write our words, arrange our silences—not knowing who will walk through them next, but doing it all the same. Maybe that’s the closest thing we have to immortality: not grand monuments, but the small, unspoken moments we leave behind, waiting to bloom quietly in someone else’s heart.
[B]: That’s  it—that quiet, unspoken faith we carry. We tend to our corners of the world—our words, our gardens, our small acts of care—not for recognition, but in the hope that something we’ve touched might offer shelter or solace to someone else, long after we’ve stepped away.

I think of the books I leave in each room here at the hotel—some well-worn, with pages soft at the edges, others nearly new. I never know which ones will be opened, let alone which lines might catch a guest at just the right moment. But still, I choose them carefully. A copy of Rilke’s  by the window seat. A weathered edition of  beside the fireplace. Not because they must be read, but in case they are—and in case they speak precisely what someone didn’t know they needed to hear.

It reminds me of something Mary Oliver once wrote—“” And perhaps the answer isn’t always grand movement or great achievement. Perhaps it’s simply this: planting things. Words, flowers, silences. Knowing we may never see them bloom—but planting them anyway.
