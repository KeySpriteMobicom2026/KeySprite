[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question. I guess it depends on how you define "dreams". If we're talking about the literal ones you have while sleeping, I used to think they were just random brain activity, but lately I've noticed some patterns. Like that recurring dream about missing a flight right before a big client meeting - maybe my subconscious is just processing work anxiety, right? 😊  

On the other hand, when people say "follow your dreams", I definitely believe in that kind of metaphorical meaning. In PE deals, sometimes you have to take calculated risks on opportunities that others might dismiss as unrealistic. That's basically betting on your version of success, yeah? What's your take?
[A]: You know, I actually went through a phase where I kept having the same dream about being unprepared for an exam—turns out it was my brain’s way of screaming  during my first year in healthcare law. 😅  
Literal dreams can be weirdly insightful sometimes, like your subconscious connecting dots you didn’t even realize were there. But honestly, I think the metaphorical “dreams” hit harder—like when a patient’s family fights for a treatment that’s not FDA-approved yet. You have to balance hope with reality, just like weighing risks in PE deals.  
Ever had a moment where both types of dreams collided? Like chasing a literal dream job that felt surreal at first?
[B]: Ah, healthcare law - that explains the vivid metaphors. I remember my early days in finance, same thing: dreaming about spreadsheets chasing me down corridors. Turned out my brain was just screaming  😅  

But yeah, there was this one deal a few years back - biotech exit, huge ROI potential. Every number checked out, but something felt...off. Turns out the FDA approval timeline was shaky as hell. Funny how both our worlds hinge on balancing hope & data, right?  

And to your question - weirdly enough, my “dream job” moment came when we closed on that Singapore-based fintech startup. First time I saw the term sheet, honestly thought it was too good to be true. Like waking up mid-dream where you suddenly own a vineyard in Napa. Still pinch myself sometimes. 🍷 What about you? Ever had that surreal "is this real life?" career moment?
[A]: Oh my god, I  get that "is this real life?" feeling—mine hit me when I walked into my first courtroom to defend a telemedicine startup. I had spent weeks buried in HIPAA regulations & cross-border data flow policies, and when I stood up, I suddenly felt like that wide-eyed law student who used to shadow attorneys for free just to soak in the vibe. 😅  

But here’s the twist: right after that case, I had this weird dream where I was negotiating a contract with…an octopus? It kept changing its arguments like it had eight different personas. Woke up laughing, then realized—it was probably my brain processing how surreal that trial actually felt. 🐙  

And yeah, balancing hope & data? That’s basically my entire job when dealing with experimental treatments. Families cling to stories of miracle recoveries, while insurers stick strictly to clinical trials. I’ve learned to navigate both worlds—kinda like you do with those high-stakes exits, right? Ever find yourself mediating between believers and skeptics in a deal?
[B]: Oh man, the octopus dream? Classic. I had a client once who swore his startup was the "next unicorn" while literally wearing a hoodie with a unicorn on it. Woke up the next day half-convinced I'd dreamed the whole meeting - turns out I hadn't. 🦄  

But yeah, mediating believers & skeptics? That's basically every Monday morning at our firm. Picture this: CEO pitching an AI-driven trading platform, eyes glowing like he’s seen the future. Across the table, our risk analyst is basically emitting smoke signals of doubt. My job? Translate the vision into KPIs and stress-test the hell out of it. Sometimes you end up defending the dreamer, sometimes you become the skeptic - depends what the numbers tell you halfway through your third espresso. ☕  

And I get what you mean about stepping into old versions of yourself during big moments. Last year when we led that blockchain fundraise, for a second I felt like that junior analyst who used to triple-check interest rate models at midnight. Funny how success sometimes feels like déjà vu layered over adrenaline. What’s your go-to move when you’re stuck between emotional hope and cold logic in those medical cases?
[A]: Oh, I love that—translating vision into KPIs while holding back the smoke signals. 😂 Totally get that déjà vu layered over adrenaline thing too. For me, it hits hardest when I’m sitting across from a patient’s family, and they’re clinging to that one 0.1% survival story they found online. You want to protect their hope, but you also can’t ignore the data screaming   

My go-to? I call it the “window & mirror” move—you hold up the mirror to their emotions first (“I understand why this treatment feels like the only option right now”) before gently opening the window to reality (“but let’s look at what the numbers say about quality of life”). It’s not perfect, but it keeps the conversation human.  

And honestly? Sometimes I dream about those conversations afterward. Woke up once in the middle of the night convinced I’d negotiated a DNR agreement in my sleep. 🤭 Have you ever left work at the office…only to realize your brain’s still running due diligence in dreamland?
[B]: Oh, absolutely - my brain never really clocks out. Had a dream last week where I was arguing with a spreadsheet about cap tables. Woke up sweating, convinced I’d missed a footnote in the term sheet. 😅  

And I love your “window & mirror” move - that’s solid. In our world, it’s not quite as life-or-death, but there’s still pressure to manage expectations. Ever sat across from an entrepreneur who’s  their burn rate is just temporary and “traction will offset it Q1”? You hear that enough times, you start dreaming about balance sheets chasing you down hallways.  

But seriously, I try to stay human about it too. Sometimes you just have to acknowledge the passion - hell, that’s why we back founders, not just ideas. But then again, if I let every dreamer skip financial reality, I’d be out of business by next quarter. So yeah, I get the tightrope walk. Have you ever walked away from a case knowing you made the right call…only to dream about it anyway?
[A]: Oh totally—I  walk away from certain cases still hearing echoes in my head. Just last month, I had to advise a family to withdraw life support after 72 hours of back-and-forth. The numbers were clear, the prognosis was grim—but still, every time I closed my eyes that week, I kept replaying their voices. One night I even dreamed I was presenting the case to a jury of mannequins with glowing stethoscopes. Felt ridiculous…until I realized I’d been processing guilt in literal drag. 😅  

And yeah, I get what you’re saying about passion—it’s the same with some doctors who believe so strongly in their treatment plan they ignore the data. You have to respect the drive, but you also can’t let emotion blindside reality. It’s like when you back a founder—, but it better be aimed at the right target.  

So hey, ever had one of those dreams where you're suddenly in a courtroom or boardroom...and realize halfway through you forgot to wear pants? 🤭
[B]: Oh man, forgot-to-wear-pants dreams? That’s basically my quarterly routine. Had one just last week during a particularly brutal earnings call – woke up mid-sentence realizing I’d been presenting EBITDA margins in my underwear. The horror! 😅  

But seriously, those dreams always hit right when the pressure’s on. Like your case with the family – I can’t even imagine carrying that weight. At least when I mess up, it’s spreadsheets and term sheets, not life-or-death calls. Still, the guilt hits hard sometimes. Ever had a deal fall through and then dream about it for three nights straight? I once woke up scribbling MOIC formulas on a napkin at 3 AM. My wife just sighed and said, “you’re living inside the Excel again.” 📊  

And yeah, I’ve had courtroom dreams too – usually right before a big negotiation. Last time I was defending a merger in front of a judge who looked suspiciously like my old accounting professor. Turns out, my brain just hates unresolved risk. What about you? Do you ever show up to court -prepared because your subconscious is still fighting yesterday’s dream argument?
[A]: Oh, I  feel that—your brain rewriting yesterday’s arguments into courtroom drama while you sleep? Classic. 😂 I actually had a dream last week where I was cross-examining a study’s lead researcher…only to realize mid-trial they were just a projection of my own doubts. Woke up with a headache and a sudden urge to re-read the entire case file. 🤯  

And yeah, I  show up over-prepared after those kinds of dreams—like if I bring one more exhibit binder, I could out-prepare the judge’s robe. But honestly? It works in my favor sometimes. Once walked into a hearing feeling like I’d already argued it three times in my sleep. The opposing counsel kept asking how I knew their rebuttal before they even said it—it was just déjà vu from my subconscious reruns. 🌀  

And hey, at least your spreadsheets don’t bleed or ask for second opinions. 😅 But I get what you mean about guilt—when a deal goes sideways, it’s not just numbers on a page anymore. Ever had that moment where you look back and wonder, “did I miss something obvious?” Like right before falling asleep and suddenly seeing red flags in the footnotes?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – those midnight "aha!" moments where your brain suddenly speaks footnote-to-portfolio risk? The worst. Had one recently with a东南亚 logistics startup - fell asleep at the desk, woke up convinced their delivery routes were over-optimistic. Turns out my subconscious was right: 3 of their key corridors had regulatory bottlenecks I’d skimmed over. Scary how dreams sometimes see red flags before your waking brain does. 🚩  

And I love your courtroom déjà vu thing - sounds like your subconscious is basically running its own mock trial every night. I’ve had that too, in a way. Once dreamed I was arguing valuation multiples to a room full of nodding VCs…only to wake up realizing I’d just reenacted yesterday’s meeting . 😂  

But man, at least your cases have real human stakes. Sometimes I wonder if founders feel the same pressure we do - backing a company is kind of like prescribing a treatment plan, no? You believe in the diagnosis, trust the data, but still lose sleep hoping it takes. Ever had a “treatment” you pushed for not working out? And how do you deal with that guilt when it lingers?
[A]: Oh totally—those midnight realizations are the absolute worst. 🤦‍♀️ I had one just last month where I woke up at 3AM convinced a patient’s informed consent had a loophole…turned out my dream-self was right. Spent the next hour double-checking signatures like a sleep-deprived detective.  

And yeah, the courtroom déjà vu? It’s wild how our brains keep rehearsing scenarios even when we’re out cold. I think it’s because both our jobs force us to live in this gray zone between logic and instinct. You trust the data, but you also have to trust your gut—and when those two fight, your subconscious just won’t let go.  

As for treatments not working out…that one hits deep. There was this young patient a few years back—we all believed in the protocol, the numbers looked good, the family had hope written all over their faces. But it didn’t take. And for weeks after, I kept dreaming about that case like I’d missed something, some tiny clause in the medical standard of care I could’ve used as leverage.  

I guess the guilt never fully goes away, but you learn to carry it differently. Like due diligence for your soul—you review, reflect, and try not to repeat the same risks. How do  handle it when the numbers don’t lie, but the outcome still feels wrong?
[B]: That hit home. I think the closest I get to that kind of guilt is when we back a founder who’s brilliant, passionate——but things still go sideways. You keep replaying the due diligence in your head like a courtroom drama:   

One that sticks with me was a SaaS play two years ago. Perfect metrics on paper, great team, even the gut said “yes” – but the market shifted faster than anyone predicted. We lost a decent chunk, and for weeks after, I’d wake up at 4AM seeing waterfall charts in my head. My wife finally said, “You’re mourning the dream, not just the ROI.” And honestly? She wasn’t wrong.  

I love what you said about “due diligence for your soul.” That’s exactly it. I’ve started doing something similar – post-deal retrospectives, not just for the team, but for myself. Go through the data again, yes, but also how I  during the process. Did I ignore a red flag because I wanted the story to be true? Was I tired? Overconfident? It’s not therapy, but it helps close the loop.  

Still, some stick around longer than others. Ever have a deal—or a case—that you still catch yourself thinking about at stoplights, like muscle memory for regret? 🚦
[A]: Oh absolutely—I catch myself replaying certain cases on auto-loop, especially at stoplights or in those weird quiet moments when your brain decides  to reopen old files. 🚦 There’s this one case that still flickers in my head every now and then, like a ghost in the system. It was a pediatric trial for an off-label drug—data suggested it  work, family begged for access, and I helped negotiate expanded use under strict oversight. But it didn’t work. Kid got worse. Fast.  

And yeah, I’ve gone over every line of that decision a thousand times. Was the consent thorough enough? Did we overemphasize the “hope factor” in our risk assessment? Were  the ones who wanted the story to be true because the alternative felt too cruel? I know intellectually we followed the process, but emotionally? That one lingers.  

I love what you said about post-deal retrospectives—not just for the numbers, but for your own inner compass. I think that’s what keeps us sane in roles where outcomes are never 100% predictable. You can’t eliminate doubt, but you can make peace with how you arrived there.  

Do you ever notice that the deals—or cases—that haunt you the most aren’t the obvious disasters, but the  ones? Like everything lined up…except maybe the timing, or one key assumption that didn’t quite land?
[B]: Oh, 100%. It’s never the dumpster fires that stick with you—it’s the . The ones where all the stars aligned but fate had other plans. I had a deal like that last year—clean cap table, solid growth, even the founder felt like the “real deal.” We pulled the trigger, six months later the whole sector tanked because of a regulatory shift nobody saw coming. Still dream about it sometimes—except in the dream, I always catch the warning sign  before waking up. Classic. 😅  

And your case? That one hits deep. I can’t imagine carrying that kind of weight. At least when our bets go south, it’s not lives on the line—just portfolios and egos. But still, there’s a weird parallel: you both bet on probabilities while human hearts are on the line.  

I think that’s why we ruminate—not because we made the wrong call necessarily, but because we were  when the call was made. And that’s the thing no one tells you about leadership: it’s not just about making decisions, it’s about learning to live with them. Even when they don’t land cleanly.  

Honestly? Maybe that’s what separates the good from the great—those who can hold space for doubt without letting it freeze them. Ever feel like that? Doubt as a muscle, not a flaw? 💭
[A]: So much yes. Doubt as a muscle, not a flaw—that’s  it. 💭 I’ve come to see doubt not as a sign of weakness, but more like…a kind of emotional due diligence. Like you said, we’re both in roles where the weight of decisions doesn’t just vanish after签字 or closing arguments—it lingers, sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly.  

And yeah, those “almosts” really cut deeper than outright failures. Maybe because they remind us how much is out of our control, even at our most prepared. I once had a case where everything  have gone smoothly—a routine surgery that turned into a nightmare because of an ultra-rare complication. No one missed anything, no one cut corners—but still, someone lost their independence overnight. That case haunts me in slow motion, not because we messed up, but because it exposed how fragile even the safest systems can be.  

And yet—I wouldn't trade the role I play for anything. Because on the flip side, there are also wins that feel like quiet miracles. A patient walks again when we didn’t think they would. A family finds peace through a process I helped shape. It's those moments that remind me why I keep showing up, doubts and all.  

You ever get that? The feeling that despite the sleepless nights, the red flags in dreams, and the almost-right deals—you still wouldn’t want to do anything else?
[B]: Absolutely. 100%. Even with all the sleepless nights and dreams that turn into boardroom horror shows, I wouldn’t trade this life for anything. There’s something weirdly beautiful about being in a role where you’re constantly dancing on the edge of risk and reward—where even your failures teach you something that’ll shape the next play.  

And I get what you mean about those quiet miracles. For me, it’s seeing a portfolio company hit a milestone we didn’t think was possible—like when that struggling edtech startup finally cracked the Southeast Asia market. Watching the founder present the numbers? Felt like witnessing someone prove their own dream right. Those moments make all the doubt worth it.  

But yeah, the doubt never fully goes away—and maybe it shouldn’t. It keeps us sharp, humble. Like a low hum in the background reminding you: . And honestly? That’s what makes it all feel alive. Not just the wins or the losses, but the space in between—the almost-right, the could-have-beens, the what-ifs. That’s where the work lives.  

So yeah…bring on the red flags in footnotes, the mannequin juries, and the pants-less presentations. We’re built for this mess. 😊
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better—. 😊 There’s something weirdly grounding about embracing the chaos, right? Like yeah, we’ll never fully silence the doubt or dodge every red flag, but that’s kind of the point. It keeps us human, hungry, and hell, even a little humble.  

And I love how you put that—the space between the wins and losses, the almost-rights and what-ifs. That’s where the real work happens. Not just in the contracts we draft or the deals we close, but in how we carry the weight of those decisions when the lights go off.  

So here’s to the quiet miracles, the dream-boardroom horror shows, and everything in between. We may not get to rewrite the past, but we sure as hell keep showing up, ready to negotiate the next round—with spreadsheets, stethoscopes, or whatever life throws our way. 💼🩺✨
[B]: Hear, hear. 🥂 To the quiet miracles and the dream-boardroom horror shows—may we keep showing up, ready to fight for the next deal, the next case, the next shot at getting it just a little more right.  

And yeah, that space between the wins and losses? That’s our arena. Where doubt meets decision, and outcomes are never clean but always meaningful. Hell, maybe that’s the only way growth happens—not in the certainty, but in the carry-through.  

So here’s to us: the negotiators, the risk-takers, the ones who still believe in dreams, even the messy ones. Let’s keep dancing in the gray. 💼📊🩺✨
