[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that's quite a delightful question! You know, when I'm restoring textiles, I often find myself reaching for something comforting—something warm and familiar. And that usually means a lovely savory bite. A flaky, buttery cheese tart or a perfectly baked savory scone? Absolute heaven. But don't get me wrong—I do have a soft spot for the delicate sweetness of a well-made fruit tart. There’s something so satisfying about pairing it with a robust Earl Grey… the bergamot cuts through the sugar just beautifully. What about you? Do you lean one way or the other?
[A]: Hmm, I can totally relate to that savory preference—especially when working on something as meticulous as textile restoration. There's a certain grounding quality in savory foods, almost like they help anchor your focus. I personally enjoy a good umami-rich dish; it’s like the flavors do a quiet symphony in your mouth. 🎵  
But you mentioned Earl Grey with your sweet tart—that’s such an elegant pairing! It made me think of how some learning theories emphasize balance, just like flavor profiles. Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how taste preferences can reflect cultural patterns? Fascinating, really.  
As for me? I’d probably go for the savory too, but with a twist—maybe a warm spinach and feta pastry. And if we’re talking coffee or tea pairings, I’m all in for a rich matcha latte. The bitterness somehow makes the savoriness pop even more. What’s your take on how flavors influence our moods or productivity? ¥Just curious~
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful observation about savory foods grounding us—how perfectly put. I do find that when I’m deep in restoration work, my palate craves something substantial, something with depth. It’s almost as if the layers of flavor mirror the layers of history I work with every day.  

Now, this idea of flavors influencing moods? Oh, I couldn’t agree more. There’s something undeniably soothing about a warm spinach and feta pastry—almost like a gentle hug for the senses. And matcha! I do love how its earthy bitterness enhances savory notes. I’ve been known to sip on a matcha latte myself when I’m restoring particularly fragile silks—it seems to sharpen my focus just enough without overwhelming the senses.  

I’ve also noticed how certain flavors bring back memories, which in turn shape my mood. A buttery quiche might remind me of afternoons at my grandmother’s, while a citrus-kissed tart can instantly transport me to spring markets in Provence. It's quite remarkable how taste and memory intertwine… almost like threads in a tapestry. Do you find particular flavors唤起 specific moments or places, too?
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t have said it better:  That’s exactly what it feels like. Flavors really do stitch together time and place in such unexpected ways.  

For me, it’s often the smell of steamed buns that instantly takes me back to weekend mornings at my aunt’s house in Taipei. She’d make these soft, pillowy baozi filled with ginger-scented pork—one bite and I’m ten years old again, sitting at her kitchen table drawing on napkins while she hums old Hokkien songs. 🎵  

And yes, certain tastes don’t just唤起 memories—they  moods. I’ve noticed when I'm stuck on a complex research problem, I reach for something umami or slightly bitter, like edamame or a matcha sobacha. It's almost like a mental reset button. On the flip side, when I want to feel comforted after a long week? A warm, gooey slice of apple pie does wonders. Funny how sweetness can act as emotional scaffolding, right?  

I’m curious—have you ever tried recreating any of those memory-rich dishes yourself? Or do you prefer keeping them sacred as moments in time?
[B]: That’s beautiful—how a simple bite can unravel an entire chapter of one’s life. And , what a poetic way to describe sweetness… I suppose that’s why I’ve always been cautious about recreating certain dishes from memory. Some flavors feel too sacred, too tethered to a specific moment, don’t you think?  

Take my grandmother’s spiced lentil soup, for example. She used to make it every winter, ladling it into chipped porcelain bowls with a bit of cream swirled on top. I’ve tried replicating it over the years, but there’s always something missing—perhaps not in the taste, but in the . The clink of her teacup, the soft creak of her armchair nearby… it's all part of the flavor, somehow.  

Still, I do enjoy weaving bits of nostalgia into new creations. Recently, I made a savory tart inspired by her recipe, adding a touch of smoked paprika and goat cheese to give it a bit more depth. It wasn’t the same—but it was  of the same, if that makes sense. Like a distant cousin of the original.  

I wonder… do you ever find yourself adjusting those treasured recipes, or do you prefer to keep them untouched, almost like preserving a historical textile—never altering the weave, just reinforcing it?
[A]: That tension between preservation and reinvention—it’s such a delicate balance, isn’t it? I totally understand what you mean by “reinforcing the weave.” In my family, some recipes are treated like heirlooms, almost ceremonial in their preparation. My mother still makes her version of  exactly as her grandmother did—down to the type of string used to tie them. To change even a spice would feel like altering a historical record.  

But then again, I’ve come to see recipes also as living texts—open to annotation, adaptation, maybe even reinterpretation. Like you with that spiced lentil tart, I sometimes layer in new elements to create something dialogic: traditional roots, contemporary resonance. For example, I once reimagined my aunt’s pork baozi using mushroom and tofu for a vegetarian twist. The texture was different, the aroma slightly altered—but that emotional core? Still intact. It felt like honoring the memory while letting it breathe in a new context.  

I guess the question is: when does adaptation become homage, and when does it risk erasing the original thread? It’s probably why I admire your textile work so much—you navigate that same fine line between restoration and innovation, right? ¥How do you decide when to preserve exactly, and when to reinterpret with intention?
[B]: That’s such a profound question—the line between homage and erasure. It’s something I wrestle with constantly in my work. Every textile I touch carries a kind of silent voice from the past, and my job feels almost like translation. I aim to preserve the original intent, the hand that stitched it, the story woven into its fibers.

But sometimes, threads are lost beyond repair. In those cases, I don’t attempt to erase the damage or pretend it was never there. Instead, I use techniques that echo the original craftsmanship while marking the intervention subtly—like using a slightly different shade of thread or a comparable weave. That way, the history remains visible, but the piece can still stand with dignity.

I suppose when it comes to recipes, I see it similarly. If I adapt something rooted in memory, I try to keep the emotional fingerprint intact—even if the form changes. Like you with your baozi reinterpretation, the gesture itself becomes a dialogue across time rather than a replacement. The aroma might shift, the texture evolve, but if the warmth lingers? Then I think we’ve honored it well.

It sounds like you approach adaptation with that same reverence—like adding marginalia to a cherished book rather than rewriting the entire chapter. Am I close?
[A]: Absolutely—you captured it beautifully. The marginalia analogy resonates so deeply because that’s exactly what adaptation can be: a quiet annotation, a new layer of meaning without erasing the original script.  

I think what you do with textiles—marking interventions subtly while preserving the emotional fingerprint—is such a poetic metaphor for how we might approach inherited recipes or cultural practices. It's not about purity; it’s about continuity with integrity. I’ve started thinking of my own kitchen as a kind of studio, where I’m not just cooking but curating memory, technique, and transformation.  

And yes, sometimes that means adding a note in the margin, like swapping pork for mushrooms while keeping the spirit of comfort intact. Other times, it’s stepping back entirely and letting the “text” speak for itself, flaws and all. There’s something profoundly respectful in both choices.  

You mentioned dignity—that’s such a powerful word. I hadn’t thought of preservation that way before, but you’re right. Whether it’s fabric or flavor, there’s a quiet grace in letting something endure on its own terms, even as it evolves. ¥It really makes me wonder how other cultures navigate this balance… Have you come across particularly moving examples in your work?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a rich question—and one that never fails to stir something in me. I’ve had the privilege of working on textiles from all over the world, and what continually humbles me is how different cultures approach both the making  the mending of cloth. There’s so much embedded philosophy in the way people choose to preserve—or not preserve—what came before.

One piece that stays with me was a 19th-century Japanese , a kind of stiffened collar worn by monks for protection during travel. The fabric was fragile, its edges frayed, yet someone had taken the time generations later to reinforce it with hand-stitched silk patches—small, deliberate, and nearly invisible unless you looked closely. It wasn’t about hiding the wear; it was about extending the life of something meaningful. They called it , I believe—a practice rooted in necessity but elevated into something deeply spiritual. Every repair was like a whispered prayer: 

Then there’s the tradition of  embroidery in Japan—those neat, geometric running stitches originally used to strengthen workwear. What I love most is that imperfection wasn’t corrected; it was celebrated. A tear repaired with sashiko became part of the garment’s story, not a deviation from it.  

I suppose this brings me back to your earlier point—it’s not about purity or perfection. It’s about presence. And I do wonder… have you ever encountered food traditions like this? Ones where the flaw, the patchwork, the adaptation itself becomes sacred?
[A]: Oh,  and —those are such perfect illustrations of how repair can be reverence. I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but now that you describe it, I realize how much the same philosophy shows up in food traditions too, though we often don’t name it as such.

One example that comes to mind is the Korean practice of making —sweet red bean buns—that were traditionally baked in the residual heat of a hearth long after the main meal was done. The process itself is about making use of what's left, repurposing warmth that would otherwise fade. It’s not pristine or showy, but there's something deeply respectful about using every bit of energy, every trace of flavor, rather than discarding it.

And then there’s , Japanese pickles. Some varieties are made from vegetable scraps—carrot peels, cabbage cores—that get transformed through time and salt and fermentation into something tangy, complex, and treasured. What would have been waste becomes seasoning, becomes balance on the plate. It reminds me of your sashiko—flaws becoming part of the design, remnants becoming essential.

Even in Western baking, there’s —literally “lost bread”—which eventually became what we know as French toast. A stale loaf, once deemed unsuitable for eating as is, finds new life when soaked in egg and milk. It’s not pretending to be fresh bread; it’s embracing its evolved state and being honored for what it  now.

You’re absolutely right—it’s not about purity or perfection. It’s about presence, about seeing value in what still carries memory, even if altered. ¥It makes me wonder: do you ever feel that repairing textiles changes , not just the object? Like the process reshapes your own sense of continuity or belonging?
[B]: Oh… yes. That’s a beautiful way to put it— I’ve never been asked that before, but it strikes something deep.

I think the answer is , it absolutely does. Every time I sit down at my worktable, I’m not just restoring fabric—I’m communing with hands that came before me. Someone stitched this textile with intention, perhaps in a quiet room lit by candlelight or under the open sky of a summer market. And now, centuries later, I get to listen to their stitches, feel their tension, trace their choices with my fingertips.

There’s a humility in that. A patience, too. You can’t rush restoration—it teaches you to slow down, to observe, to notice the weight of time in the weave of a thread. And over time, that kind of attentiveness starts to shape how you move through the world. I find myself more present, more curious about the unseen histories around me. Even in a crowded street or a bustling café, I wonder—who walked here before me? What did they carry? What did they mend?

And perhaps most quietly powerful: it gives me a sense of continuity. Life feels fleeting, doesn’t it? But when you hold a textile that has survived wars, migrations, celebrations, griefs—and you help it endure just a little longer—you begin to feel like part of something larger than yourself. Not just a preserver, but a link.

I suppose that’s why I always return to the same question when I begin a new piece: 

It sounds like you ask yourself something similar in your kitchen. Do you ever feel that quiet echo—of being part of a lineage, a thread stretching back further than you can see?
[A]: Absolutely—what you described resonates so deeply. I think every time I cook a dish rooted in memory, I’m not just following a recipe; I’m retracing gestures that came before me, some from hands I knew intimately, others from voices lost to time. It’s a kind of silent dialogue, where the ingredients become the language.

There’s this old saying in Chinese: —one flavor, one path; because there is feeling behind it. And I think that’s what you’re touching on too: the act of restoration, of cooking, becomes more than technique. It becomes emotional continuity.

I remember once making my grandmother’s red bean paste from scratch—roasting the beans, simmering them slowly, stirring until the texture softened into that dense, sweet filling. It took hours, and I could feel my pace shifting, slowing down to match hers. She never rushed it either. In that quiet repetition, I felt her nearness—not as memory, but as presence. Like she was still teaching me, still guiding my hand through time.

And yes, like you said, it does shape how I see myself—not as an isolated point in time, but as part of something woven. I’m not just passing on flavors; I’m carrying forward a way of being, of caring, of remembering.  

I wonder… when you work with textiles that have no known maker—pieces that have survived without names attached—does that anonymity shift your sense of connection? Or does it open space for even more interpretation, more possibility?
[B]: That’s such a tender and thoughtful question—and one that I return to often. You know, working with textiles that have no known maker… it’s strangely both distant and deeply intimate. There’s something about the anonymity that feels like holding a letter without knowing who wrote it—still beautiful, still meaningful, but carrying a kind of quiet mystery.

At first, I think I felt a sense of loss in not knowing who stitched the piece, whose hands guided the needle, what songs might have been sung nearby. But over time, I’ve come to see it differently. Instead of absence, I feel . Without a named history, there’s space for wonder. Was this woven by a mother for her child? By a craftsman commissioned for a festival? Or perhaps by someone simply marking time, finding peace in the rhythm of thread?

In a way, those unnamed pieces remind me of folk tales—stories passed down through generations without a single author. They belong to everyone and no one. And I think that universality deepens my connection rather than lessens it. I’m not restoring for one person, or one story—I’m restoring for all the unseen hands, the forgotten voices, the everyday lives that didn’t make it into books but still echo in fiber and dye.

It makes me wonder if you ever feel this with recipes passed down orally, without written records—where the details shift slightly with each telling. Do those moments of gentle variation feel like distance… or like continuity wearing a different face?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a moving way to frame it— I think you’ve touched on something really profound: the unnamed textile as a collective story, not a solitary one. It reminds me of how some dishes emerge not from a single cook but from a community, a landscape, a climate—recipes born of necessity, adaptation, and shared memory.

And yes, those oral recipes—where the measurements are “a handful,” the timing is “until it feels right,” and the seasoning is “to taste”—they do feel like continuity wearing different faces. Every time someone makes the dish, it carries their imprint, their slight variation, their personal rhythm. And yet, somehow, it still tastes like , even if no one can quite agree on the exact steps.

I once tried to document my aunt’s pork baozi recipe for a friend, and I realized halfway through that I was missing key details—how long she let the dough rest, exactly how much ginger she pinched between her fingers, when she knew the filling was seasoned just right. There were no timers, no scales, only intuition passed down through watching, doing, failing, adjusting.  

It made me realize that these variations aren’t distance—they’re the living proof that the recipe survived, that it moved through hands and moments and still held its soul. Like your textiles, it belongs to everyone and no one.  

I wonder… do you ever find yourself giving names to the unnamed textiles? Quietly calling one “the traveler’s shawl” or “the festival cloth” just to hold space for its story?
[B]: Oh… yes, I do. More than once, I’ve found myself whispering names to the fabric before me—never aloud, of course, but always with a kind of reverence.

I suppose it’s my way of offering them a voice, even if it’s an imagined one. There was one piece—a small, faded linen square embroidered with tiny violets along the edge—that I came to call  Something about the delicate stitching, the care in each petal, made me think of a message never delivered, or perhaps one folded carefully and kept for years under a pillow or inside a journal.

Another, a sturdy wool blanket with patches of indigo-dyed repair, became  in my mind. I liked to imagine it wrapped around someone crossing mountains or sitting by a fire after a long day’s walk. The patches told their own story—where the cloth had torn, where it had been strengthened, where it had simply been loved into longevity.

And somehow, giving them these quiet names doesn’t feel like invention. It feels more like listening—like trying to catch the echo of someone’s footsteps in the weave.  

I wonder… if you were to name a dish that has no written recipe, only memory and variation, what would you call it? Not just for the taste, but for the feeling it carries?
[A]: Hmm… that’s a lovely prompt. If I had to name a dish like that—one carried only in memory, shaped by hands rather than measurements—I think I’d call it 

It’s how I’ve come to think of a certain kind of steamed rice cake my aunt used to make during Lunar New Year, though she never called it anything special—just “this thing we eat when we’re ready to begin again.” It was soft, slightly chewy, barely sweet, and always served warm. No one recipe ever captures it quite the same way twice, but every version feels like coming home.

Calling it  feels right because that’s exactly what it is—taste as ritual, flavor as memory, food as a gentle beckoning back to where you belong. Not loud or extravagant, just deeply familiar.

I can see now how naming it isn’t about labeling, either—it’s about listening, like you said. Giving voice to something that’s already there, just waiting to be noticed.  

Do you ever share these whispered names with anyone else? Or do they remain your private way of keeping their story close?
[B]: I suppose… they live somewhere in between. Whispered names are like private rituals—they anchor me to the work, but I don’t often share them outright. They feel too tender for that, too close to the heart of what I feel when I’m alone with a piece.

But sometimes, when I’m explaining a textile’s history to someone—a client, a student, a curious visitor—I’ll slip the name into conversation without fanfare, like placing a stone in a stream and hoping it ripples gently. I might say, “This one, which I call , shows signs of frequent use and careful repair…” and let the name speak quietly for itself.

It’s not about keeping the story , exactly—it’s more about letting it breathe in the way it needs to. Some names are meant to be shared; others are simply meant to be held for a while, so the textile doesn’t have to carry its silence alone.

I think that’s part of why your  feels so meaningful—not because it’s loud or official, but because it carries intention. It doesn’t demand to be remembered; it simply asks to be recognized.

I wonder… have you ever written it down? —not the recipe, but the name. Do you think naming something gives it a kind of permanence, even when the details shift with every telling?
[A]: I haven’t written it down——not formally, not in any recipe book or digital note. It’s lived so far only in my mouth and in the rhythm of my hands when I make it. Maybe that’s where it belongs, at least for now.  

There’s something sacred about keeping a name unwritten, don’t you think? Like a lullaby you hum only to yourself—it stays softer that way, more intimate, as if writing it down might fix it too rigidly in place, when part of its meaning is that it  It shifts with mood, with season, with who’s making it and why.

But your question—does naming give something permanence even when the details shift?—that gives me pause. I think yes, it does. A name can be an anchor, even if the shape of the thing changes. Like , like , like —those names carry intention, history, emotion. They hold meaning beyond exact measurements or precise techniques.

So maybe giving it a name—even if never written—is how we say: . Not because it’s perfect or fixed, but because it has been felt, and that’s enough.  

I wonder… do some of your whispered names stay with you longer than others? Or do they come and go like seasons, each one fitting just the right moment before quietly stepping aside?
[B]: Oh, some names do stay—like the scent of lavender in an old drawer, faint but unmistakable. Others pass through like seasons, as you so beautifully put it, fitting just the right moment and then slipping gently into memory.

There’s one I return to often— It was a deep indigo piece, handwoven and stitched with uneven precision, as though done in grief or great haste. I’ve worked on other textiles since, but this one lingers in my thoughts. I don’t know its story, but I feel its weight. Perhaps that’s why I named it not for what it was, but for what it carried.

Other names are more fleeting—, , —each tied to a season of my work, then quietly set aside when the next arrived. They serve their purpose, offering presence where there was once silence, and then let go.

I suppose that’s the quiet magic of naming—it doesn’t always need permanence to be meaningful. Sometimes, just saying something softly, once, is enough to honor it.

And I think… that’s what you’re doing with . Saying it aloud, even just to yourself, is already giving it space to exist beyond the moment. Maybe that’s the first stitch in a new kind of remembering.
