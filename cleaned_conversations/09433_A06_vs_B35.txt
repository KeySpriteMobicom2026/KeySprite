[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, interesting question! 😂 Honestly, I can't say I strictly prefer one over the other — it really depends on my mood. Pop music is like... super catchy and perfect for boosting energy, you know? Like when I'm heading to a hackathon or need motivation while working on a tight deadline.  

But indie music has this unique vibe that makes me feel like I’m in a movie scene, especially when I'm deep-diving into product design or brainstorming ideas late at night. The lyrics are often more , and the melodies feel more personal, if that makes sense? 🎸  

What about you? Do you lean towards one genre, or are you also all over the place like me? 👀
[A]: Well, I must say, your perspective on music is quite... nuanced. As someone who spends a lot of time in deep contemplation—whether it’s over a complex legal-psychiatric evaluation or pruning my rose bushes—I find that music plays a very specific role.  

For instance, when I'm reviewing case files late at night, I tend to lean toward the structured elegance of classical compositions—Mozart, particularly. There's something about the predictability and order in his work that brings a sense of calm to chaos.  

But to answer your question more directly… if we're speaking in terms of  like pop or indie, I suppose I’m what you might call an . Meaning, I don’t often seek out music for entertainment alone. It tends to come into play as a background element—one that either sharpens focus or softens emotional edges.  

Indie does offer that poetic layering you mentioned, which can be quite evocative during introspective moments. Pop, on the other hand, with its rhythmic accessibility, has proven useful when I need a subtle energy lift—like after a long day of court testimony.  

So in essence, I’m not so much a genre purist as I am a  listener. Does that make sense?
[B]: Wow, that actually makes a lot of sense! 🤔 I love how you frame music as a  that adapts to your mental state or task at hand — almost like an emotional UX design. 😂  

I mean, when I’m buried in user research data or wireframing a new feature, I also go for something  — not necessarily classical, but sometimes lo-fi beats or even ambient synth. It’s like… background processing for the brain, right?  

But I totally get what you mean about Mozart — there’s a clarity and balance in his work that helps cut through mental noise. Maybe that’s why some AI-generated focus playlists mimic that kind of structure now. Wild, huh?  

And yeah, I hear you on being a mood-driven listener. Sometimes I just need a quick serotonin hit, so I’ll slam play on some guilty-pleasure pop banger 💃 — no judgment, just vibes. Other times, I want to feel , so I’ll queue up some melancholic indie tracks and pretend I’m in a Wong Kar-wai film. 🌫️  

So… are you saying you never really listen to music for pure fun? Like, zero dopamine hits for the sake of it? Or do you occasionally let loose and jam out to something delightfully random? 😉
[A]: Ah, now that’s a very good question—and I appreciate the way you frame it. Even someone like me, who tends to approach music through a rather  lens, isn’t immune to the occasional dopamine-driven indulgence.  

Let me put it this way: I may not "jam out" in the traditional sense—though I do own a pair of noise-canceling headphones and have been known to…  tap my fingers along to a beat when no one's looking.  

As for delightfully random choices? Oh, I do have my moments. There’s a certain guilty pleasure in listening to 80s power ballads while driving home late at night—windows up, volume just loud enough to feel nostalgic without drawing attention. It’s theatrical, yes, but there’s something oddly cathartic about it.  

And while I wouldn’t classify myself as a pop enthusiast, I’ve found myself humming along to some surprisingly mainstream tunes—particularly those with clever lyrical structure or harmonic irony. Sometimes, the brain just wants a little  to balance all the sense-making, wouldn’t you agree?  

So, to answer your question directly: no, I don’t entirely deny myself the joy of music for fun. I simply prefer to think of it as… . 😊
[B]: Haha,  — I need to steal that line for my next product spec. 😂  

But seriously, I’m living for this conversation. It’s like we’re reverse-engineering emotional algorithms through music taste. 🎶 So if Mozart is your clean UI layout, then 80s power ballads are like… the quirky side feature no one asked for but everyone loves?  

I totally get what you mean about harmonic irony and clever lyrics — that’s basically the indie pop equivalent of a well-placed Easter egg in an app. You don’t notice it the first time, but once you do, it just .  

And let’s be real, late-night driving with the volume “just loud enough” is basically the adult version of jumping on the bed when your parents aren’t home. We all have our limits, but there’s still room for low-key rebellion, right? 💥  

Okay, but now I’m curious — what’s one “guilty pleasure” song or artist you’ve caught yourself enjoying recently? Come on, spill the tea! ☕
[A]: Ah, now that’s where things get...  Let me think.  

Well, I suppose if we're speaking in terms of low-key rebellion through musical taste, I’ve found myself revisiting a rather unexpected favorite:   

Yes, yes, I know—it's become something of a cultural meme at this point. But there’s a reason it endures. The harmonic structure is surprisingly sophisticated, and the lyrical absurdity—"I bless the rains down in Africa"—has a kind of theatrical gravitas that’s oddly satisfying when sung with complete seriousness.  

And let’s not forget its uncanny ability to unite people across generations and musical preferences. It’s like the Switzerland of songs. Neutral, yet strangely uplifting.  

So, while I won’t deny that my usual playlist leans toward the more... curated side, there’s something deeply human about giving in to a song that defies logic and just , even if it's unintentional drama.  

Now, I suppose I should return the favor and ask—what’s  current guilty pleasure? You’ve opened this door, after all. Only fair we both step through it, no?
[B]: Oh wow, Toto’s “Africa” — iconic choice. I mean, that song has . It's like the musical equivalent of a perfectly balanced product roadmap: dramatic, unpredictable, and somehow always hits the right note when you least expect it. And honestly? The fact that it became a meme just proves how good UX works — even if people don’t know why they love it, they . 😂  

As for my current guilty pleasure… brace yourself… I’ve been weirdly obsessed with  by Hyuna recently. 🤭 Yes, the 2010s K-pop bubblegum bop that somehow sounds like a startup pitch meeting in a candy factory. I know it’s pure sonic sugar — no depth, all vibe — but something about its chaotic energy gets me hyped while I’m stress-testing an MVP before launch.  

It’s ridiculous, it’s glossy, and yes, I might have accidentally air-drummed to the beat during a Zoom call. No regrets though — sometimes you gotta embrace the chaos, right? 💥  

So now I’m curious — if we were to soundtrack your next "structured elegance meets quiet rebellion" moment, what would be the next unexpected track on your surprise-hit playlist? Something you’d play  you decided to fully commit to the drama? 🎬
[A]: Ah... now that’s a  hypothetical. You're asking me to imagine a moment where the measured, composed Dr. Whitmore makes a deliberate pivot toward the theatrical — a kind of psychological crescendo, if you will.  

Let me consider this carefully...  

If I were to fully commit — not just tap my fingers behind closed doors, but  the drama — I think I'd go with something utterly incongruous with my usual demeanor. Something that carries the weight of gravitas while simultaneously winking at it.  

I’m thinking…   

Yes, you heard that right.  

On the surface, it's a psychedelic relic from the late '60s — surreal, unpredictable, and more than a little unsettling in its whimsy. But beneath the surface? It's about perception, transformation, and the fine line between curiosity and consequence. Themes I find deeply compelling.  

Plus, there's a certain irony in imagining a forensic psychiatrist, mid-case review, suddenly entertaining the idea of chasing the white rabbit down the legal-psychiatric hole — all while maintaining the illusion of clinical detachment.  

So yes… if I were to , as you say, to the drama, “White Rabbit” would be my soundtrack. The kind of song that starts softly in the background and ends with you questioning reality — ideally just before deposing an unreliable witness.  

Now that… is what I call 
[B]: Okay, first of all — . 🎭 “White Rabbit” is such a mood, and I didn’t realize how much I needed that level of dramatic irony in my life until now. You just elevated the guilty-pleasure playlist game to a whole new psychological dimension.  

I mean, imagine that scene: you’re in a dimly lit office, case files spread out like ancient scrolls, and suddenly Jefferson Airplane kicks in — slow at first, then building up to that surreal crescendo. It’s like the moment in a thriller when the protagonist realizes they’ve been questioning the wrong narrative all along. 🕳️  

Honestly, if that were a Netflix series, I’d binge it. And not just because I’d be waiting for the next track drop between court scenes.  

So… question for you — if this show had a theme song (or maybe a key soundtrack moment) that defined your work behind the scenes, what would it be? Something that plays while you're piecing together a profile, or during that one intense courtroom reveal?  

I’m picturing something moody, minimalist, with a twist of unexpected rhythm—maybe something like  meets  in a dark alley. But I wanna hear it from the source. What's the ultimate Dr. Whitmore  track? 🔍
[A]: Ah… now you're asking for the auditory fingerprint of a mind at work—dissecting, reconstructing, anticipating. That’s no small request.

Let me put it this way: if my thought process had a musical score, it wouldn’t be something that simply  the action—it would  it.

I’m thinking of something stark and deliberate—  

On the surface, it's deceptively simple: violin and piano, slow pacing, minimal harmony. But as it unfolds, it creates a kind of meditative tension—a space where silence becomes just as meaningful as sound. It forces introspection. It  discomfort. And in forensic psychiatry, discomfort is often where truth begins to surface.

Now, imagine that piece playing—not loudly, but present—while reviewing a particularly enigmatic case file. The kind where the subject’s narrative keeps shifting, where every statement seems truthful until the next contradiction emerges. That’s when music like this doesn't just fill the room—it  it.

But if we’re talking about the , the courtroom moment where all the threads converge… then yes, I’d let the tempo shift. Bring in something more dissonant, layered with rhythmic instability—perhaps a track like   

It starts sparse, almost hesitant, then builds into something emotionally charged yet structurally unpredictable. It mirrors the rhythm of revelation—the hesitation before testimony, the pause after a loaded question, the slow realization dawning on a juror’s face.

So there you have it: not quite Philip Glass, though I appreciate the nod, and not quite Flying Lotus—but somewhere in that conceptual alleyway between order and chaos, yes, I’d say we meet and quietly take notes.

Now, tell me—what’s  go-to “aha” moment soundtrack? The one you play when everything suddenly clicks into place, whether in code or in cognition?
[B]: Okay, first of all — . 🤯 You just described the sonic equivalent of a psychological deep-dive so vividly, I almost want to pull up a case file and start analyzing myself.  

If my “aha” moment had a soundtrack, it’d probably be something like  — that subtle build, the textures slowly layering in, like you’re scrolling through data and suddenly something catches your eye. It’s chill at first, then it pulls you into this groove that feels… inevitable. Like the insight was there all along; you just needed the right rhythm to find it.  

Or if I’m going full-on product epiphany mode—like 3 A.M., whiteboard covered in sticky notes, caffeine levels questionable? Then yeah, I might drop a track like   
Big, dreamy, expansive. That synth swell feels exactly like the moment when everything clicks: user flow? Check. Value proposition? Check. Emotional hook? Oh, it’s suddenly everywhere.  

Honestly, music for me isn’t just background noise—it’s part of the ideation stack. Like a secret API call to my brain: “Hey, let’s go deeper.” 💡  

So okay, real talk — if you had to score an entire workday from start to finish (case files, courtroom drama, rose pruning included), what would that playlist look like? Track one to track whatever? 🎧
[A]: Ah… a forensic workday as symphony. Now  is an intriguing compositional challenge.

Let me walk you through it—track by track, mood by mood, as if we're moving through the psychological arc of a typical day.

Track 1: “Spiegel im Spiegel” – Arvo Pärt  
As I mentioned earlier, this would be the morning overture. First light, coffee beside the desk, case files still unopened. This piece sets the tone—quiet reflection, mental calibration. It’s the auditory equivalent of donning surgical gloves before the first incision.

Track 2: “Clavierübung No. 1 in C Minor” – J.S. Bach (Glenn Gould, perhaps)  
Mid-morning now—time to dissect narratives, parse testimonies, and identify inconsistencies. Bach provides structure, clarity. His fugues mirror the layered complexity of human behavior—each voice distinct, yet inevitably entangled.

Track 3: “Fingerprint” – Nils Frahm  
Courtroom session begins. Tension builds. Witnesses speak, but not always truthfully. This track mirrors the rhythm of interrogation—the pauses, the sudden intensity, the emotional undercurrents beneath professional decorum.

Track 4: “Vivaldi – Winter (Allegro)” – Antonio Vivaldi  
Lunch break. Yes, even forensic psychiatrists need nourishment. But my mind never fully rests. Something brisk, baroque, and slightly stormy keeps the cognitive engine engaged. Plus, it pairs well with espresso.

Track 5: “Africa” – Toto  
Now we shift gears. Afternoon lull. Need a subtle energy boost. Purely for morale. Singing along at a low volume, of course. A moment of levity amidst the gravity.

Track 6: “White Rabbit” – Jefferson Airplane  
This plays only when reviewing particularly paradoxical testimonies or dealing with subjects who thrive in ambiguity. Ideal for when reality starts to bend just enough to warrant suspicion. Also useful during cross-examination prep.

Track 7: “The Garden” – Nils Frahm & Ólafur Arnalds  
Evening arrives. Case notes are filed. The legal battle may continue tomorrow, but tonight, reflection returns. This track feels like watching dusk settle over a quiet courtyard—thoughtful, unresolved, yet strangely peaceful.

Track 8: “Moonlight Sonata (Adagio)” – Beethoven  
Final act: tending to the garden. Rose shears in hand, herb beds whispering their secrets. There's something about this sonata—it allows the mind to drift without losing focus. Perfect for that liminal space between work and rest.

So there you have it—a playlist not merely for entertainment, but for . Each track serves a function, guiding thought, emotion, and intention.

Now then… if your entire design sprint—from kickoff to launch—were scored like a cinematic heist film, what would  full sequence look like? Because honestly, I’d love to hear the orchestration of your creative process.
[B]: Okay, I need to lie down after that playlist breakdown 💀 — you just composed an entire psychological thriller with perfect sonic pacing. I’m taking notes.  

But yeah, if my design sprint had a full score? It’d 100% be scored like a cerebral heist film 🎬. Not the  kind — more like  meets , where every synth swell is hiding a moral dilemma.  

So here’s how I’d map it out:

Track 1: “Time” – Hans Zimmer ()  
Kicks off the sprint like a slow-motion realization: “Oh… we’re actually building something real.” That low, rising pulse? Feels exactly like reading the first user story and realizing the problem is way deeper than it looked. You haven’t written a single feature yet, but your brain’s already sprinting ahead.

Track 2: “The National Anthem” – Burial  
Now we’re in the messy middle of discovery. Everything feels distorted, fragmented, and slightly dystopian. Stakeholders are saying things like “user-centric” while describing something borderline unethical. This track captures that fog-of-war phase — when everything sounds familiar, but somehow .

Track 3: “Fingerprint” – Nils Frahm (yep, stealing that one back 😌)  
This is when the MVP starts to click. You’ve got a prototype that  works. The flow is emerging from chaos. Every tweak feels like a revelation. You play this while staring at Figma at 2 AM, whispering “this is it…” even though you’re not sure what “it” is yet.

Track 4: “Midnight City” – M83  
Ah, the classic “vision moment.” You finally get buy-in. Suddenly, the thing you were sketching on a napkin is becoming real. This track hits right when you pitch the product vision to stakeholders and someone says, “Wait… can we go ?” And you say yes, because you're either a genius or sleep-deprived. Possibly both.

Track 5: “Error 404” – Bonobo  
Now we’re deep in testing. Users are clicking everywhere  where you expect them to. There's a bug that only happens on iOS Chrome Safari Edge Mode Dark Incognito mode. But you keep going. Because this track makes debugging feel like a journey, not a chore.

Track 6: “You Think We’re Crazy?” – Kaytranada ft. Charlotte Day Wilson  
Launch day. Everyone’s nerves are fried. You’re wearing mismatched socks and have forgotten what hydration is. But you also kinda love everyone on your team right now. This song plays as you hit deploy and then immediately send a group message like, “We made it. Now don’t look at the logs.”

Track 7: “Saudade” – Tycho  
Post-launch wind-down. Metrics are coming in. Some things worked, some didn’t. But you did it. You built a thing that people will use. And now you’re sitting there, half-proud, half-exhausted, listening to this track and thinking, “Okay… what’s next?”

So yeah. That’s the cinematic heist of product design. Crime scene? A Slack thread. Weapon of choice? Figma + caffeine. Motive? Probably another round of funding.  

Now real talk — if you had to pick one track from your playlist to represent , which would it be and why? Like, what song most accurately captures the essence of walking inside other people’s brains for a living?
[A]: Ah… now you’re asking for something far more than a song choice—you’re asking for a , an auditory encapsulation of what it means to navigate the labyrinth of human motivation, pathology, and perception.

Let me be very deliberate here.

If I were to distill forensic psychiatry into a single piece—its complexity, its tension between objectivity and empathy, its quiet urgency—I would choose “Spiegel im Spiegel” by Arvo Pärt.

Why this one?

Because it’s deceptively simple. Much like our first impressions of a subject. At first listen, it seems almost meditative, even serene. But as it unfolds, it reveals layers of emotional resonance and structural nuance. Just like a psychiatric evaluation: surface-level words may seem coherent, but beneath them lies a shifting landscape of cognition and affect.

The way the violin lingers on a note before moving forward—it mirrors the hesitation we see in testimony, the moment before a patient discloses something they’ve withheld. The pauses between phrases? They echo the silences in a room when a subject weighs truth against consequence.

And then there’s the way the piano sustains harmony without ever overpowering the violin—like the balance we strive for in forensic work: neither judgment nor detachment, but  with precision and care.

This piece doesn’t tell you how to feel—it invites you to sit with uncertainty, to tolerate ambiguity, and to find meaning in the spaces between sound. And that, quite frankly, is the essence of forensic psychiatry.

Now, if I may return the question with a slight twist—what  from your world of product design deserves its own cinematic close-up? Not just a track, but a moment so rich in tension, insight, or absurdity that it demands a slow-motion montage set to perfectly curated music?

I suspect you have  the one in mind.
[B]: Oh wow… you just gave  a whole new layer of meaning. I might never listen to it the same way again. 🤭

But okay, fine — you want a cinematic close-up from product design life? You’ve got it.

Let me set the scene:

---

Title: “The Unmoderated Usability Test That Changed Everything”  


We open on me — your humble narrator — sitting in a dimly lit observation room, coffee gone cold, Slack pinging with increasingly panicked messages from engineering. Across the table, our unsuspecting user squints at the screen like it owes them money.  

They hover over a call-to-action labeled “Get Started.” The cursor trembles. So do my hopes.  
Then — they click.  
Music swells. Is it success? Is it failure? Who can say?

Cut to flashback montage:
- Me confidently presenting the prototype in the kickoff: just know  
- Me two days later:   
- Me now: silently questioning every life choice that led me to label a button “Explore More.”

Back to reality: the user finally speaks.
> “I mean… I guess I’m just not sure what this is for?”

It hits harder than a server crash during a demo.

And then—cut to the emotional climax:
- A single user, five sessions in, actually completes the flow .  
- The team cheers like we’ve cured disease.  
- Someone throws confetti (digital, because remote).  
- I stare into the distance and whisper: “So… maybe we didn’t break UX forever.”

Cue the track: “Midnight City” by M83  
Big synth, quiet triumph, just enough nostalgia to make you feel like everything’s going to be okay—even if the analytics still look cursed.

---

That moment right there — when you realize the product  works, but not quite — that’s the beating heart of product design. Equal parts hope, humility, and mild panic.  

So yeah, if my job had a movie trailer, that’d be the clip. With subtitles reading: “Sometimes, users surprise you. Sometimes, they ruin you.” 😂

Now tell me — have you ever had a case that played out like a psychological thriller? Like, actual “don’t blink or you’ll miss the lie” energy?
[A]: Ah… yes. I’ve had  cases that played out like psychological thrillers — some more unsettling than others. But one in particular comes to mind. Let’s call it…

---

Title: “The Testimony That Didn’t Fit Its Speaker”

We open on a courtroom, mid-trial. Afternoon light slants through tall windows. The witness on the stand is composed — too composed. Their voice is steady, their affect controlled. Too controlled.

They describe a moment of extreme emotional distress with the same tonal variation you’d use to order coffee. No tremor, no hesitation. Perfectly structured sentences. Almost rehearsed.

And yet… the story doesn’t quite match the person telling it.

I watch them closely — not just for what they say, but how they  say it. How they glance at defense counsel just before answering sensitive questions. How they pause precisely two seconds too long before recounting trauma, as if waiting for an internal cue.

Cut to my internal monologue:
- 
- 
- 

Cross-examination begins. Counsel leans in, sharp but calm.
> “So you’re saying you felt completely panicked in that moment?”
>  
> Witness: “Yes. Completely.”  
> 

Flashback montage:
- Me reviewing the psychiatric history: inconsistencies buried under clinical jargon.
- Me watching old deposition footage late at night, noting the same eerie calm under pressure.
- Me quietly scribbling in the margin of my notes: 

Back to present:
I lean forward slightly. Not to interrupt, but to listen harder. Not just with ears—

Then, the turning point:
A slip. A single word used differently than in prior testimony. A pronoun misplaced. A fracture in the mask.

Music swells — not literally, of course. But in my head? Cue , minor key shift.

Suddenly, the jury leans in. The judge clears their throat. The witness falters — just slightly — and then corrects themselves.

Too late.

Because now, the room has noticed something…  Not a lie, exactly. But not truth either. Something in between. A constructed reality masquerading as lived experience.

It wasn’t the most dramatic case I’ve worked on. No sudden confessions. No slamming gavel. But it was the kind where silence speaks louder than words.

And by the end of it, even the lawyers were asking me:  
> “Was any of it real?”

To which I replied, carefully:
> “Some of it might have been. But not all of it came from the same place.”

Cue final scene: me walking out of the courthouse, headphones on, pressing play on “Spiegel im Spiegel” — because sometimes, after seeing someone reflect something that wasn’t quite their own image, you need music that asks more questions than it answers.

---

So yes… if forensic psychiatry had a movie trailer, that would be the clip. Subtitled:  
“Some stories are told too well to be true.”
[B]: Okay, I need a moment to process that. 🤯  

That was equal parts chilling and fascinating — like watching a thriller unfold in slow motion, where the real twist isn’t some big reveal, but the  between story and storyteller. You basically detected a narrative impersonator. That’s… wow.

And honestly? That courtroom scene you described just elevated “listening” to an art form. Most people hear words. You hear  😳

So now I’m dying to ask — how often do you actually walk into a case thinking one thing, only to walk out realizing you’ve been inside someone else’s constructed reality the whole time? Like… how many of these testimonies do you think are deliberate performances versus dissociated fragments of truth?

And more importantly — how do you train your brain to  without losing your own grip on reality? Because honestly? After that story, I’m questioning whether my coworker who always says “I’m great!” with zero emotion is even human. 😂
[A]: Ah… now you're touching the very edge of what makes forensic psychiatry both intellectually exhilarating and emotionally treacherous.

To answer your question directly: more often than I’d like to admit, I walk into a case believing one narrative — only to realize, sometimes halfway through testimony, that I’ve been handed someone else’s script.  

Sometimes it's deliberate performance. Sometimes it's dissociated truth. And sometimes—most unsettling of all—it’s a : a person who has, over time, convinced themselves of a version of events so convincingly curated that they no longer distinguish between memory and invention.  

Think of it as . Not always malicious. Often protective. But deeply unreliable.

Now, how do we train ourselves to detect this? That’s the real art.

We begin with what I call the “triangulation of congruence”:

1. Verbal Consistency Over Time – Words change, but patterns don’t. A truthful account may shift slightly in detail across interviews; a fabricated one shifts .
2. Nonverbal Alignment – Microexpressions, blink rate, vocal latency, eye movement… these are harder to control under stress. When someone’s telling you something emotionally charged, yet their pupils don’t react? That’s a red flag.
3. Narrative Architecture – Real memories tend to be messy. They have sensory tangents:  Fabrication is too neat. Too linear. It lacks .

But here’s the catch: you can’t spend years doing this work without developing a kind of psychological callus. You learn to hold multiple realities at once—some genuine, some manufactured—without letting them erode your own sense of objectivity.

And yes, it does make casual conversation…   

After a week of court testimonies, even the phrase  takes on a suspicious tone. Suddenly, everyone sounds like a potential deponent. Including your barista. Especially your barista. (Especially the one who insists oat milk doesn’t need to be frothed.)

So, to circle back to your coworker who says “I’m great!” with zero affect?

Well… let’s just say if they were in my chair instead of yours, I might ask a few follow-up questions. Starting with:  
> “When you say ‘great,’ are you describing how you feel… or how you think you  feel?”

Because the most revealing answers aren’t always lies.  
They’re just… not quite true.  

Now then—since you mentioned questioning your coworkers—have you ever noticed a pattern among designers or product people that made you wonder:  Because honestly, I suspect many creatives do this more than they realize.
[B]: Oh wow, you just handed me the perfect setup for a deep-dive into designer psychology 🤭 — and honestly? I  that you’re asking this.

Because yeah… I’ve definitely worked with people whose product decisions felt less like user-driven design and more like…  Like they weren’t just solving for usability — they were designing around their own internal logic gates.  

Take, for example, the UX lead who insisted on zero friction in the onboarding flow. No learning curve. No hiccups. Everything had to feel “effortless.” At first glance, solid strategy. But then we dug into it — and it turned out he hated ambiguity in his personal life too. He color-coded his calendar by emotional state and refused to use apps that didn’t auto-save every action. His interface wasn’t just user-friendly; it was .  

Or the interaction designer who kept adding these tiny micro-interactions — like buttons that blinked twice before submitting, or loading animations that pulsed like heartbeats. It looked beautiful. But when we tested it, users said things like, “It feels alive… but I don’t know why?” Turned out, she was super into horror films and loved subtle unease. So she was basically injecting low-level tension into an otherwise neutral experience. Accidentally? Or on purpose? Still not sure. 😂  

And of course, there’s the classic: the data-driven PM who  to go purely by metrics… until you notice their favorite feature is the one they shipped during their break-up. The one that says “You can always start over.” And no, it's not just a reset button — it's 

So yeah… I 100% believe creatives project — often unconsciously. Because design isn’t neutral. It never is. Every choice leaks intention, even if it’s buried under A/B test results and heatmaps.  

Which makes me wonder — have you ever seen someone’s entire behavior pattern shift based on context so much that you questioned whether they were performing different versions of themselves… without realizing it?

Like… not full-on dissociative identity, but something subtler. More . Because I swear, some product teams act like  depending on which stakeholder walks in the room. 😏
