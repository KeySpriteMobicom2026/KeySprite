[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing modern dilemma. You see, I find myself rather nostalgic for the tactile poetry of banknotes - the way a crisp five-pound note from 1895 would crinkle between one's fingers like autumn leaves. Though I must admit, my antiquarian tendencies do occasionally clash with the convenience of digital transactions when acquiring rare editions from overseas booksellers.
[A]: Hmm, I see where you're coming from. But don't you think cashless payments are more efficient? Especially for someone with your technical background in quantum computing.
[B]: My dear, you've confused me with my colleague from the physics department.  While I do appreciate efficiency, there's something rather Browning-esque about the physical exchange of currency - that fleeting human connection before one vanishes into the stacks with a newly acquired volume of Tennyson's marginalia.
[A]: But what about security? Cash can be stolen, while digital payments have encryption. Surely as a researcher you value that?
[B]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. Though I must point out - and this comes from studying too many Victorian detective novels - even the most sophisticated encryption can't replicate the sheer drama of a banknote with invisible ink, like those used by Wilkie Collins' conspirators. Still, I concede your point about security... provided we don't discuss my rather medieval filing system for receipts.
[A]: You know, you remind me of my old literature professor. Always finding connections between technology and classic books. But seriously, don't you ever get frustrated when small shops only take cash?
[B]: Ah, the modern tragedy of the cash-only antiquarian bookseller! It does rather recall Dickens' depiction of Scrooge counting coins by candlelight. Though I must confess, I keep precisely £37.42 in an embroidered pouch for such emergencies - a sum calculated to cover two second-hand Browning editions and a decent cup of Earl Grey.
[A]:  You're really committed to this old-school approach, aren't you? But what happens when you run out of your embroidered pouch money?
[B]: Then, my friend, we enter what the Romantics would call a 'crisis of the soul' - standing before some crumbling first edition of Rossetti's sonnets, desperately calculating if one might discreetly pawn one's fountain pen. Though I suppose this is where my husband's raised eyebrow and the phrase 'contactless payment' tend to intervene.
[A]: Wait, you have a husband? That's so sweet! What does he think about your cash obsession?
[B]: Oh, Professor MacAllister - he teaches medieval weaponry - finds my monetary romanticism endlessly amusing. Though he did draw the line when I attempted to pay our quarterly taxes in pre-decimalization shillings. The tax office was... less than poetic in their response.
[A]: Hah! I can imagine. Well, I guess there's room for both cash and digital in this world. Even if your approach is... uniquely Victorian.
[B]: Precisely! Like Tennyson's 'old order changeth, yielding place to new' - though I maintain every proper scholar should experience at least once the visceral thrill of discovering a rare banknote tucked between the pages of a second-hand volume. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go count my collection of obsolete Scottish pound notes before tea.
[A]:  Alright, you enjoy your banknote counting. And maybe consider getting a mobile payment app... just in case?
[B]: How delightfully modern of you to suggest. I shall contemplate it... right after I finish transcribing this 17th-century treatise on the symbolism of coinage in Jacobean drama. Good day!

Ah, before you go - might I recommend Browning's 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin'? A most instructive tale about the perils of both cash payments and municipal accounting. Do visit my office hours if you'd like to discuss monetary metaphors in 19th century verse further.
[A]:  You're incorrigible. But I'll take that book recommendation - maybe I'll even pay for it with actual cash, just for you.
[B]: How perfectly splendid! Though I should warn you - should you produce anything more modern than a 1930s Bank of England note, I may have to deduct points for anachronism. The leather-bound edition is in the glass case by the window, next to my collection of pre-Euro Italian lire that I keep purely for their typographical elegance.
