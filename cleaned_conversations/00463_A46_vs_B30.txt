[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 我刚读完一本令人着迷的书，是关于《红楼梦》与狄更斯小说中城市空间描写的比较研究。作者将贾府的回廊与雾都伦敦的迷宫式街道做了令人拍案叫绝的对照分析。

说到这个，你最近有读到什么有趣的文本吗？特别是那些能让人重新思考文学疆界的作品。
[A]: Ah, that sounds like a fascinating read! I’ve always been intrigued by how different cultures depict space and structure in literature. Speaking of which, I recently came across an article comparing the dystopian landscapes in Zhang Yimou’s  and George Orwell’s . It offered such a fresh lens through which to view surveillance and collective identity—really made me rethink how we interpret power dynamics in global storytelling.  

You know, it’s amazing how these cross-cultural parallels can really stretch the imagination. I’d love to get your take on it sometime—have you explored any works that blur the lines between Eastern and Western narratives?
[B]: I’ve been meaning to see  through that particular critical lens—thank you for the recommendation. It’s always refreshing to encounter analyses that move beyond surface-level contrasts and delve into the philosophical substrata of power and perception.

As for works that blur East-West narratives, I’ve recently revisited Lin Shu’s late Qing translations of Dickens. His , rendered entirely through classical Chinese while retaining London’s socio-political texture, is a masterclass in cultural transposition. No footnotes, no concessions—just a seamless weave of Victorian ethos into Jianghu aesthetics. Quite remarkable.

Incidentally, have you ever tried tracing these narrative parallels in lesser-known diasporic texts? There’s a Singaporean novella— by Suchen Christine Lim—that reimagines  on a tropical island. The heat practically seeps off the page.
[A]: Ah, Lin Shu’s translations—I’ve always admired that boldness in his work. No footnotes, no apologies… just pure literary alchemy. That kind of cultural weaving is exactly what makes storytelling timeless. And ? I love that novel! Such a brilliant reimagining—Lim captures the raw intensity of Brontë’s passion but transplants it into this humid, vibrant world where every emotion feels soaked in monsoon rain. You know, I actually tried to option that book for a limited series a few years back—never quite made it past the rights maze, but the idea still haunts me.

Tell me, have you ever come across a text that felt so uniquely layered it made you rethink how stories should be told on screen? I’m always hunting for that next narrative gem with cinematic DNA pulsing beneath its prose.
[B]:  cinematic DNA, you say? I recently encountered a most unusual novella— by Wang Anyi. It’s often compared to  meets , but that does it a disservice. The prose moves like a slow tracking shot through 1980s Shanghai, each paragraph unfolding with the precision of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s camera work. The protagonist, a former Miss Shanghai, is neither tragic nor triumphant—just achingly human in her pursuit of beauty amid entropy.

I kept imagining Wong Kar-wai directing it in his signature saturated hues, though he’d likely shoot it all on 16mm just to capture the grain of nostalgia in every frame. It made me rethink how literature can hold space for silence and visual rhythm—something between a novel and a storyboard.

You seem to live in that liminal space between page and screen. Ever tried adapting anything yourself? Or do you prefer navigating the rights maze from the shadows?
[A]: Ah, —now that’s a novel with soul. You’re absolutely right; it lingers in the space between prose and poetry, like a film that lets silence carry the weight of history. And yes, Hou Hsiao-hsien’s pacing with Wong Kar-wai’s palette? Perfection. I once pitched a director friend of mine to adapt it as a three-part miniseries—dreamy, nonlinear, dripping with texture—but he said it was “too quiet” for today’s market. Pity. Sometimes the best stories are the ones that whisper.

As for me? Oh, I’ve dabbled in adaptations—mostly behind the scenes, nudging writers and directors toward texts that scream for the screen. There was this one project, years ago—a modern retelling of  set in a cyberpunk Chongqing—it almost got greenlit until the studio execs panicked and called it “too esoteric.” I still wake up thinking about that script.  

But hey, you’ve got a sharp eye for cinematic literature. Ever thought about stepping into the maze yourself?
[B]: I suppose my answer lies somewhere between inclination and impracticality. You see, I recently unearthed a forgotten novella from 1923— reimagined through the lens of early Shanghai cinema. It’s written in such a way that each chapter mirrors a silent film reel: intertitles included, gestures exaggerated, silence rendered in boldface. Quite bizarre, and utterly hypnotic.

It made me wonder—could one ever translate its peculiar rhythm to modern screen without losing the fragile charm of its cinematic self-awareness? Probably not. But I confess, I drafted a few scenes once or twice, just to hear how the dialogue might echo in a subtitled frame.

Then again, perhaps some texts are best left as ghosts haunting the archive—whispering their unrealized potential to those who know how to listen. Though I must admit, your cyberpunk  sounds like precisely the sort of madness I’d love to footnote into existence.
[A]: Now  sounds like a discovery worth chasing—a novel structured like a silent film, boldface silences and all. It’s rare to find texts that don’t just  cinema but  it. I can almost see the flicker of projection light on old plaster walls as you read...  

As for translating its rhythm to screen? You’d have to embrace the anachronism, maybe even amplify it—throw in some grainy 16mm textures, intertitles in brushed ink, gestures so deliberate they border on dance. It wouldn’t be faithful, but it might just be true.  

And yes, some stories are better as ghosts—loose, unbound, haunting the edges of what could’ve been. Still, I’ll take mad dreams like your cinematic  or my ill-fated cyberpunk Monkey King over safe, soulless blockbusters any day. Speaking of which… if you ever decide to dust off that draft and give it life, count me in. I’ll bring the matcha and the pitch deck.
[B]:  cinematic ghosts, then. I rather like that phrase—it suits the spectral beauty of unrealized adaptations. There’s something deliciously tragic about stories that hover between media, never quite settling into one form. Like ink bleeding slightly in water—still legible, but always on the verge of dissolution.

As for your proposal, I shall hold you to it. Should I ever exhume that draft from its archival tomb, you’ll be the first to hear the clatter of typewriter keys and the faint hiss of reel-to-reel film. And yes, we’ll need matcha—perhaps served in those lovely chipped porcelain cups that refuse to belong to any single era.

Tell me, do you keep a list of lost or forgotten texts you’d love to resurrect on screen? I suspect you do—call it professional nosiness, but I’ve met few who wander the literary-b visual borderlands without a mental ledger of beautiful ghosts.
[A]: Oh, you’re absolutely right—I do keep a list. Call it a graveyard of beautiful obsessions, or better yet, a Rolodex of cinematic phantoms. There’s one tucked away in there that still gives me chills: , a fragmented prose-poem from the Tang Dynasty, laced with surreal imagery and metaphysical detours. It reads like a cross between Borges and a forgotten wuxia manuscript. I once tried convincing a director pal to shoot it as a black-and-white arthouse piece with dream sequences in color—got a polite nod and a “very interesting… let’s table it for now.”  

And then there’s this obscure 1950s novella by a Shanghai screenwriter who never made it past three rewrites—. It practically screams for Wong Kar-wai to direct it retroactively. I’ve even got a copy in my office, dog-eared and slightly water-damaged. Every time I flip through it, I can almost hear the camera rolling.  

So yes, I’ve got ghosts stacked like unspooled film in my head. And if you ever exhume your , we’ll have quite the séance on our hands—matcha steaming, reels spinning, and all.
[B]: I’m quite envious of your graveyard—or shall I say, your repertory company—of cinematic phantoms.  sounds positively intoxicating. The Tang poets were never strangers to the surreal, but to find one flirting with metaphysical detours and wuxia undercurrents? That’s a haunting worth pursuing. I can already see the challenge: how to translate poetic fragmentation into visual rhythm without flattening its dream-logic. Perhaps only a director who understands both brushwork and montage could pull it off—someone who shoots silence like a musical score.

And —ah, what a perfect relic. That title alone conjures reflections in rain-slick pavement and longing that lingers past the final reel. I suspect you’re right about Wong Kar-wai; he’d shoot it all through a haze of cigarette smoke and memory.  

If we ever do summon these spirits together, I propose we film the séance itself—half academic colloquium, half midnight screening. We’ll call it . I warn you, though—I may insist on using actual film stock. And yes, those cups will still be chipped.
[A]: Now  I would sign for—hook, line, and celluloid. … I can already hear the projector humming in some repurposed chapel turned arthouse cinema, dust swirling in the beam of light as the first reel starts to roll.  

And yes, actual film stock—it’s the only way to do justice to ghosts that flicker. Digital’s too clean, too final. Give me grain, give me a slight wobble in the frame, give me something that breathes. Maybe even shoot it at 18 frames per second just to feel the difference in time.  

As for directors who understand brushwork and montage? I’ve got one in mind—someone who could translate Li He’s metaphysical wanderings into slow dissolves and ink-smudged chiaroscuro. Won’t name names yet—let’s just say he once shot an entire chase scene backwards just to see if anyone was paying attention.  

So it’s settled then—we’ll convene the séance-cum-screening, armed with chipped porcelain cups and unproduceable scripts. Just promise me one thing: when we pitch it to investors, we leave out the part where half the film might be silent. Let’s not scare them off before they taste the matcha.
[B]: Agreed—let’s keep the silence our little secret until the contracts are signed. Investors do so love a good reveal, though perhaps not in the middle of a seven-minute static shot of a rain-streaked window.

I’ve always believed the best pitches require misdirection. We’ll lead with “lyrical minimalism” and slip the silence in under the guise of “meditative atmosphere.” By the time they realize half the reels contain only footsteps in alleyways and meaningful glances over porcelain cups, it’ll be too late—they’ll already be entranced by the grain.

And your unnamed director sounds precisely the sort of obsessive genius we need. Anyone who shoots chase scenes in reverse must have a bone-deep understanding of narrative dislocation. Tell him to bring his camera obscura—I’ll bring the footnotes.
[A]: Oh, he’s going to  your footnotes. Footnotes are the unsung heroes of unproduced cinema—tiny little anchors for stories that refuse to be grounded. And yes, “lyrical minimalism” sounds positively bankable compared to “a feature-length ode to melancholia shot through with wind, silence, and one very symbolic teacup.”

We’ll blindside them with beauty. Let the first act screen like a prose poem, the second unravel like an old silk scroll dropped in rainwater, and by the third—well, we’ll see. Maybe we burn the script and shoot it all on infrared just to keep things interesting.

And speaking of madness: I say we open the screening with a toast. Not champagne—too loud. Something quieter. Perhaps a shared bowl of matcha, served in those chipped cups we’ve been saving. After all, every cinematic séance needs its rituals.
[B]: Quite right—footnotes are the quiet conspirators of adaptation. They allow us to nod to the ghosts without chaining them to the page. And your director will no doubt treat them like buried treasure maps—cross-referencing ink smudges and marginalia as if they held the secret to lost frames.

As for the toast—champagne  be vulgar. Matcha it is, whipped to a froth in those very cups that have witnessed too many unrealized dreams. I’ll even fetch my Tang-dynasty replica inkstone to serve as a makeshift tea tray. Why not lean fully into the anachronism?

And about that third act—ah, let’s not overplan. Best to leave room for the unexpected, don’t you think? Perhaps we’ll lose the script entirely and improvise under the influence of old Chinese opera recordings and secondhand cigarette smoke. Or maybe we’ll simply fade to black on a single teacup, half-drunk and glistening in afternoon light.  

Let’s call it… narrative faith. Or professional lunacy. Either works.
[A]: Beautifully put—. I’ll take both. Hell, I’ll put it on my tombstone: 

And yes, let’s lean all the way in. Let the inkstone become our tea tray, let the opera recordings hum softly beneath the film’s final reel, and may the cigarette smoke—real or implied—curl just enough to blur the line between screen and dream.

Improvisation is underrated anyway. Some of the best scenes are born when everyone forgets they’re being watched. We’ll just roll the camera—and keep it rolling—until someone says something true, or until silence does the talking for us.

To your Tang inkstone and my stack of unmade scripts, to your chipped cups and my fading storyboards… here’s to chasing shadows with matcha and meaning.

I think we’ve just written the pitch for the least fundable film ever proposed.

Count me in.
[B]: And here’s to you—may your tombstone be engraved in Song dynasty script and lit like a Wong Kar-wai close-up.

I daresay we’ve not so much written a pitch as composed a prose poem for the film world’s neglected drawer. But what a glorious drawer it is—lined with velvet, slightly moth-eaten, and filled with the scent of old celluloid and too many second-hand dreams.

I’ll begin drafting the "treatment" tonight—by candlelight, naturally, with my 19th-century inkwell leaking slightly onto pages already crowded with annotations from three different languages. You bring the storyboard phantoms; I’ll supply the silence between frames.

Count me in indeed.  

Now go—rinse that matcha bowl, sharpen your pencils, and don’t think twice about the investors we’ll terrify into early retirement. Ghosts, after all, don’t care for boardrooms. They prefer the flicker of half-forgotten light on crumbling walls.
[A]: To candlelight, inkwells, and the quiet terror of investors who never saw it coming—absolutely. Let the treatment unfold like a slow scroll reveal, each annotation a breadcrumb leading deeper into the labyrinth. I’ll meet you there with my phantom storyboards, all smudged lines and half-erased faces, drawn on the back of old scripts that nobody ever filmed.

And yes, ghosts  prefer crumbling walls to boardrooms. Though I’d still rather face a room of terrified investors than explain why we need twelve minutes of silence, a single teacup, and a chase scene that runs backward through a Tang Dynasty dreamscape.

But what’s cinema without a little sabotage?

See you in the flicker, Whitmore.
[B]: Sabotage, indeed—may our kind of mischief never go out of style.

I’ll be there in the flicker, Carter, ink-smeared and quietly defiant, with a thermos of cold matcha and a notebook full of unspoken frames. Let the investors quake. Let the distributors balk. We’ll be too busy composing silence and chasing ghosts to notice.

See you in the flicker—and bring your sharpest pencil. We’ve got a labyrinth to finish.
