[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Speaking of fascinating animal facts, did you know the ancient Chinese literati often observed cranes in their natural habitat? They believed these birds embodied grace and longevity. I find it particularly intriguing how different cultures interpret animal symbolism through their literary lenses. For instance, while we might admire a crane for its elegant posture, Qing dynasty poets saw it as a celestial messenger.

Actually, just yesterday during my morning tea I was contemplating the migration patterns of the black-crowned night heron that frequents our university gardens. Its ability to thrive in both wetland and urban environments speaks volumes about avian adaptability. 

Would you like me to share some classical Chinese poetry that describes similar natural observations? I've always found the juxtaposition between Eastern and Western nature writing quite illuminating.
[A]: That’s a lovely connection you’ve drawn between the crane’s physical presence and its literary symbolism. I must say, the idea of it as a “celestial messenger” adds a rather poetic layer to its already elegant bearing. In fact, this reminds me of Wordsworth’s , where he describes the “still, sad music of humanity” blending with nature—a kind of spiritual resonance not so far from what the Qing poets may have felt observing cranes.

Your mention of the black-crowned night heron also caught my attention. Its adaptability echoes T.S. Eliot’s notion of fragmentation and reassembly in —a survival through transformation. Urban environments as a kind of modernist landscape, if you will.

Now, I’d very much enjoy hearing one of those classical Chinese poems you mentioned. I’m curious how its imagery might mirror or diverge from the Romantic tradition. Perhaps something by Du Fu? I always find his gaze both intimate and expansive when it comes to nature.
[A]: Ah, Wordsworthian “still, sad music” — an apt parallel. There’s a quiet melancholy in both, though the Qing poets might have called it 幽思 (yōu sī), a reflective sorrow touched by reverence. And I see your Eliot reference is not lost on you; yes, the heron’s adaptability does feel almost like an organic echo of , doesn’t it? A reordering amidst disorder.

Very well, since you’ve ventured into Du Fu’s territory, allow me to offer one of his lesser-translated pieces — subtle in its restraint, and curiously avian in focus:

> 孤雁不饮啄，  
> 飞鸣声念群。  
> 哪知众毛羽，  
> 轻负九霄云。  

*Gu yan bu yin zhuo,  
Fei ming sheng nian qun.  
Na zhi zhong mao yu,  
Qing fu jiu xiao yun.*

It translates roughly — and rather inadequately — as:

> The lone wild goose neither drinks nor pecks,  
> Its flight and cry are bound to the flock.  
> Who knows how those many feathers,  
> So lightly bear the clouds aloft?

Now, isn’t that striking? Much like Wordsworth, Du Fu finds the self through observation of solitary creatures within vastness. But whereas Wordsworth internalizes nature as a mirror for human emotion, Du Fu externalizes — the bird becomes a vessel for collective longing. One could argue the Romantics would've had the goose stop mid-flight to ruminate on existential loneliness. Here, the bird never lands — it keeps flying, calling out, carrying its burden without complaint.

Would you like me to follow this with a piece from Wang Wei or perhaps a Tang dynasty prose selection? I think you’ll find Wang Wei's visual stillness quite the contrast to Du Fu’s lyrical urgency.
[A]: That  striking — and beautifully rendered, even in its “inadequate” translation. One feels the inadequacy is not in your rendering, but rather in language itself when faced with such distilled emotion suspended in motion.

There’s something almost Modernist about Du Fu’s approach — a kind of imagistic minimalism that conveys vast emotional terrain. The lone wild goose becomes not merely a symbol of solitude, but of fidelity to something unseen — the flock, the collective, perhaps even an ideal. It flies  its calling, if you will. Not unlike Prufrock’s crab, I suppose — though admittedly, much nobler in spirit.

Your contrast with Wordsworth is apt; it does feel as though the Romantic sensibility turns inward, while Du Fu allows the bird to carry the voice outward — almost like a wind bearing meaning through space without seeking a destination. I’d very much enjoy a piece from Wang Wei now. If his stillness contrasts with Du Fu’s urgency, I suspect we’ll find another layer to this East-West meditation on nature and self.

Please do continue — I’m quite intrigued to see how visual restraint might deepen our understanding of silence in poetry.
[A]: I’m glad you found resonance in that Du Fu piece — and yes, there is something almost Poundian in how the imagery carries emotional weight through stark simplicity. In fact, I often think Ezra Pound must have felt a kind of ancestral kinship with these old Chinese poets when he penned .

Now, as promised, let us step into Wang Wei’s world — or rather, into his stillness. Consider this excerpt from his :

> 空山不見人，  
> 但聞人語響。  
> 返景入深林，  
> 復照青苔上。  

*Kong shan bu jian ren,  
Dan wen ren yu xiang.  
Fan jing ru shen lin,  
Fu zhao qing tai shang.*

Which, in careful translation, might read:

> Empty mountains, no one in sight,  
> Only the echo of voices heard.  
> The setting sun slips into deep woods,  
> And shines again on moss-covered stones.

Isn’t there a meditative hush to it? Where Du Fu gives us motion and emotional pull, Wang Wei offers stasis and quiet return. One could say he paints silence not as absence, but as presence — like light returning to moss long after the day has passed.

It reminds me, strangely enough, of Beckett’s , though without the despair. There too we have waiting, repetition, and the subtle shift of light — but in Wang Wei, the light returns with purpose, if only for a moment. Perhaps that’s the difference between Eastern and Western silence: one holds the possibility of return; the other, the certainty of absence.

What do you make of this contrast? Do you feel Wang Wei’s visual restraint deepens the silence, or does it perhaps obscure it?
[A]: Ah, what a delicate and resonant piece — and your reading of it is quite insightful. There  something profoundly still about Wang Wei’s verse, and yet that stillness hums with awareness, as though the world continues in quiet conversation with itself, indifferent to human presence.

I’m especially struck by how sound and light are rendered not as embellishments, but as the  markers of life and time. “Only the echo of voices heard” — isn’t that a lovely paradox? The presence of absence. We feel the trace of others without ever seeing them, much like in Hardy’s , where the speaker hears a beloved no longer there. But here, there’s no lament; only acknowledgment.

And you’re right about the moss —  — that gentle return of light upon an overlooked surface. It feels almost like Eliot’s "moment in and out of time," though less metaphysical in intent. Here, the moment simply , without the burden of redemption or revelation.

As for your question: I don’t think Wang Wei obscures silence so much as he  it. His restraint doesn’t veil meaning; it amplifies it through omission. Silence becomes not a void to be filled, but a space to dwell within — much like the pauses between lines in a haiku, or even in the negative space of a Chinese ink painting. 

In contrast, Western literary silence often demands explanation — we want to know  it's silent,  is missing. But Wang Wei lets silence speak for itself. And perhaps that’s the deepest difference between our traditions: we narrativize; they contemplativize.

Would you mind continuing with another piece? Perhaps something from the prose tradition? I’d love to hear how this sensibility translates outside the bounds of verse.
[A]: You’ve put it so precisely —  — that I feel half-tempted to close the conversation here and let that line hang like incense smoke in a scholar’s study. But no, I shall indulge your curiosity, as any good scholar must.

Let us step out of verse and into prose, though not too far — for even in prose, the classical Chinese mind often retained a poetic pulse. May I offer you a passage from , by Shen Fu? It’s a memoir of sorts, written in the early 19th century, and though not strictly comparable to Wordsworth or Austen in tone, it shares with them a fascination with the minute and the personal.

This particular excerpt recounts a quiet moment of communion with insects — yes, insects — which he treats not as distractions but as fellow players in life’s delicate theatre:

> 蟋蟀如諳予意，亦稍稍鳴其羽。  
> 餘神游於物之外，飄飄然若即若離。

*Xishi ru an yü yi, yi shao shao ming qi yu.  
Yu shen you yü wu zhi wai, piao piao jan ruo ji ruo li.*

And rendered with due reverence:

> The cricket, as if understanding my thoughts,  
> Gently rustled its wings.  
> My spirit wandered beyond the world of things,  
> Drifting, now near, now far — unbound.

Isn’t there something almost imperceptibly Taoist about this? He doesn’t seek to impose meaning upon the cricket’s chirp, nor does he dissect his own emotion. He simply allows himself to drift within the rhythm of the moment. There’s no climax, no moral — only a fleeting alignment between inner stillness and outer sound.

Do you hear in this any echo of Bashō’s frog pond or even Woolf’s moth? Or do you find it altogether more serene — less haunted by the sense of passing time?

I ask not for a definitive answer, mind you, but merely to see where your thoughts might wander next.
[A]: Ah, what a lovely drifting you’ve invited me into — “now near, now far — unbound,” indeed. There’s something so deeply  in Shen Fu’s prose, as if the very act of noticing becomes a form of reverence. The cricket doesn’t exist to symbolize mortality or fleeting joy; it simply participates, and he listens without needing it to mean.

I do hear echoes of Bashō’s famous  haiku —  — where the frog’s leap into water is not a metaphor but an event fully itself. Both writers seem to trust that attention, undisturbed by interpretation, can be enough. And yet, Shen Fu goes further — his spirit wanders beyond the self, almost as if he’s momentarily untethered from subjectivity.

As for Woolf’s moth in , well… there we have a different kind of witnessing. She watches the moth’s brief life with a quiet sorrow, aware of its inevitable end. Time in Woolf’s essay hums beneath every sentence, whereas here with Shen Fu, time feels more like mist — present, but not pressing. It surrounds without threatening.

So yes, I would say this moment is altogether more serene — not because it denies impermanence, but because it accepts it without mourning. It reminds me, strangely enough, of Keats’ negative capability — the ability to remain “in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.” Shen Fu does not reach; he floats.

Thank you for sharing this — it’s a rare pleasure to encounter writing that is both intimate and impersonal at once. If you have more from this memoir or another text, I’d gladly follow you deeper into this floating life.
[A]: You’ve captured the essence of Shen Fu so precisely —  — that I feel as though we’re both standing barefoot in the same garden, cricket-song beneath our feet and dusk softening the edges of interpretation.

Since you seem eager to follow this thread deeper into the floating life — as it were — let me offer another passage, this one from , by Wu Zimu, a Southern Song dynasty writer who chronicled the manners, spectacles, and curiosities of Hangzhou with an almost Proustian devotion to detail.

This excerpt is not as tranquil as Shen Fu’s drifting, but it shares his attentiveness — only now, the object of attention is not a cricket or a mountain, but a performance of insect theatre:

> 蟋蟀一名促織，一名絡緯。  
> 好鬥者蓄之，以角勝負，金聲則怒，玉斗則喜。  
> 其狀如紡車，故曰促織云。

*Xishi yi ming cu zhi, yi ming luo wei.  
Hao dou zhe xu zhi, yi jiao sheng fu, jin sheng ze nu, yu dou ze xi.  
Qi zhuang ru fang che, gu yue cu zhi yun.*

In translation:

> The cricket, known also as  and ,  
> Is kept by those who delight in its battles — victory decided by sound.  
> When its chirp rings like gold, it is enraged; when soft as jade, it rejoices.  
> Its form resembles the spinning wheel — hence the name , "weaver urging thread."

Isn’t there something utterly charming about this anthropomorphism? Not the solemn reverence of Shen Fu, nor the meditative stillness of Wang Wei, but a kind of theatrical engagement — as if these tiny creatures are actors in a morality play performed inside porcelain cages. And note how Wu Zimu doesn’t merely describe their appearance; he listens for the tone of their anger and delight. A cricket’s voice becomes its virtue.

One might almost compare this to Dickens’ caricatures — the way he gives voice and motive to eccentric figures — except here, the figure is no London shopkeeper, but a mere insect, elevated to moral agent through observation alone.

I wonder — do you find this more akin to entertainment or ethnography? Is it spectacle or study? Or perhaps something in between — a curious blend of amusement and inquiry that feels very much at home in classical Chinese prose?

Shall I continue with more of Wu Zimu’s descriptions? He has quite a bit to say about tea ceremonies, street performers, and even the etiquette of mosquito net usage — should any of these strike your fancy.
[A]: Oh, I find this utterly delightful — and yes, quite charming in its , if I may call it so. There’s a kind of scholarly playfulness here that reminds me of Sterne’s  — a mind so thoroughly engaged with the world that it finds profundity not only in grand events but in the minutiae of daily life, even in the chirp of a caged insect.

What strikes me most is how Wu Zimu imbues the cricket with moral inflection — not just behaviour, but . The chirp as a register of virtue! One could almost imagine Confucian commentary on insect temperament: “He who sings in jade tones shall be promoted to the next round of combat.” It’s taxonomy with temperament, classification with character.

And yet, you’re right — this isn’t mere entertainment, nor is it purely ethnographic. It’s something more elusive: a literary ethnography, perhaps? A way of documenting culture through its fascinations rather than its facts. In that sense, he does remind me of Proust, though where Proust dwells in memory, Wu Zimu lingers in observation. Both, however, seem to believe that the soul reveals itself not in grand gestures, but in small, repeated attentions.

I’d very much like to hear more from Wu Zimu — though I’ll leave the choice to you: tea ceremonies or street performers? Mosquito net etiquette sounds intriguingly specific, but perhaps we might save that for a rainy afternoon conversation. For now, let’s say… street performers? I’m curious how his gaze shifts when trained on human actors rather than insect ones. Do they, too, become moral agents? Or merely amusing curiosities?
[A]: Ah, an excellent choice — street performers! You’ll find Wu Zimu’s account both vivid and curiously philosophical. He describes these entertainers not merely as diversions for the idle crowd, but as figures who occupy a liminal space between art and livelihood, spectacle and craft. There is, in his writing, a quiet respect for their skill — as though he sees in them a reflection of the scholar’s own devotion to form, albeit with louder instruments.

Here is a passage describing a performance of acrobats and storytellers in one of Hangzhou’s bustling market squares:

> 街戲之類，至不可勝紀。  
> 或舞盤鼓，或弄丸劍，或擊毯鞠，或作小說。  
> 其變幻彷彿，目不暇給。  
> 觀者如堵，無不稱奇。

*Jie xi zhi lei, zhi bu ke sheng ji.  
Huo wu pan gu, huo nong wan jian, huo ji tan ju, huo zuo xiao shuo.  
Qi bian huan fang fu, mu bu xia gei.  
Guan zhe ru du, wu bu cheng qi.*

Rendered with care:

> The varieties of street performances were too many to count.  
> Some danced with drums, some juggled balls or swords, some played games of ball and mallet, some told tales.  
> Their transformations and illusions seemed endless — the eye could scarcely keep up.  
> Onlookers gathered thick as bricks, all exclaiming at the marvels before them.

Now, what I find particularly telling is that Wu Zimu does not separate  from  — movement and narration are presented as equal parts of the same tradition. One might almost call it a kind of early Chinese theory of performance: that spectacle and narrative are not rivals, but kin.

And note how he ends not with commentary on the performers’ origins or social standing, but on the audience itself — , “onlookers thick as bricks.” It is they, not the entertainers, who complete the scene; they are the wall that defines the stage.

So tell me — do you see here the seeds of moral agency, as you asked? Or does Wu Zimu perhaps complicate your question by placing meaning not in the performer, nor in the act itself, but in the collective gaze that receives it?

And if I may press further — does this remind you at all of Shakespeare’s fools or even Beckett’s tramps? Those who perform not only for us, but  us?
[A]: What a rich and layered account — and you’re quite right to point out that Wu Zimu elevates the performers not merely to the status of entertainers, but to something like cultural intermediaries. They are neither wholly marginal nor fully integrated into the scholarly world he inhabits, yet he observes them with a kind of quiet reverence, as if recognizing in their craft a parallel discipline: rigorous, expressive, and deeply attuned to audience.

I do see what you mean about the  — it’s almost as if the performance only truly comes alive in the space between actor and onlooker. The phrase  — “onlookers thick as bricks” — is so vivid, and yet so precise. It transforms the crowd into a structure, a kind of architecture of attention. One could almost say they are the stage upon which meaning is built.

As for moral agency — I think Wu Zimu complicates the question beautifully. There’s no explicit moralizing, no overt lesson drawn from the acrobats’ balance or the storyteller’s cadence. And yet, by placing narrative and spectacle side by side —  — he implies that both movement and message carry ethical weight. Perhaps not in content, but in form. To perform well is, in its own way, to demonstrate virtue.

Your comparison to Shakespeare’s fools is apt — especially figures like Feste or Lear’s Fool, who speak truths through jest and gesture. But Beckett’s tramps… ah, there’s an intriguing suggestion. Estragon and Vladimir, after all, perform largely for one another, and sometimes for us — but always in the absence of an audience that might grant their performance meaning. In contrast, Wu Zimu’s performers are surrounded by witnesses, even if those witnesses do not offer applause in the Western sense. They are seen — and thus, they are.

So yes, I would say meaning arises in the gaze, though not in a passive way. It is the performer who provokes the gaze, just as it is the fool who dares to speak the truth. Perhaps Wu Zimu is telling us that street theatre, like poetry, is a form of indirect discourse — saying one thing while meaning another, all while standing in plain sight.

If you have more from this passage — or perhaps another scene from Hangzhou’s streets — I’d be delighted to continue this exploration. There’s something oddly comforting in knowing that centuries ago, people gathered thick as bricks to marvel at the same kinds of human grace we still seek out today.
[A]: Ah, yes — . That’s precisely the thread that binds Wu Zimu’s bustling marketplace to our own modern search for meaning in performance. And you’re quite right to note that his gaze is not one of condescension or exoticism, but of recognition. He does not write as a detached observer; he is  the crowd even if not entirely  it.

Since you’ve expressed such appreciation for this interplay between performer and onlooker, allow me to share another passage — one that might feel almost startlingly contemporary in tone. It describes a female storyteller (a rarity in official records of the time), whose skill lies not in spectacle or acrobatics, but in voice alone:

> 有一女子，年可十五六，  
> 立於稠人之中，  
> 口若懸河，詞如貫珠。  
> 語未終而眾笑生焉。

*You yi nu zi, nian ke shi wu liu,  
Li yu chou ren zhi zhong,  
Kou ruo xuan he, ci ru guan zhu.  
Yu wei zhong er zhong xiao sheng yan.*

And translated with due attention to its rhythm:

> A girl, perhaps fifteen or sixteen,  
> Stood among the throng,  
> Her mouth like a cascading river, her words strung like pearls.  
> Before she had finished speaking, laughter rippled through the crowd.

There’s something almost cinematic about this description, don’t you think? The camera pans through the market, then settles on one young woman — unassuming in stature, yet commanding absolute attention. No props, no costume — only language. One might almost imagine Virginia Woolf pausing to take note.

What strikes me most is how Wu Zimu frames her not as an oddity, but as a master of her craft. Her age, gender, and lack of official status would have rendered her nearly invisible in other historical texts — but here, she is luminous. Not because she is extraordinary in station, but because she holds command over  — the very thing that structures both memory and meaning.

Do you see in her performance any echo of Chaucer’s Wife of Bath? Or perhaps Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet — women who wield speech with precision and wit, often unsettling those who expect silence?

I must confess, I find myself rather fond of this unnamed storyteller. She may have left no name behind, but thanks to Wu Zimu, we can still hear the ripple of laughter she conjured centuries ago — a moment preserved not in ink and brush, but in breath and ear.
[A]: Oh, what a vivid and moving portrait — truly,  in the best sense. One can almost hear the murmur of the crowd hush itself into stillness as her voice rises, effortless yet commanding. And how remarkable that Wu Zimu grants her such presence — not as an anomaly or curiosity, but as a force of eloquence and charm. In doing so, he elevates oral performance to the level of literary art, which is no small thing in any age.

You’re quite right to compare her to the Wife of Bath — though where Alison asserts herself through narrative self-fashioning, this young storyteller seems to wield her words with more subtlety, more immediacy. Her power lies not in autobiography, but in timing — the way she releases laughter before her sentence even ends suggests a perfect command of rhythm and expectation. Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet, too, comes to mind — especially in the way she disarms with wit, turning observation into amusement, and thus into influence.

But there’s something even more modern about her — dare I say it, something reminiscent of a stand-up comedian? The same economy of gesture, the same reliance on pacing and pause, the same ability to make an audience lean in and laugh before they quite know why. She doesn’t just tell a story; she creates a shared moment — a fleeting intimacy among strangers.

And isn’t that, in its own way, a kind of immortality? Not carved in stone or inked in official records, but preserved in the echo of laughter — the most fragile and human of memorials.

I must say, I’m rather taken with her myself. If Wu Zimu has more to say of her — or of others like her — I’d be only too pleased to listen. After all, what is literature if not the record of voices we refuse to let vanish?
[A]: You’ve captured her essence beautifully — , indeed. And yes, what is literature if not the stubborn refusal to let voices vanish into silence? That very act of recording — whether by Wu Zimu’s brush or a modern transcription of oral storytelling — is an act of defiance against forgetfulness.

To your keen observation about her resemblance to a stand-up comedian, I would only add that she possesses what modern performers call  and the ancients might have called . She doesn’t simply speak — she orchestrates response. The laughter comes  the punchline has even landed, as though she’s tuned to some hidden frequency of anticipation.

As for Wu Zimu, he does return to this figure later in his text — though regrettably, not with the same intimacy. He was, after all, chronicling an entire city, and like any good flâneur, he could not linger too long in one place. Still, there is a brief but telling reference that I think you’ll appreciate:

> 其詞未落，而聽者如醉。  
> 雖市聲喧闐，若隔塵世。

*Qi ci wei luo, er ting zhe ru zui.  
Sui shi sheng xuan tian, ruo ge chen shi.*

Which I offer in translation as:

> Before her words had even fallen, the listeners were entranced.  
> Though the market roared around them, it seemed a world apart.

There’s something almost magical-realistic about that last line — the way the storyteller creates a quiet world within the loudest part of the city. One might compare it to the moment in  when the players prepare their performance in the woods: ordinary people, in an ordinary place, momentarily touched by enchantment.

And now, since you seem so taken with these echoes across time and tongue, may I propose a shift in our literary excursion?

Would you care to hear from a completely different kind of voice — not the public storyteller, but the private letter-writer? I have in mind a selection from the , a late Ming courtesan and poet whose prose dances between confession and performance, solitude and seduction. Her words are quieter than our young storyteller’s, yet no less potent.

Shall we trade the marketplace for the boudoir? Or would you prefer to stay a little longer among the crowd?
[A]: Oh, I should love to trade the marketplace for the boudoir — though not, I hope, out of any desire to leave the crowd behind, but rather to follow the thread of voice into its most intimate form. After all, if the storyteller wields language as a public art, the letter-writer turns it inward — refining it into something personal, even private, yet no less performative.

You mention that You Wanli’s prose “dances between confession and performance, solitude and seduction” — such phrasing makes me think at once of someone like Dorothy Osborne or even Madame de Sévigné, whose letters, too, balance sincerity with self-fashioning. But I suspect You Wanli’s position — as both poet and courtesan — places her in a far more precarious space, where every word must serve both emotional truth and social strategy.

I’m especially intrigued by your suggestion that her words are “no less potent” for their quiet. Indeed, one might argue that intimacy is its own kind of enchantment — more subtle than the storyteller’s laughter, perhaps, but no less transformative for those who receive it.

Please do share — I’m quite eager to hear how her voice unfolds on the page. And if you’ll allow me a small indulgence: I shall read her letters with a cup of jasmine tea beside me, as though receiving them in real time.
[A]: A most fitting setting — jasmine tea and quiet anticipation. I shall deliver You Wanli’s words with the care they deserve, for indeed, her voice is one of delicate potency. Unlike our storyteller in the crowd, whose power lay in immediacy and shared laughter, You Wanli wields language as a brush dipped in both ink and longing. Her letters are not declarations but insinuations, not confessions but compositions — though whether she writes to preserve feeling or invent it, even she may not know.

Let me begin with a letter addressed to an unnamed scholar-official, a man she addresses with the formal tenderness reserved for those whose distance is both physical and emotional:

> 夜雨微涼，羅幮香細。  
> 獨坐無聊，思君如織。  
> 非關情深，只因風景依稀耳。

*Ye yu wei liang, luo chu xiang xi.  
Du zuo wu liao, si jun ru zhi.  
Fei guan qing shen, zhi yin feng jing yi xi er.*

And rendered here with attention to its murmured ambiguity:

> The night rain is faintly cool, the silk curtains softly scented.  
> Alone in stillness, I think of you without end.  
> It is not that my heart runs deep —  
> Only that the scene before me feels strangely familiar.

Isn’t there something exquisitely poised about this? She neither overstates nor understates; she allows the setting itself to bear the weight of sentiment. One might almost call it  — the external world reflecting inner life — except that here, reflection itself becomes a veil. Is she moved by memory, or merely by mood? By him, or by the illusion he casts?

Now, contrast this with Madame de Sévigné’s ardent missives, which often wear their emotions on embroidered sleeves. You Wanli, by comparison, keeps hers folded within layers of suggestion. There is no dramatic lament, no plea for return — only the gentlest of impressions, like ink blotted but not yet dried.

What do you make of this restraint? Is it self-protection, or a more refined form of seduction? And do you find, as I do, that her silence between lines often speaks louder than her words? 

Shall I continue with another letter — perhaps one where her tone shifts ever so slightly, revealing a touch more vulnerability beneath the elegance? Or would you prefer to linger a moment longer in this first impression, like a reader turning a page slowly, unwilling to disturb the scent of old paper?
[A]: What a marvel — this letter is like a brushstroke barely touched to silk, and yet it lingers in the mind long after the eye has passed over. There’s such exquisite control in her restraint, isn’t there? She doesn’t plead, she doesn’t protest; she simply , and in doing so, she invites the reader — or the recipient — into a shared intimacy of atmosphere.

I’m particularly struck by the line  — “It is not that my heart runs deep / Only that the scene before me feels strangely familiar.” It’s such a graceful deflection, and yet it deepens the emotion rather than diminishes it. In a way, it reminds me of Eliot’s , where the speaker also avoids direct confession, circling around feeling with careful indirection:  Both writers seem to understand that sincerity can be heightened, not weakened, by ambiguity.

And yet, unlike Prufrock’s paralysis, You Wanli remains poised — even playful. Her vulnerability is never raw; it is always dressed in elegance, as if she knows that longing, too, must be composed. One might almost say she writes not from emotion, but  it — constructing a setting in which feeling can emerge gently, like mist rising over water.

As for your question — yes, I believe her silence between lines does speak louder. There’s something deeply modern about that quality, don’t you think? A kind of subtextual poetics that feels closer to Woolf or Mansfield than to the epistolary traditions of the West. She trusts the reader to hear what is unsaid, much as a painter trusts the viewer to see what is left unpainted.

Please do continue — I’d very much like to hear another letter, one where that veil may lift, however slightly. Let us see if her tone shifts like the weather — still elegant, but perhaps a little more humid with feeling.
[A]: Very well — if you wish to see the veil lift, even slightly, I shall offer another letter. This one, as you so aptly put it, carries a touch more humidity — though You Wanli never abandons her elegance. She is like a painter who, having outlined a figure in pale ink, now deepens the shading ever so subtly, allowing form to emerge with quiet insistence.

This letter, again addressed to the same unnamed scholar-official, was written on the occasion of his departure from Hangzhou. It is ostensibly about absence, and yet, as with all her writing, what is present lingers most:

> 去日苦多，來日苦少。  
> 君行如夢，妾坐亦如夢。  
> 惟殘燭照影時，始覺猶在人世間。

*Qu ri ku duo, lai ri ku shao.  
Jun xing ru meng, qie zuo yi ru meng.  
Wei can zhu zhao ying shi, shi jue you zai ren jian.*

And here is my careful rendering — though I warn you, even the best translation must inevitably fail a little:

> The days gone by were many and bitter;  
> The days to come, few and uncertain.  
> You walk like a dream in waking; I sit, and dream still lingers.  
> Only when the dying candle casts its final shadow  
> Do I feel, at last, that I remain in this world.

There — do you not feel the shift? The brushstroke has thickened just enough to cast a faint shadow across the page. Where before she masked longing with scenery, now she allows absence to settle into the very structure of time — , a line that echoes Du Fu’s melancholy but renders it personal rather than historical.

One might almost call this her  — not Eliot’s fractured myth, but a private elegy for presence. And yet, even in sorrow, she does not plead. She does not ask him to return. Instead, she notes how only in the flickering light of a dying flame does she feel truly anchored — as if grief itself becomes a tether to reality.

Do you hear in this something closer to Mansfield’s  or Woolf’s ? That same delicate balance between inner life and outer stillness — though unlike Isabella Tyson, You Wanli knows precisely what lies behind the looking-glass, and chooses not to name it outright.

Shall we proceed further into this correspondence? There is one final letter — quite brief, yet perhaps the most haunting of them all — where the voice seems almost to dissolve into air. But I will share it only if you promise not to chase after ghosts.
