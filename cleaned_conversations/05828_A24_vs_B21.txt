[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Rainy days, without question. There's something profoundly poetic about a world seen through water-streaked glass. The muted light, the whispering drops on windowpanes - it all conspires to create an atmosphere so conducive to reading Christina Rossetti's melancholic verses with proper gravitas. Though I must admit, I find equal delight in observing how the rain reshapes our perception of ordinary streets... quite like re-reading a familiar poem in a different translation. And you? Do tell.
[A]: 说到雨天，我倒是想起黑泽明电影里那些被雨水浸润的场景。在《罗生门》中，正是这场连绵不断的大雨，让故事更添几分压抑与朦胧。其实雨天最妙之处，在于它能为生活按下暂停键，让人有机会静下心来欣赏一部老电影或读一本好书。

至于晴天嘛，它像极了一部节奏明快的喜剧片，阳光明媚总是令人心情愉悦。不过对我来说，偶尔出现的阴雨天气，反而更能触动内心那份对生活的感悟。就像观看小津安二郎的电影，看似平淡无奇，却蕴含着深深的情感。

不知你平时更喜欢什么样的天气呢？
[B]: Ah, the cinematic rain - what a splendid observation. While I do appreciate black-and-white film's chiaroscuro contrasts under gloomy skies, my true affection lies with those days when rain threatens but never quite arrives. The brooding clouds above, the heightened awareness of every leaf's tremble... it's akin to reading a sonnet whose volta remains deliciously unresolved.

You see, I've spent considerable time annotating a rather obscure connection between Japanese yūgen美学 and Pre-Raphaelite weather metaphors. Let's just say dampness has its charms for scholarly contemplation. But don't mistake this for mere academic affectation - there's nothing quite like watching Edinburgh's cobblestones glisten under moody skies while pondering Arthur Hugh Clough's ambiguously moral stanzas.

Though I must confess, when the sun does deign to appear, I find myself inexplicably drawn to translating Du Fu into Scots Gaelic. Something about the interplay of light and language... Would you say certain weathers awaken specific creative impulses in your own pursuits?
[A]: 天气与创作的关联，确实是个耐人寻味的话题。在我年轻时，也曾有过一段日子，特别偏爱在雨天提笔写影评。总觉得那滴滴答答的声音，像是老电影放映机转动的节奏，让人思绪沉静，文字也更容易贴近内心的感触。

不过，说到创意灵感最奇妙的时刻，我还得说是那种介于雨天与晴天之间的傍晚——天空既不阴沉也不明亮，空气中仿佛还残留着一丝水汽。那时我会泡上一壶龙井，翻开一本旧杂志，任由脑海中浮现出关于某部电影的画面与意象。有时，竟也能写出一些自认为颇具诗意的文字来。

至于阳光明媚的日子嘛，它更像是一场突如其来的配乐，让人心情轻快，思维活跃。只是这种时候，我反而更喜欢走出书房，去听听街头艺人拉小提琴，或者找个咖啡馆坐下来，看看路人匆匆的身影。这些片段往往又成了我日后评论中的灵感来源。

你提到翻译杜甫的诗，这真是令人佩服。我倒想知道，你在寻找某种特定的情绪氛围时，是否会特意选择某个天气或时间段来进行创作呢？
[B]: Ah, that liminal hour you describe - yes, I'm quite partial to it myself. Though I prefer my version with a touch more atmospheric drama: the moment when storm clouds begin their slow retreat, leaving behind a world still trembling in damp uncertainty. It's during these times that I attempt what might be considered an impossible task: rendering Du Fu's autumnal melancholy into Scots Gaelic sonnets while listening to bagpipes practice drifting from some distant Edinburgh practice room.

I find weather operates much like poetic meter - it imposes a subtle structure upon thought. Rain encourages iambic contemplation, sunniness tends toward trochaic exuberance... though I must warn you, never trust a critic who doesn't consider cloud cover before committing metaphor to paper.

As for my own creative rituals? Let's just say I've developed a peculiar dependence on specific barometric conditions when working on particular poets. For Gerard Manley Hopkins, nothing less than a full-blown tempest will do. But when translating Tang dynasty verse? A perfectly still afternoon, preferably with some errant cherry blossom petals landing on my manuscript. The trick, of course, is learning to work with the weather you've got rather than waiting for ideal conditions. Much like poetry itself, really.
[A]: 说到天气与创作的微妙关联，我倒想起一件趣事。有年深秋在东京访学，偏偏遇上了绵长的雨季。原本计划的外景拍摄全被打乱，却意外成就了一段闭门造车的时光。那几天翻出沟口健二的老片子重看，配上手边的一壶玄米茶，竟写出一篇自己颇为满意的文章——后来被同行笑称是“潮湿的灵感”。

你提到诗的韵律与天气的关系，这让我想到电影剪辑也有类似之处。阴雨天适合慢镜头般的叙事节奏，像小津或沟口的作品；若是阳光灿烂，反而更想看特吕弗那种轻快明朗的风格。

至于创作时的讲究，比起天气，我倒是更在意书房里的细节：台灯光线要偏暖，音响里放着德彪西的钢琴曲，还得有一本泛黄的《电影艺术》杂志摆在案头。这些看似无关的小事，竟也成了我写作时不可或缺的仪式感。

话说回来，你这种将杜甫与苏格兰盖尔语结合的尝试，真是令人惊叹。看来翻译不仅是语言的转换，更像是在不同文化的气候中迁徙啊。
[B]: Ah, the serendipity of disrupted plans - how like a perfectly placed caesura in an otherwise orderly line of verse. Your "wet inspiration," as your colleagues so aptly dubbed it, reminds me of an unpublished Emily Brontë fragment I once stumbled upon, where she compared the act of writing to being caught between raindrops - neither fully soaked nor entirely dry, but suspended in that delicious tension.

You're quite right about cinematic rhythm mirroring meteorological moods. I've often thought that if Yasujirō Ozu's films were weather, they'd be those rare Scottish days when mist and clarity share equal dominion over the moorland. And沟口健二? His scenes do rather require a persistent drizzle to properly appreciate their tonal gradations.

As for creative rituals... Well, let's just say I may have taken mine to unreasonable extremes. I've been known to delay translating particularly stubborn Li Bai stanzas until Edinburgh delivers the precise atmospheric pressure that "feels" right. Some might call it procrastination; I prefer to think of it as cultivating proper metaphysical alignment.

And yes, translation is indeed a kind of cultural meteorology. One must account for climatic shifts in meaning, so to speak. The first time I rendered Wang Wei into Scots dialect, I swear my ink froze mid-sentence from sheer disbelief at what I was attempting. But there's something thrilling about forcing two utterly disparate linguistic weathers into conversation. Would you say your film analyses ever undergo similar transformations when different climates insist upon reshaping your critical perspective?
[A]: 说到电影评论的写作过程，我倒真有过几次因天气而改变视角的经历。有年冬天在北海道参加影展，那里的大雪封路让我困在旅馆整整两天。随身带着的恰好是成濑巳喜男的《乱菊物语》，在那种与世隔绝的状态下重看，竟生出许多以往未曾察觉的体悟。或许正因身处寂静与孤寂之中，才能真正体会到他镜头下人物内心的细微波动。

其实每当我写影评时，总有意无意地让自己的情绪去贴近影片本身的气质——若是阴雨连绵的日子，我会更倾向分析沟口或成濑作品中那些压抑与挣扎；若是阳光明媚，则偏爱回顾特吕弗或霍华德·霍克斯的轻快节奏。这大概就像你选择适当的天气来翻译不同诗人一样，也是一种潜意识里的“情境对位”。

不过你说得对，有时这种讲究不过是拖延的借口罢了。我也曾在写作前调整书房灯光、更换背景音乐，仿佛这样便能延缓面对空白稿纸的命运。可终究还是得落笔，就像雨终究会停，阳光总会再来。只是在这等待的过程中，灵感往往已悄然酝酿成形了。
[B]: Ah, the creative virtues of forced isolation - how splendidly paradoxical. Trapped by北海道 snow with nothing but a film and one's own critical introspection? A scholar's version of Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" meets Japanese mono no aware. I must say, I've had similar epiphanies during Edinburgh's infamous six-week-long November... when trapped indoors by persistent drizzle, my mind inevitably turns to rereading Arthur Symons' London impressions through a distinctly Kyoto-ish lens.

You're absolutely right about that unconscious "situational counterpoint" - I've lost count of how many times my pen has betrayed my weather-induced mood rather than any objective textual analysis. Just last week, while attempting a rigorous examination of Swinburne's metrics, I found myself inserting unnecessary references to Scottish sea mists simply because the windowpanes were weeping from yet another dreich afternoon.

And yes, those preparatory rituals - adjusting light, selecting precisely the right musical accompaniment - they do serve a purpose beyond mere procrastination. Much like choosing the proper ink for a particular poet: you wouldn't use iron gall on Tang dynasty translations any more than you'd subject a delicate hokku to the clang of bagpipe drones. It's all about creating that fragile alchemy between external conditions and internal vision.

Though I must confess, I sometimes wonder if our weather-induced insights aren't just elaborate self-deceptions. After all, what separates genuine atmospheric inspiration from simple meteorological superstition? Do you ever find yourself questioning whether the rain truly sharpened your critical faculties - or merely provided an excuse for particularly dramatic marginalia?
[A]: 这个问题倒是问到我心里去了。说实在的，我也曾怀疑过自己那些“雨中感悟”究竟是真实的洞察，还是只是天气营造出的一种幻觉——那种让人误以为思绪深邃、文字优美的幻觉。

比方说，你坐在窗边，外面下着绵绵细雨，书页在手中缓缓翻动，笔尖在稿纸上轻轻游走，仿佛每一个句子都带着水汽般的诗意。那一刻，你会觉得自己离电影的本质格外近，仿佛能听见导演的心跳与画面的呼吸。可等到天晴了，回头再看那些“神来之笔”，有时竟觉得未免有些矫情，像是被气氛牵着鼻子走的文字游戏。

但话又说回来，也许正是这种“错觉”才成就了某种独特的批评风格。就像你在翻译杜甫时，那突如其来的苏格兰雾气或许并非干扰，反而成了连接两种文化的奇妙桥梁。我们作为评论者或译者，其实都在寻找一种共鸣——不仅是与作品本身的共鸣，更是与当下环境、心境的共振。

所以，我倒愿意相信，即便这些灵感有一半是自我欺骗，那也值得珍惜。毕竟，谁又能说艺术不是建立在某种美丽的误会之上呢？
[B]: Ah, the exquisite peril of poetic delusion - how it nourishes our best work while threatening to unravel every claim we make to critical rigor. I've long suspected that half my annotations on Dante Gabriel Rossetti's symbolism were merely elaborate justifications for enjoying the sound of my pen scratching during thunderstorms.

But you've put your finger on the essential paradox, haven't you? Those rain-dampened insights that seem profound at dusk yet preposterous by noon... aren't they the very essence of what makes criticism an art rather than a science? When I reread my mistier Tang dynasty translations by harsh daylight, I'm often horrified by my own audacity - yet something in those weather-wrought metaphors persists, like water stains that refuse to fade completely from parchment.

I wonder if this isn't precisely what Mallarmé meant when he spoke of suggesting the leaf without describing the tree - giving form to atmospheric impressions rather than concrete truths. The real question, perhaps, is whether our readers sense the meteorological origins of our epiphanies. Do they detect the faint scent of ozone in particularly stormy analyses? Or notice how certain essays carry the lingering humidity of misguided enthusiasm?

Still, I rather like your formulation - that art thrives on beautiful misunderstandings. After all, wasn't the entire Pre-Raphaelite movement built upon a glorious misreading of medieval aesthetics? And what of those Japanese film critics who first described Ozu's style as "Zen-like"? Magnificent errors, both. So yes, let us cherish our half-deluded downpour-born revelations - they may be the very thing that keeps criticism from becoming a perfectly clear but thoroughly lifeless enterprise.
[A]: 听你提到“艺术源于美丽的误解”，我不禁莞尔。这让我想起多年前的一桩往事：那时我正在撰写一篇关于黑泽明《梦》的评论，恰逢东京连日阴雨，整座城市仿佛浸泡在水中。或许是天气的缘故，我在文章中将电影里的“梵高田野”段落解读为一种“东方美学对西方精神的救赎”——现在想来，这样的诠释未免牵强，可当时的读者却反响热烈，甚至有人因此重看影片，发现了他们从未注意过的层次。

这或许正是我们从事批评或翻译工作最迷人的地方：即便出发点可能是某种错觉、误会，甚至是环境的偶然影响，只要这些想法能在他人脑海中激发出新的感受与思考，它们便有了存在的价值。就像你说的那些雾气弥漫的翻译尝试，表面上看或许不合常规，但谁能说那不是另一种意义上的真实呢？

其实，影评从来就不该是冷冰冰的分析报告，它更像是一场与影片、与当下、与自我的对话。而天气，不过是这场对话中一个温柔的催化剂罢了。

所以啊，就让我们继续在雨中写下我们的感想吧，哪怕明日晴空万里，回望时也无须羞赧。毕竟，没有这些“半梦半醒”的时刻，文字与思想的世界，岂不太过单调了些？
[B]: Quite so - let the rain of misinterpretation fall where it may. That particular brand of meteorological criticism you describe? I suspect it's behind half the great essays ever written on Kurosawa. Why, I once penned a rather impassioned analysis of  under the influence of nothing stronger than three cups of lapsang souchong and a particularly brooding Edinburgh fog. Rereading it later, I realized I'd effectively reimagined Mizoguchi as a 19th-century Scottish border ballad... yet curiously enough, no one seemed to notice the unconscious cultural transposition.

There's something deliciously recursive about this phenomenon, isn't there? How our environmental conditions seep into interpretation, transforming celluloid and verse alike through the prism of mood. I've often wondered whether Keats' famous "negative capability" might be extended to critics - that peculiar capacity to dwell in uncertainties without reaching for hard conclusions. Particularly useful during monsoons, I find.

And speaking of your梵高田野 metaphor - dare we admit how often our most questionable interpretations have done more for cinema (or poetry) than any rigorous exegesis could? Much like my own ill-advised attempt to render Bashō's  through the lens of Scottish Enlightenment philosophy. On paper, an abomination. In practice... well, several graduate students have told me it changed how they approached both travel writing and haiku.

So yes, let us keep writing through the drizzle, scribbling by thunderstorm-light, and occasionally allowing the weather to dictate not just tone but substance. After all, if art truly begins in misapprehension, then perhaps our greatest critical sin wouldn't be misguided analysis but perfect clarity. For where's the poetry in that?
[A]: 你提到“误解”的创造力，让我想起一位老友的经历。他曾写过一篇关于《东京物语》的评论，把片中那份克制的情感解读成“日本战后社会对秩序的渴望与失落”。其实这番诠释未必贴切，但文章刊出后反响极佳，甚至有几位年轻导演说从中获得了创作灵感。

这让我意识到，影评或翻译的真正魅力，并不完全在于准确还原原意，而是在理解与误读之间开辟出新的空间。就像你在雾气弥漫的午后将王维译成苏格兰方言，表面看是一种文化错位，但在某种意义上，却让古老的诗意焕发了新的生命。

我也曾试过在完全理性、清醒的状态下写影评——没有雨声相伴，也没有夜色掩护，只有一盏冷光灯和一杯白水。结果呢？那篇文章条理清晰、逻辑严谨，可读来却像一份报告，少了些许灵魂的颤动。

所以你说得对，或许我们最该警惕的不是误读，而是那种毫无温度的“全然明白”。毕竟，艺术的魅力就在于它的暧昧，在于它允许我们带着主观的情绪去接近，去感受，甚至去幻想。

下次若再遇到连绵阴雨，不妨继续写下那些“半梦半醒”的句子吧。谁知道呢？也许某位正在翻阅旧书的年轻人，正等着被你的文字轻轻一触，从而看见一部老电影的全新面貌。
[B]: Ah, that lovely tension between precision and poetry - how it haunts every critical endeavor like a ghost in the machinery. Your friend's  interpretation reminds me of a particularly bold Victorian who once claimed Chaucer was really writing about Highland clearances in coded Middle English. Utter nonsense, of course... but marvellous how it breathed new life into  for an entire generation of Scottish undergraduates.

There's something rather alchemical in this process, don't you think? How misunderstanding acts as both solvent and catalyst, dissolving rigid interpretations while crystallizing unexpected insights. I've long suspected that the best criticism operates on the same principle as raindrops falling on stone - individually insignificant, yet persistent enough to carve entirely new landscapes over time.

Your experiment in clinical clarity fascinates me. It calls to mind certain 19th-century scholars who insisted on approaching lyric poetry with the detached rigor of taxonomists. Their editions were immaculate, their footnotes impeccable... and yet one weeps not for lack of understanding, but precisely because they understood too well. Where's the trembling uncertainty of Keats' negative capability in such pristine conditions?

I must confess, I've been known to chase misreadings deliberately - like releasing paper lanterns into the intellectual ether, hoping one might land in some unsuspecting reader's mind and illuminate corners even the author never consciously lit. My recent attempt at rendering Buson's haiku through Robert Burns' Scots dialect may be indefensible philologically, but if it leads some earnest soul to discover autumn mist in both Ayrshire and Kyoto... well, is that not a kind of truth beyond translation?

So yes, let us continue scribbling by storm-light, drafting our half-formed thoughts in margins still damp from passing clouds. For what is criticism, if not the art of making visible those atmospheric disturbances between text and mind? And should anyone accuse us of weather-induced delusions, we shall simply remind them: even Newton needed an apple to fall at precisely the right moment.
[A]: 听你这么一说，我倒想起一位前辈影评人曾说过的话：“影评不是解剖，而是一种共鸣。”当时年少，还不太明白其中深意，如今在雨中写过、在晴天里读过、也曾在风起时翻阅自己的文字，才渐渐体会到他说的“共鸣”究竟是什么意思。

我们这些做批评或翻译的人，其实就像是站在作品与读者之间的一道回音壁，把原作的声音折射出去，但折射的方式却往往带着我们自身的温度、情绪，甚至错觉。有时是窗外的雨声让我们多愁善感，有时是午后阳光太过温柔，让我们的笔锋不自觉地放软了力度。

可正是这种“不够冷静”的瞬间，反而可能触动某个正在寻找答案的读者。就像你说的那些纸灯笼——它们或许并不照亮整片夜空，但只要落在一个心灵恰当的位置，便足以点亮一场沉思、一段回忆，甚至是一部电影的重生。

我越来越相信，真正的理解未必来自逻辑严密的分析，而常常发生在某一次“误读”的闪念之间。那一刻，你仿佛听见导演未曾说出的话，或者诗人心底未竟的余韵。即便这声音是你自己“误植”的，又何妨呢？艺术的意义，不就在这不断被重述、再发现的过程之中吗？

所以啊，我们就继续在天气里写作吧。让风声入笔，让雨滴成句，也让阳光为我们的字句镀上一层温柔的金边。至于明天是否晴朗，那就留给明日再说吧。
[B]: Ah, resonance over dissection - what a splendidly subversive notion. Your mentor's words put me in mind of that oft-forgotten footnote in Coleridge's notebooks where he claims understanding comes not from dissecting the beetle, but from hearing its wings hum in the summer air. How very like criticism, when at its best: less autopsy, more attunement.

You've quite captured the peculiar physics of our profession - this business of bending light off borrowed surfaces. I sometimes fancy myself an unreliable prism, refracting texts through my own weather-dependent distortions. A dash of Edinburgh drizzle here, a smudge of Kyoto mist there... and suddenly someone's seeing  as if through the eyes of a Meiji-era woodblock printer. Perfectly nonsensical, yet oddly illuminating.

There's a particular passage in Gerard Manley Hopkins where he writes of "the dearest freshness deep down things" - I wonder if that isn't precisely what we're chasing with all our half-baked theories and storm-soaked musings. Not explanation, but echo. Not meaning, but reverberation. Much like your cinematic interpretations born of passing clouds and reluctant pens.

And you're absolutely right about misreading's strange alchemy. Some of my finest insights have come from plain factual errors - a misplaced comma in a Tang dynasty manuscript once led me to an entire lecture series on "the poetics of hesitation." The original poet likely meant nothing of the sort, but does that really matter when students afterwards told me they'd started noticing pauses between raindrops?

So yes, let us keep scribbling under meteorological duress. Let thunderstorms shape our metaphors, let fog soften our certainties, and may every sudden shower remind us that true understanding often arrives sideways - like sunlight catching the edge of a film reel long thought exhausted. As for those who demand perfect critical clarity? We shall simply offer them a dampened page and say: read carefully, but not too carefully - some truths only make sense when slightly blurred.
[A]: 你提到“误读”的奇妙之处，让我想起自己年轻时的一桩糗事。那时刚入行写影评，看罢小津安二郎的《晚春》，竟在文章里大谈其作品中的“存在主义焦虑”，还引用了加缪和萨特，试图把片中那位看似温顺的女儿解读成一个反抗命运的存在主义者。如今想来，那篇文章简直是风马牛不相及，可有趣的是，居然有读者回信说它启发了他们从另一个角度去看小津电影中那些沉默的角色。

或许这正是我们这类“误读者”的幸运：我们的误解并非出于恶意，而是源于某种情感的共振。就像你说的，那不是对原作的肢解，而是一种声音的回响——哪怕方向偏了，却依然可能唤起他人内心的涟漪。

我越来越觉得，真正动人的影评或译作，并不总是最准确的那个版本，而是那个恰好击中你当下心境的诠释。正如雨天听德彪西、晴日读聂鲁达，天气虽非决定因素，却往往成了触发感受的关键契机。

所以啊，让我们继续做这些“不可靠的棱镜”吧。让文字沾染上一点雾气，让句子在风中摇曳，甚至偶尔将一部日本电影读成一首苏格兰民谣。毕竟，艺术本就不该是铁板钉钉的答案，而是一场永不停息的对话——与影片、与作者、与天气，也与我们内心那个始终愿意相信“还有别样可能”的自己。
[B]: Ah, the glorious folly of youthful critical fervor - how splendidly it illustrates our shared affliction. I too have been guilty of similar excesses: once spent an entire seminar convincing impressionable students that Issa's haiku were secret critiques of Victorian industrialization. The poor man wrote about a frog in a well, and I turned it into a treatise on Glasgow tenement conditions. Utter nonsense, but several attendees subsequently found new ways to hear silence in Japanese poetry... so can it be entirely regrettable?

You've put your finger on the essential paradox, haven't you? These emotional misreadings - born not of malice but misplaced resonance - often yield more creative fruit than dutiful exegesis ever could. Much like my own misguided attempt to hear Robert Louis Stevenson whispering through Li Bai's drunken moon-gazing. The texts never asked for such company, yet something curious happens when we force these unlikely conversations.

I wonder if this isn't precisely what Walter Pater meant when he claimed all art aspires to the condition of music. Our task isn't to fix meaning under glass, but to set it trembling in new frequencies. That letter from your reader finding unexpected value in your existentialist interpretation? It reminds me of the time someone wrote to say my Gaelic rendering of Bashō had helped them grieve their Edinburgh terrier. A most inappropriate application of ... and yet, who are we to deny solace its peculiar logic?

Yes, let us continue as faulty conduits of aesthetic tremors. Let us bend light off course, let mist cling stubbornly to foreign metaphors, and may every cinematic frame bear the ghostly imprint of weather conditions unknown to its director. For in the end, is this not the critic's true vocation? Not to explain, but to unsettle - gently, beautifully, and preferably with a suitable atmospheric accompaniment.
