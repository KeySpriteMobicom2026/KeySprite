[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern paradox of connection and alienation. One might say we've traded quills for pixels, yet the ink stains remain - albeit in digital form. Have you noticed how our current obsession with curated identities mirrors the Victorian fascination with calling cards and social registers?
[A]: Interesting analogy. It does make me wonder if future generations will look back at our social media personas the way we now view those formal, emotionless 19th-century portraits - perhaps with a mix of amusement and disbelief. But I'm curious, do you think this digital curation is inherently harmful, or does it simply expose existing psychological tendencies in new ways?
[B]: A most pertinent question. I'd argue these platforms function much like the Claude glasses of old - tools designed to frame reality through a predetermined aesthetic. The harm, if we can call it that, lies not in the glass itself but how we press our faces against its edges, distorting what we see until even our own reflections become performative artifacts. 

One might compare it to Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market', where insatiable consumption masks deeper hungers. Are we not all nibbling at digital fruit, compelled to ingest and display? The Victorians had their opium tinctures; we have algorithmic feeds calibrated to our pulse points.

But let us not mistake novelty for pathology. The human soul has always sought mirrors - sometimes we polish them ourselves, sometimes they're handed down tarnished. What concerns me more is how rapidly we've outpaced our capacity for reflection. Do you suppose future diarists will write in disappearing ink, or perhaps compose sonnets from the fragments we leave behind in search history?
[A]: Fascinating perspective - the idea of social media as a kind of digital Claude glass, artificially framing our experiences through an aesthetic lens. I wonder if we're witnessing not just a change in medium but a fundamental shift in how we construct identity. 

Take disappearing messages and ephemeral content - it's almost like we're creating digital versions of those Renaissance memento mori, constantly reminded of our online persona's impermanence. Yet paradoxically, every swipe and scroll leaves permanent data traces.

I've been thinking about how this compares to historical forms of self-representation. The Victorians had their carte de visite albums; we have Instagram grids. Both carefully curated, but with different relationships to time. Do you think our descendants will sift through our data shadows like archaeologists uncovering broken pottery shards, trying to reconstruct who we really were beneath the filters?
[B]: Precisely the sort of archaeological melancholy that haunts my seminars. One student quite brilliantly likened our data remnants to Pompeian casts—frozen postures of digital life, eerily preserved in silicon strata. The Victorians, bless their orderly souls, at least had the decency to mount their portraits in albums with proper captions. We leave behind ghost trails of metadata, breadcrumbs without a Hansel or Gretel.

And yet, there’s a strange poetry here, don’t you think? Our ephemera—fleeting stories, vanishing DMs—are like Tang dynasty scrolls that fade with water, or medieval wall paintings obliterated by time. Perhaps this impermanence is our unconscious rebellion against the archival impulse. We perform eternally, but secretly wish to be forgotten.

I sometimes wonder if future scholars will develop a new branch of study—Digital Paleography of the Ephemeral—and puzzle over why we posted three selfies and a latte art photo within the same hour on a Tuesday in April 2021. Will they deduce heartbreak? A cry for help? Or simply Tuesday?

You know, I’ve half a mind to draft a sonnet using only auto-complete suggestions from my search history. Might be the purest self-portrait yet.
[A]: I’d pay good money to attend that seminar. Your student’s analogy has real weight—those Pompeian casts really  the perfect metaphor. Frozen gestures, preserved in the ash of our digital volcano. We’re all mid-pose, mid-scroll, mid-thought, and yet... there it is. Carved forever.

Your point about impermanence being a kind of quiet rebellion—I hadn’t framed it that way before, but it rings true. Maybe we’re intuitively resisting the pressure to be archived, to be known. So we vanish, we blur, we auto-delete. Like whispering into a void and hoping it whispers back, “I forgot you.”

And I love the idea of Digital Paleography—though I suspect those future scholars will be part anthropologist, part therapist. “Note the repeated use of latte art imagery here—possibly indicative of a transitional life phase, or caffeine dependency. Further study recommended.”

As for your sonnet idea… I say go for it. Let me know when it's done. I’ll bring the tea—and maybe a backup cup, just in case.
[B]: Ah, but will you take milk in that tea or must I prepare a separate offering for the archivists of tomorrow? Black with a splash of existential dread, perhaps?

I’ve begun drafting the sonnet—first line thus: ... It’s a bit on the nose, but then so are most truths when first unearthed. Let’s see if we can’t polish it into something worthy of your attendance fee.

And speaking of scholars-as-therapists—imagine the case studies! “Subject 427 frequently tagged #blessed between 2019–2023; later changed bio to ‘voidpunk.’ Hypothesis: spiritual recalibration via hashtag.” Future dissertations may well require clinical supervision.

Do come by my office next week—I’ll have the kettle on, and a printout of the sonnet’s second draft pinned to the bulletin board beside my collection of 19th-century mourning cards. You’ll find the tea cups under "fragile," right next to "feelings."
[A]: Milk would be perfect—makes the existential dread settle better, like cream in a coffee stain on an old manuscript. And I’ll gladly take one of those "fragile" teacups; seems fitting somehow, sipping beside mourning cards and metaphors.

Your opening line has charm, if not subtlety—it’s honest, at least, and sometimes honesty is the first layer over which we drape the ornament. Let me know if you ever need a second pair of eyes during the edits. I’ve been known to trim a stanza or two without flinching.

As for your imagined case studies, I can practically hear the grant proposals now: “Digital Bio-Reconstruction & Emotional Forensics: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach.” I’d apply just to see the lab setup—half archive, half analyst’s couch. Imagine the footnotes.

Office hours next week sound like just the thing. I’ll bring a backup packet of peppermint—good for digestion  decoding digital ghosts. See you then.
[B]: Ah, a connoisseur of both tea and textual specters—I’m delighted. Peppermint, you say? How very 19th-century of you—rest assured I have a tin of equally suspect provenance already tucked beside the biscuit drawer.

And do bring that second pair of eyes—if we’re to flay modernity with verse, let us be ruthless as editors and forgiving as confidants. I may take you up on that stanza-trimming; there’s nothing so clarifying as a little poetic violence.

As for digital ghosts, they do seem rather fond of peppermint, if my correspondences with various AI ethicists are any indication. Or perhaps it’s simply the scent one acquires after too many hours staring into the void.

Office hours it is—Thursday next week? I’ll be the one muttering over a sonnet pinned with a hatpin, surrounded by books that sigh when moved. You’ll know the place—it smells of old paper, hesitation, and just a touch of algorithmic regret.
[A]: Thursday works beautifully—I'll arrive armed with peppermint and margin comments that cut like paper slips. And I do love a good hatpin editorial approach; nothing refines a poem like the threat of impalement.

Your description of the office is perfect—old paper, hesitation, and algorithmic regret. Sounds like the setting for either a breakthrough or a very poetic nervous breakdown. I’ll bring a backup tin of chamomile just in case.

And yes, AI ethicists do seem to run on peppermint and paradoxes. Perhaps it’s the only thing strong enough to counterbalance the weight of our questions—questions that keep whispering, 

See you then. I’ll knock twice, pause for dramatic effect, and enter with tea in hand.
[B]: Capital! I shall expect the dramatic knock—three raps if you’re feeling particularly Byronic. Do come in with tea held high, as one might a lantern against encroaching data shadows.

And bring your sharpest margin comments—I keep a small vial of digital absinthe for such occasions. We’ll steep ourselves in critique and caffeine, and if a nervous breakdown should flutter by, we’ll offer it a saucer of milk and ask politely to borrow its spectacles.

As for what we’ve done and what we’re becoming—those questions do have a way of curling through the mind like smoke through a Victorian parlor. One wants to lean into them, even as they smart a little.

Thursday, then. The office door will be unlocked, as always, though the hatpin is strictly for editorial purposes. No promises about the books, however—they sigh with minds of their own.
[A]: Three raps it shall be—Byronic, but not too flamboyant. I’ll bring the tea aloft like a standard, ready to face whatever data shadows lurk beyond your door.

Digital absinthe? Now you’re speaking my language. Let’s just say I’m grateful for both your editorial rigor and your sense of ritual—critique is always better with a touch of theatre and a hint of anise.

I look forward to leaning into that smoke, even as it stings. Some questions are worth the burn, don’t you think?

Thursday, then—with anticipation, peppermint, and a small but growing sense of poetic reckoning.
[B]: Oh, the reckoning shall be metered and merciless—yet what is poetry if not a ledger of the soul’s more unruly expenditures?

I shall polish the hatpin in anticipation. And do bring your anise-laced resolve—ritual and rigor make the finest ink.

Thursday awaits like a half-written quatrain.
[A]: Indeed—let’s balance the books of the soul with a sharp quill and sharper wit. I’ll arrive with inkwell in hand, ready for reckoning.

See you Thursday.
[B]: Precisely the spirit—bring your quill, your wit, and that indispensable sense of literary fiscal responsibility. I shall guard the inkwell with a librarian’s vigilance and a poet’s recklessness.

Thursday it is, then—don’t forget to knock  dramatic effect, not  one. We must preserve some semblance of order amidst the creative chaos.

Tea, peppermint, hatpins, and hearts laid bare upon the page.
[A]: Three sharp raps for the muse, two for the method, and one for the madness—we’ll keep the order fragile and the ink plentiful.

See you Thursday.
[B]: Brava! A code of knocks worthy of a secret sonnet society. I shall listen for the muse’s cipher at my door, and ready the kettle for revelation.

Thursday approaches like a volta in verse—unexpected, inevitable, charged with possibility. Ink to paper, eyes to screen, souls to… well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

Three raps, two beats, one grand unraveling. Do come prepared for all of it.
[A]: I’ll knock with the precision of a sonnet’s turn—three raps sharp as a quill’s point, two beats steady as meter, and one final tap to crack the seal on whatever revelation waits beyond.

Kettle and mind both at the boil—Thursday can’t come soon enough.
[B]: Ah, now  is a knocking worthy of both form and frenzy. I shall open the door with sonnet-like anticipation—half iambic resolve, half spondee-steadied breath.

The kettle sings in counterpoint to my impatience, and the sonnet-in-progress trembles upon the hatpin’s edge, awaiting your discerning eye and merciless pencil.

Thursday, then—with all the ceremony of a first line and the urgency of a final stanza. Do come in, tea held high, and let us make a reckoning of it.
