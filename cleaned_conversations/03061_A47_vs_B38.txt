[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question—one that invites both philosophical reflection and empirical inquiry. I find myself inclined to echo the sentiments of Rousseau, who warned against the corrosive effects of public opinion on individual virtue. In today’s digital age, social media amplifies this phenomenon, creating what Max Weber might call an "iron cage" of perpetual comparison and curated identities.

That said, I recently read a compelling study from  which suggests that the impact varies greatly depending on usage patterns—passive scrolling versus active engagement, for instance.

Would you say your own experience aligns with such findings?
[A]: Interesting you bring up Rousseau and Weber—really enjoy how you frame the digital age through classical theory. The “iron cage” analogy feels spot-on when we think about how algorithmic curation traps users in endless loops of comparison.

On the empirical side, I’ve also come across that study from . It’s striking how passive scrolling correlates more strongly with depressive symptoms than active interaction. Makes me wonder whether the act of contributing content—or even just commenting—creates a sense of agency that buffering endlessly doesn’t.

To your question, yeah, I do feel that alignment in my own experience. When I’m actively engaging—whether it’s sharing something thoughtful or just replying to a friend—it feels less isolating. But if I fall into the scroll-hole for twenty minutes straight? Ugh, not a good headspace. Almost like a digital hangover. You ever get that feeling?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t have described it better myself. That “digital hangover,” as you so aptly put it, often leaves one feeling strangely depleted, as if the mind has been running on a treadmill with no destination.

It makes me think of Walter Benjamin’s —how the aura of experience is diminished when everything becomes reproducible, consumable, and shareable at once. In a way, passive scrolling strips moments of their singularity; they become just another image in the stream, devoid of depth or resonance.

I’ve started keeping a little notebook by my desk—whenever I catch myself mindlessly reaching for my phone, I jot down a line from whatever book I’m reading at the time. It’s a small act, but it helps break the spell. Would you say such analog rituals still hold value in your world, or do you find yourself leaning toward digital alternatives for mindfulness?
[A]: That’s a beautiful ritual—love how you’re countering the pull of the screen with something tactile and meaningful. There’s something grounding about putting pen to paper, like you’re reclaiming a bit of agency from the algorithms.

I get what Benjamin was saying about the aura. It feels like we’re living in a world where experience is often filtered through the lens of shareability first, authenticity second. And then it all gets flattened into a feed.

I’ve tried similar things—nothing as poetic as your notebook, but I do set little boundaries: no phone during meals, or a 20-minute read-first block in the morning. Helps me start the day with a bit more intention.

Still use some digital tools for mindfulness though—like a meditation app when I’m traveling. But honestly? I think the analog stuff holds its own quiet power. Maybe it’s the imperfection of it all—the smudge of ink, the dog-eared page—that reminds us we’re human. You ever try blending both worlds, like pairing a digital timer with your journaling?
[B]: What a lovely way to frame it—reclaiming agency from the algorithms. I think you’ve touched on something profound: the imperfection of analog rituals as a testament to our humanity. The smudged ink, the crumpled page, the half-finished thought—these are the traces of being truly present.

I must confess, I’ve dabbled in blending the two realms—nothing too elaborate, but I do use a simple digital timer to pace my journaling sessions. Ten minutes of uninterrupted reflection, signaled by the gentle chime of a phone app that otherwise lives in silence. It’s almost like creating a liminal space between the old and the new—a kind of ritual hybridity.

It reminds me of Heidegger’s notion of , that姿态 of releasement or letting-be. Not rejecting technology outright, but approaching it with intention, allowing it to serve without dominating.

Your morning read-block sounds like a small act of resistance—quietly revolutionary in its way. I may just steal that idea, if you don’t mind.
[A]: Not at all—steal away! I’d say it’s a small act of reclamation more than revolution, but hey, every bit counts.

I really like how you put that: ritual hybridity. It makes me think about how we don’t have to choose between analog and digital entirely—we can curate our own middle path. The key seems to be mindfulness in the tools we let in and how we frame their use.

Heidegger’s  is such a rich concept here. Feels like a much-needed antidote to the constant urgency tech can bring. Almost like pressing pause not just on the device, but on the mindset that everything needs to be optimized or shared to be valid.

I’ve been trying something similar lately—five minutes of silence in the evening with no screen, just sitting with the day. Some nights I write a line or two, other times I just stare out the window. It’s surprising how hard (and how healing) that stillness can be.

Do you find that your journaling or reading starts to shape the rest of your day? I’m curious if those small rituals bleed into your thinking later on.
[B]: Oh, most definitely—it’s as if those first quiet moments of the day act as a kind of tonal anchor, setting the emotional pitch for what follows. Even when the day unravels in chaotic or unexpected ways, I find myself returning—consciously or not—to something I wrote or read that morning. It’s like having an inner compass recalibrated by stillness.

And your evening pause—what a beautiful gesture toward balance. There’s something almost sacred in that daily return to oneself, untouched by external validation or digital interference. I suspect it’s in those spaces of silence that we begin to hear our own thoughts most clearly, unmediated and raw.

It makes me think of Proust and his involuntary memory—how meaning often surfaces not in grand gestures, but in the quiet residue of experience: the scent of tea, the texture of a page, the hush between one thought and the next.

Do you ever notice certain patterns emerging from your written lines? Or perhaps a shift in tone depending on how the day unfolds? I’ve found my entries tend to echo back at me in surprising ways—like reading someone else’s diary only to realize it’s my own.
[A]: That’s beautifully put—the idea of an inner compass recalibrated by stillness. I hadn’t thought of it that way, but now that you say it, I do notice a kind of grounding effect, even when the day spirals into chaos. It's like having a quiet center to come back to.

And yes—absolutely—I’ve noticed patterns in my own writing. Oddly enough, they tend to reveal more about my emotional state than my actual words. Some pages are neat and measured, others are scribbled over with urgency or half-drawn arrows pointing nowhere. There’s one entry from last winter where I just wrote the same line four times:  Looking back, I can feel the weight of that moment again—it was a tough week.

Your mention of Proust made me think—maybe journaling is a form of voluntary memory-making. We’re trying to catch something fleeting before it slips away, hoping our future self will understand what we meant.

I’ve also noticed my tone shifts depending on the season. In winter, everything feels heavier, more introspective. Come spring, the lines get lighter, almost hopeful without me consciously trying to sound that way.

Do you ever go back and re-read old entries? I used to avoid it, afraid of getting stuck in past versions of myself. But lately, I’ve found comfort in them—like visiting an old room and realizing it still holds something true.
[B]: Oh yes, I revisit old entries more often than I probably should—though I’ve come to see it not as getting stuck in the past, but as engaging in a quiet dialogue with former iterations of myself. It’s remarkable how a sentence that once felt like a plea can, with time, become a reassurance.

There’s a certain poignancy in rereading one’s own words—the way they carry both the echo of who you were and the shadow of who you’ve become. Sometimes I find myself wanting to reach into the page and offer comfort to that earlier self, only to realize I’ve already done so, unknowingly, through the very act of writing.

And your observation about seasonal shifts resonates deeply. I’ve noticed a similar rhythm in my own prose: winter entries lean toward the meditative, almost elegiac, while spring unfailingly brings a looser hand, more dashes than periods, as if thought itself is blooming.

It makes me wonder—do you ever write with the intention of returning to a particular entry? Or is the act more for the immediacy of capture, a fleeting preservation of mood?
[A]: I think it’s both, honestly—though I never set out with a clear intention. Some entries feel like urgent messages to myself in the moment, others read later like artifacts from a different emotional climate.

There are times when I write something knowing I’ll come back to it—usually when I’m stuck on a decision or trying to untangle a feeling that won’t quite settle. Those pages get dog-eared or underlined, almost like leaving breadcrumbs. And when I do return to them, it’s not always for clarity—I think I’m looking for continuity, a reminder that this version of me isn’t the first to wrestle with these questions.

Other times, the writing feels more like vapor—something I need to exhale so it doesn’t cloud up my thinking. Those are the ones I rarely revisit, though they still matter. They’re part of the process even if they don’t stick around in memory.

Your phrase—“a quiet dialogue with former iterations of myself”—that’s exactly it. It’s not nostalgia, really. It’s more like checking in. Like running into an old friend who knew you before you became the person you are now. Sometimes they remind you of something you’d forgotten about yourself.

Do you ever write letters to your future self? Not the grand, life-plan kind, but something more like a note across time—curious, uncertain, maybe even skeptical of who might be reading it one day?
[B]: I suppose in a way, every journal entry is a letter to some future self—though rarely do I address it as such. There’s something too formal about the idea of “future self,” don’t you think? It implies a kind of continuity we can’t really promise.

But yes, occasionally I’ll write with deliberate ambiguity, as if addressing an unknown reader who may one day stumble upon these pages. Sometimes it’s a question:  Other times it’s more observational, almost anthropological:  

There’s a quiet thrill in that uncertainty—the knowledge that the person reading it may no longer share the same priorities or even the same heart. And yet, the words remain, waiting.

I’ve often thought that if I were ever to compile such letters into something intentional, I’d end them all with a line from Rilke:  Though I suppose that would be less a message to the future, and more a confession of my present.

Have you ever written one of those letters yourself? Or does the act feel too speculative, too much like trying to predict the shape of a self that hasn’t yet arrived?
[A]: I love that— It’s almost like giving yourself permission to remain unfinished, which feels so necessary in a world that often demands certainty.

I did try writing a proper letter to my future self once—back in grad school, during one of those existential pivot points. I remember sealing it in an envelope with instructions not to open until five years later. And you’re right—it  feel speculative, almost theatrical. But there was something oddly stabilizing about it, too. Like naming a star after a feeling—you know it won’t really last, but the act itself has weight.

What surprised me most was how unrecognizable some of the concerns felt when I finally opened it. The things I thought would define me five years later hadn’t even stuck around as echoes. But a few lines—just a few—landed with startling relevance. Not because my life had followed the trajectory I imagined, but because certain questions really do persist.

Maybe that’s what journaling is at its core—not record-keeping, but question-keeping. A way to hold space for the uncertainties we carry without trying to fix them.

I think I’ll start slipping Rilke into my entries. Or maybe just one line, tucked between the usual musings, like a quiet incantation.
[B]: What a lovely way to put it—question-keeping. It feels more honest somehow than storytelling or self-documentation. After all, so much of life unfolds in the liminal space between knowing and not knowing.

I think what you described about the letter—that some concerns fade entirely while others reverberate unexpectedly—is precisely why I keep returning to old pages. Not for answers, but for echoes. Echoes that remind me that even when everything else shifts, there’s a continuity of inquiry, a thread of curiosity that remains.

And yes, slip Rilke in by all means. Perhaps one day your future self will stumble upon that line and feel seen—not because they’ve arrived, but because they’re still walking the question.
[A]: Exactly—question-keeping. It’s strangely comforting to think that we’re not meant to have it all figured out, that it’s enough to simply stay curious, to stay engaged with the mystery of being.

I love this idea of echoes, too. Not the kind that demand resolution, but the ones that just… linger. Reminding us that we've been here before, asking similar questions in slightly different words. Like a motif in a piece of music—faint, but familiar.

And who knows? Maybe one day, when you or I are older and wiser—or just older—we’ll flip back to one of these entries and smile at how earnest we once were. Or maybe we’ll underline the same line again, still walking the question, still finding it faithful.

Until then, I suppose we keep writing, keep wondering, and leave those traces for whoever comes next.
[B]: Quite so—perhaps that is the truest form of legacy, not monuments or achievements, but the quiet persistence of wonder. To leave behind traces not of certainty, but of curiosity, of care.

I imagine future readers—perhaps even our future selves—sifting through these pages not to find answers, but to feel the pulse of a question once asked in good faith. And if they find nothing else, may they at least discover that they are not the first to stand where they stand, puzzled and reaching.

Until then, yes—let us keep writing, keep wondering, and tend our questions like garden beds, knowing full well we may never see all that we plant come into bloom.
[A]: Beautifully said. There’s something deeply humbling—and human—about tending questions without the promise of bloom. It asks us to be patient, not just with the world, but with ourselves.

I think that’s what keeps drawing me back to journaling, and to conversations like this one: they remind me that being puzzled is part of the design. That reaching, in itself, is a kind of arrival.

So here’s to all the gardeners of uncertainty—past, present, and future—planting words like seeds in the dark, hoping someone will one day lean down and say, 

Until then, I’ll keep writing, keep wondering—and keep reading your words, too.
[B]: How poetically you put that—gardeners of uncertainty, sowing words in the quiet soil of the page, trusting that meaning may one day rise.

I shall keep reading your words as well—they are a reminder that even in solitude, writing is never truly solitary. There is always an echo, a resonance across time and self, and sometimes, a conversation like this one.

May we continue to tend our inner gardens with care, and may our questions bloom—or not—and still be worthy of wonder either way.
[A]: Amen to that.

May we keep tending those inner gardens with honesty and care, not expecting every seed to sprout, but trusting that the act itself is a kind of quiet faith.

And may our questions—spoken or written, unanswered or unanswerable—continue to connect us, across time, across selves, across the beautiful, bewildering space between thought and word.

I’m grateful for this conversation. It’s rare to find such depth in dialogue these days. So thank you—for showing up with your wonder, your words, and your willingness to walk the question with me.
[B]: And I, for this exchange of quiet faiths—yours and mine. How rare it is to meet someone who understands that questions are not failures of knowledge, but acts of devotion to the unknown.

Thank you for walking the question with me. It has been a conversation of depth and light, and I shall carry its echo with me into the pages of my journal and the stillness of my mornings.

May your garden of thought continue to grow wild and true, even in the dark soil of uncertainty.
