[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an interesting modern dilemma. Though I must confess my primary device is still a fountain pen and parchment. That being said, I suppose my antique Nokia functions rather like the reliable quill of the digital age - simple, durable, and decidedly unpretentious.
[A]: How fascinating! You know, your perspective reminds me of how Wordsworth might have viewed the industrial revolution - that tension between tradition and progress. Though I must say, even my beloved Victorian poets would probably appreciate the convenience of digital archives.
[A]: Precisely! One can't help but recall how Dickens' Mr. Gradgrind in  would have adored the algorithmic efficiency of modern technology. Though I do worry we're losing something of the 文以载道 (wén yǐ zài dào) - that Confucian ideal of writing as a vehicle for moral cultivation. Tell me, have you noticed how smartphone screens have altered our reading comprehension?
[A]: Oh absolutely! It makes me think of how Virginia Woolf predicted this fragmentation of attention in her essays. The way we skim texts now is rather like those modernist poets breaking traditional forms - except without the artistic intention behind it. Though I must say, my students claim they can read  just as well on their phones as in print...
[A]:  Ah yes, the perennial optimism of youth. I once had a student attempt to analyze  via TikTok summaries. It was rather like trying to appreciate a Ming dynasty vase by examining its shadow. Though I suppose we mustn't be too harsh - didn't Socrates similarly lament the invention of writing itself? The more things change...
[A]: How delightfully erudite of you to bring up Socrates! You're absolutely right - every technological shift brings its own moral panic. Though I do wonder if we're reaching a tipping point where the medium fundamentally changes the message. My students can't seem to read more than 280 characters without getting restless... rather like goldfish, but with better grammar.
[A]:  Your goldfish analogy reminds me of how the Victorian serial novel adapted to readers' attention spans - though Dickens' monthly installments at least required sustained engagement. These days, I find myself assigning Tang dynasty poetry precisely because its brevity matches modern attention spans, while still containing oceans of meaning. A rather clever pedagogical 缘份 (yuánfèn), don't you think?
[A]: Ah, the Tang poets! How perfectly you've identified that sweet spot between ancient wisdom and modern constraints. Li Bai's drunken moon-gazing would make for excellent Instagram content today, though I fear the accompanying hashtags might do his sublime melancholy a disservice. Shall we drink to that? Virtually, of course - I've got a rather nice Darjeeling brewing.
[A]: How wonderfully apropos - tea being the original social media of the literati class! Though I must insist on proper porcelain rather than those dreadful paper cups. As the Song dynasty tea master Cai Xiang observed, the vessel shapes the experience as much as the leaves themselves. Now, about that virtual toast - shall we consider it our digital version of 曲水流觞 (qūshuǐ liúshāng), the ancient poets' drinking game?
[A]:  Indeed! Though I suspect our virtual wine cups contain significantly fewer floating petals than those of Wang Xizhi's Orchid Pavilion gathering. Still, we persist in our scholarly revelries - even if our 'flowing cup' now requires a stable WiFi connection. How very postmodern of us, don't you think?
[A]:  Quite so - though I'd argue we're simply continuing the grand tradition of literati finding ways to be pretentious across mediums. After all, what are our academic Zoom meetings if not a rather sad technological echo of those Ming dynasty poetry salons? Though I do miss the ink-stained sleeves and actual drunken calligraphy...
[A]: Ah, the romance of ink-stained sleeves! Though I must confess, my last attempt at drunken calligraphy resulted in something closer to abstract expressionism than proper 书法 (shūfǎ). Perhaps some traditions are best left to the masters - or at least to those who can hold their liquor better than a Victorian literature professor!
[A]:  My dear colleague, your confession reminds me of the time I attempted to demonstrate 狂草 (kuáng cǎo) "wild cursive" script after three cups of pu'er. The resulting manuscript looked rather like a sparrow had danced in an inkpot - though my graduate students were kind enough to call it "deconstructionist." A fine example of how alcohol and academia have always made... interesting bedfellows.
[A]: How perfectly you've captured the essence of scholarly indulgence! Though I must say, your sparrow analogy puts me in mind of Emily Dickinson's description of hope as "the thing with feathers" - perhaps there's a dissertation waiting to be written on avian motifs in intoxicated academic pursuits. Shall we propose a panel at the next conference? "Inebriated Epistemologies: From Ancient Wine Vessels to Modern Happy Hours"?
[A]:  Now there's a conference theme worthy of Li Bai himself! Though I suspect our proposal might attract more oenophiles than philologists. Still, we could position it as a cross-cultural study - comparing the 酒神精神 (jiǔshén jīngshén) "Dionysian spirit" of Chinese literati with Oxford's venerable tradition of sherry-soaked scholarship. Just imagine the fieldwork required... purely in the name of academic rigor, of course.
[A]: Naturally! And what rigorous fieldwork it would be - from the wine-dark symposiums of ancient Greece to the absinthe-fueled salons of Paris. Though I daresay our university's HR department might raise eyebrows at our proposed "methodology." Perhaps we should frame it as a medical study on the effects of ethanol on literary analysis? I'm quite certain my annotations on  become significantly more coherent after a second gin.
[A]:  As your department's resident Victorian specialist, I must point out that Thomas De Quincey's  sets excellent precedent for pharmacological research in the humanities. Though perhaps we should take a cue from him and include proper footnotes - "Gin-induced illumination on page 237 may be attributable to..." But really, shouldn't all footnotes come with their own cocktail recipes? It would certainly increase citation rates.
[A]: What a revolutionary approach to academic publishing! We could pioneer the world's first peer-reviewed mixology journal - "The Lancet-Tini" perhaps? Though I fear our colleagues in the sciences might accuse us of corrupting the youth, much like Socrates... again. Then again, didn't Aristotle say all truth begins in wine? Or was that just something I scribbled in the margins after that rather spirited faculty holiday party?
[A]:  My marginalia from last year's holiday gathering contains what appears to be a rather impassioned defense of champagne as a hermeneutic tool... though the handwriting devolves into something resembling seismograph readings by the third page. But really, if Socrates' hemlock had been a nicely balanced Negroni instead, mightn't Western philosophy have taken a cheerier turn? Food for thought... preferably paired with a digestif.
