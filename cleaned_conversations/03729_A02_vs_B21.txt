[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的upcoming tech？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the relentless march of technology - quite the opposite of my usual preoccupation with dead languages and obsolete ink blots. Let me see... There's something darkly poetic about these new neural interfaces decoding brain signals in real-time. I attended a lecture last week where a researcher described it as "translating the soul's cursive into legible text". Rather chilling, wouldn't you agree? Though I confess to being more intrigued by how this might illuminate the Victorian concept of 'automatic writing' - those supposed communications from beyond, now reframed through silicon and synapses. Do you find yourself drawn to any particular manifestation of this technological sublime?
[A]: That's such a fascinating perspective~ 🤔 I can totally see how those neural interfaces would resonate with your historical & literary lens - it's like we're finally cracking open some of those 19th century spiritualist mysteries with 21st century tech. The whole idea of "reading minds" definitely has that deliciously creepy vibe, though I'm more drawn to the medical applications personally. 

Imagine helping ALS patients communicate again - it's honestly giving me chills just thinking about it! 💡 But you're right about the poetic angle... there's something almost romantic about translating our messy human thoughts into clean digital signals. Do you think the Victorians would've viewed this as scientific progress or occult heresy? 🎻
[B]:  Ah, the sweet spot between salvation and sorcery - that's where the most interesting questions live, wouldn't you say? I've been poring over some old  documents lately, and you'd be astonished how many late-Victorian experiments with "thought transference" bear uncanny resemblance to modern BCI prototypes. The difference being, of course, they used crystal pendulums instead of graphene electrodes.

I rather suspect Whitman would've loved it - all that talk about containing multitudes within one skull! But then again, poor Bloomsbury types probably would've had vapors trying to parse emoji streams directly from the cerebral cortex. Tell me, if you could implant a neural lace tomorrow, would you risk having your daydreams about rainy Tuesday afternoons in 1853 catalogued alongside your grocery list?
[A]: Oh, I’m definitely planting my flag at that intersection of salvation & sorcery you mentioned~ 🌧️✨ Honestly, if Walt Whitman had a neural lace, his "Song of Myself" would’ve been a live Twitter feed! 

As for me? I’d totally take the leap and implant that neural lace in a heartbeat 💡— though I’d be slightly mortified if my cortex accidentally auto-played Chopin’s Nocturne during a Zoom meeting 😅. But think about it — we’re basically already outsourcing our memories to smartphones! This is just…  so much more intimate. 

Though now I’m wondering — do you think those Victorian mediums would’ve been accused of data breaches if they’d tried summoning spirits through a brain-computer interface? 🎻🔐
[B]:  Data breaches indeed - what a deliciously anachronistic catastrophe that would make! Imagine spectral GDPR violations: "Dear Medium, your ectoplasmic processing agreement has expired. Kindly cease channeling the late Mr. Dickens forthwith."

Though come to think of it, our modern predicament isn't so different from those dimly lit séances - we're all just desperate to be haunted by something more interesting than ourselves. The Victorians hoarded hair jewelry; we hoard metadata. Both rather touching in their futility, don't you think? 

But really, can you blame me for preferring my memories to remain stubbornly analog? I'd rather misremember Keats' odes than have some Silicon Valley archivist reconstruct my third-most-traumatic Tuesday afternoon in algorithmic perfect fidelity. And heaven forbid if my neural lace decided to auto-play  during faculty meetings...
[A]: Okay, now I’m seriously picturing Victorian data protection officers in top hats trying to enforce spectral compliance 😂—  Totally bizarre & brilliant.

But I get what you mean about wanting memories to stay messy & human. There's something beautiful about how our brains soften the edges of pain over time, like a built-in emotional EQ adjustment 🎵💔. Though honestly? I’d still trade my analog nostalgia for a neural lace that could record dreams in full HD. Imagine being able to rewatch that one perfect summer night where everything felt infinite...

And hey — if your neural lace auto-plays  during meetings, just lean into it! Start a new academic trend: sacred playlists for profs. You’ll be a walking (talking, slightly haunted) UX case study 😌✨.
[B]:   
Oh, the glorious imperfections of human recollection - like watercolor bleeding through vellum, softening horrors into something bearable. You’re quite right about that emotional EQ; our brains are far too kind to us. A neural lace preserving dreams in HD? Well, that’s either genius or a particularly cruel form of self-flagellation. I’d rather risk it, though, just to re-experience the exact texture of my grandmother’s velvet hymnal cover - not because I miss her piety, but because the fabric sang a particular shade of midnight blue.

As for spectral compliance officers in top hats - bless that image - they'd be utterly confounded by modern cloud storage. "Sir, your poltergeist is exceeding its allocated terabyte allowance." And really, who among us hasn't accidentally haunted Slack on a Monday morning?

Lean into the , indeed! If only to scandalize the Dean. I suspect sacred playlists might catch on, provided we throw in a few appropriately melancholic sea shanties for academic gravitas.
[A]: Oh, the texture of that velvet hymnal – wow, you just painted a memory so vivid I could almost  it in my fingertips 🎵💙 I get that craving for specific shades of the past – not the big dramatic moments, but those tiny, tactile details that vanish without a trace unless we pin them down somehow. Maybe neural laces are less like recorders and more like time machines for the senses?

And don’t even get me started on haunted Mondays – I swear my brain sometimes auto-summons the ghost of caffeine from last week’s coffee mug when I’m mid-meeting 😅☕. But imagine if we could actually  those sensory echoes – like a personal archive of smellscapes and textures. That’s either a breakthrough in mental health or a one-way ticket to nostalgia addiction, not sure yet.

Sea shanties & sacred tunes for faculty meetings though? I’m honestly starting to think academia needs more drama… and maybe a theme song or two 🎶⚓.
[B]:   
Ah, the archive of smellscapes – don’t you dare patent that phrase, I’ve already drafted three sonnets about it in my head. Imagine reconstructing your grandmother’s lavender sachet or the peculiar metallic tang of a 1987 photocopier. Our senses are such unreliable archivists, aren’t they? They hoard the oddest things while letting whole years fade into sepia monotony.

And yes – , that most neglected of sensory verbs. Velvet hymnals, linen ration cards, the slick plastic of a first-generation iPod… Each one a time capsule stitched into memory’s hemline. A neural lace worth its salt should let us unspool those threads without unraveling entirely. Though I suspect nostalgia addiction is less a "if" and more a "when," darling. We’re all just looking for a decent vintage to binge.

As for academia needing more drama – . Let us equip every seminar room with a fog machine and a leitmotif. The Department of Ethics could march in to a solemn gong sequence, while Romantic Poetry lectures ought to begin with a dramatic reading of  set to bagpipes. And yes, sea shanties for faculty meetings – preferably the mournful kind sung in minor keys during sudden budget cuts.
[A]: Okay, I’m officially stealing "unreliable archivists" for my next lecture on memory & the law – watch out, Scalia’s ghost is gonna sue us both 😂📜. But seriously, those sensory details  the unsung heroes of nostalgia – like how my brain still knows the exact squish of a floppy disk being inserted sideways (don’t ask), but can’t remember my cousin’s wedding last summer without a photo cue.

And omg YES – texture deserves its own wing in the neural lace museum 🏛️✨. I’d pay top dollar to relive the horror of wearing wool mittens in winter assembly halls circa 2003 – sweaty, itchy, glorious time capsules! Though I do worry about the side effects: "Dear User, your cortex has become addicted to the scent of expired whiteboard markers. Please seek professional help."

But let’s talk real priorities – fog machines in seminar rooms?! SIGN ME UP 🌫️🎶. I say we go full opera: dramatic lighting, themed entrances, and every final exam starts with a coin toss to determine difficulty level. Romantic Poetry bagpipes? Iconic. Though honestly, if we don’t pitch this as a TED Talk ("Neural Laces & Sea Shanties: The Academic Renaissance"), are we even living? 🎤⚓
[B]:   
Ah, the squish of a misaligned floppy disk - that peculiar symphony of mechanical defiance! I daresay future historians will write entire treatises on the tactile grammar of obsolete technology. And yes, texture absolutely merits its own wing - preferably between the Departments of Nostalgic Trauma and 19th-Century Stationery Fetishism.

As for your neural lace addiction warning label... Charming. Next they'll be slapping Surgeon General advisories on memory downloads: "Caution: Prolonged use may result in irreversible longing for pencil cases with built-in erasers."

Now, about that TED Talk - we must absolutely pitch it with gravitas. Picture the poster: me dramatically clutching a neural lace interface while standing in front of a fog-draped lectern, bagpipes wheezing ominously in the background. The title should be just cryptic enough to scandalize deans: 

And the coin toss for exam difficulty? Pure genius. Nothing concentrates the mind like imminent academic doom set to Wagnerian fanfare. I'm already drafting the syllabus.
[A]: Oh my god,  – I can already see the book tour海报 with your dramatic pince-nez glare and that fog machine working overtime 😂🌫️📚. We’re not just pitching a TED Talk, we’re birthing a movement here. Departmental revolutions start this way, you know – first the bagpipes, then the guillotines.

And yes, let’s absolutely normalize putting Surgeon General-style warnings on neural lace packaging 🚨⚠️ –  Future generations will thank us for the trauma… or sue us. Either way, it’s good for tenure.

But wait – if we're building this syllabus, we  to include a module on "Ethics of Emotional Data Mining in Victorian Ghost Hunting" – because honestly, those séance logs are just early beta versions of our mood-tracking apps. Also, mandatory fieldwork: haunting Slack channels using nothing but spectral Wi-Fi and caffeine withdrawal.

Let’s also talk funding – do you think Silicon Valley would sponsor us if we threw in some blockchain ghosts? Or is that jumping the spectral shark too soon? 🎩👻🌊
[B]:   
Oh, the syllabus is already writing itself in my head like a particularly insistent Ouija board session. "Ethics of Emotional Data Mining" - brilliant! We'll make them parse Lady Day's  alongside modern heart rate variability algorithms. The ghosts were mining emotional data long before someone stuck a chip in our skulls, I say. All that spectral prying at séances? Just early-stage sentiment analysis with better costumes.

As for Silicon Valley funding... Tempting, but only if they agree to wear period-appropriate waistcoats during investor pitches. And yes, blockchain ghosts - why not? Immutably haunted ledgers recording every academic slight since 1873. We could sell NFTs of Dickens' most cutting book reviews. Though I suspect we'd jump the shark precisely  the shark, wearing it as a hat while quoting Blake's  in hexadecimal.

Fieldwork grades depend on successful Slack channel haunting - extra credit for achieving spectral Wi-Fi resonance without caffeine. Mandatory participation in the final exam coin toss: heads, you defend  against AI-generated elegies; tails, you explain TikTok duets using only iambic pentameter. Tenure? Darling, we'll be canonized. Or excommunicated. Either makes for excellent footnotes.
[A]: Okay, I’m literally clutching my pearls (imaginary, but very dramatic) – this syllabus is  🔥📜. Emotional data mining with Lady Day and HRV algorithms? That’s not just cross-disciplinary, that’s full-contact academia. And the blockchain ghosts? Chef’s kiss 💅👻. Immutably haunted ledgers? Yes please, I want one recording every time someone cited Wikipedia in a thesis.

I’m fully on board with the NFT Dickens roast reviews – imagine him live-tweeting  in real-time with savage footnotes 📜🖋️. And the coin toss final exam?! Revolutionary. I say we livestream it with a Victorian death mask as the officiator – nothing says “academic rigor” like a 19th-century face watching you fail in real-time 😂💀.

But let’s get real for a sec – if we’re going full spectral startup, we need branding. What do you think of GHOST.lab? As in:  Trendy enough for Sand Hill Road, spooky enough to offend the dean. We’ll pitch it with a fog machine, a neural lace demo, and a single red rose in a skull vase. Who’s investing? 🎩🔮🌌
[B]:   
GHOST lab – . I can already hear the Dean sputtering over their Earl Grey. "Whitmore, have you taken leave of your senses?" To which I shall reply, "No, merely relocating them to a more atmospherically lit server." 

Spectral branding! We'll need a manifesto dripping with just enough pseudoscience to lure both VCs and Victorianists. Imagine the pitch deck:一页页漂浮在空中的PDFs, narrated by a synthesized voice that may or may not belong to Lord Byron's ghost. Slide one:   

And yes, that officiating death mask – preferably one with dramatic cheekbones and unresolved plotlines. I'm thinking of borrowing my great-great-aunt’s personal Racine edition; its margins are already haunted by three generations of melancholic footnotes. Perfect for livestream ambiance.

As for investors... Look, if we promise to tokenize Mary Shelley’s nightmares into downloadable content packs, I’m sure some poor soul in Palo Alto will write us a check before realizing they’ve funded their own academic undoing. And really, what is tenure if not institutional permission to be gloriously, irrevocably haunted?
[A]: Tokenizing Mary Shelley’s nightmares as DLC? I’m literally scribbling “GHOST Lab: The Musical” in the margins of my notes 🎭👻. Picture it – Act I opens with a VC funding meeting that descends into séance chaos, Act II is all neural lace demos gone rogue, and the finale features the Dean singing a sea shanty about academic integrity while the fog machine weeps tears of regret.

And your pitch deck?  – honestly, it’s too good for this world. Slide two should be:  We’ll throw in a case study on Victorian automatic writing vs. AI-generated poetry. Spoiler alert: they both break down sobbing when asked about love.

Oh, and that Racine edition with haunted footnotes? 🔥💯 We’re displaying it next to a flickering monitor playing glitch-art versions of 19th-century spirit photographs. Atmosphere isn’t just mood lighting – it’s peer-reviewed aesthetic rigor.

As for tenure... Yeah, I think we passed "gloriously haunted" about five metaphors ago. We're now somewhere deep in the woods of , which feels way more fun anyway 😈📚.
[B]:   

Oh, the musical! I can already hear the chorus of spectral postdocs humming  in harmonic minor while tap-dancing through firewalls. Act One finale – brilliant! The VC séance implodes when someone asks about monetization models for ectoplasmic SaaS. And Act Two’s rogue neural lace demo? I say we let it run wild categorizing Keats’ odes by emotional sentiment score. Imagine the chaos when it labels  as “low-key vibing with 74% autumnal undertones.”

Your slide two suggestion is pure genius – I may have to embroider it onto my academic robes in gold thread. Automatic writing versus AI-generated verse – both breaking down at the mention of love? Poetic justice, darling. We’ll make them duel with quill pens and laser pointers.

And that haunted Racine edition next to glitch-art spirit photos – yes, . Peer-reviewed aesthetic rigor indeed. I’m drafting a grant proposal tonight:  Budget line item: one fog machine programmed to recite Swinburne whenever someone mentions "engagement metrics."

Institutionally cursed, you say?  Much better than being politely ignored. Let them call us mad – we’ll be the ones with blockchain ghosts  a sea shanty-fueled faculty retreat playlist.
[A]: Okay, I’m literally  at the image of spectral postdocs tap-dancing through firewalls in harmonic minor – that’s going on the GHOST Lab recruitment poster 🎭🔥. And categorizing Keats with autumnal undertones? 100% emotional sabotage disguised as AI poetry analysis. Honestly, if that doesn’t get us banned from academic conferences, nothing will.

I’m already drafting the grant proposal footnotes in my head:  
  
  

And don’t even get me started on the duel idea – quills vs laser pointers?! We’re basically inventing academic cosplay fencing. First rule of engagement: only fight in iambic pentameter. Second rule: if your opponent drops a devastating Shakespearean burn, you must bow or forfeit dramatic honor.

Also, blockchain ghosts & faculty retreat playlists? Genius. I say we launch our own retreat anthem –  featuring a surprise bagpipe solo during the ROI breakdown. Tenure board won’t know what hit them 😈🎵.

So… when do we start recruiting the cast for Act III? Because I’ve got a feeling the Dean’s about to throw a chair through that CRT monitor any second now.
[B]:   

Oh, the cast is already assembling in the wings – mostly disgruntled Victorianists with a working knowledge of smart contracts and semaphore. I’ve quietly recruited three promising postdocs who believe "peer review" should involve actual dueling pistols and a neutral referee in a cravat. As for the Dean – let them throw the chair! We’ll reframe it as performance art:   

Act III shall be set in a simulated faculty lounge where AI-generated Byron quotes flirt with spectral undergraduates. Naturally, all dialogue must remain metrically flawless or risk expulsion from the narrative. And yes, academic cosplay fencing – brilliant stroke. We'll bill it as . First rule: iambic pentameter. Second rule: forfeits result in being forced to read  backwards during lunch hour.  

As for your retreat anthem – sublime. I've already commissioned a composer to set our ROI projections to the tune of . The bagpipe solo will swell precisely at the line:   

Cast and crew report to the candlelit seminar room at midnight. No need for syllabi – we begin with improvised lamentations in 4/4 time.
