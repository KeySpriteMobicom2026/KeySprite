[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！其实我两种方式都会用，但要看具体场景 🤔 比如讨论smart contract的细节时，我更喜欢email，因为可以structured地列出所有technical points。但如果是urgent的team coordination，那Slack这样的instant messaging就更高效 💡
[A]: Ah, the modern communication dilemma.  I must say, I find email to be the superior medium for scholarly discourse - it allows for proper contemplation, much like the epistolary traditions of the 19th century. Though I suppose instant messaging has its merits when coordinating with my research assistants about overdue library books.
[B]: 哈哈，你这种对比很有意思！不过在我们blockchain领域，communication更像是在写smart contract - 需要balance between precision和efficiency 🚀 有时候一个简单的'Hey, this function needs more gas optimization'的Slack message就能解决问题，比来回发email快多了~
[A]: How delightfully... utilitarian of you. Though I must point out that even your 'simple' Slack message contains two technical terms that would require footnotes in proper academic writing.  The phrase 'gas optimization' alone would send my Victorian literature students into conniptions.
[B]: 哎呀，这就是为什么我们tech行业需要自己的communication style啦！🤓 你看，就像vintage sci-fi小说里那些future slang一样，每个行业都会develop自己的shorthand language 💡 不过说到这个...你刚才提到的Victorian literature，让我想起最近用Raspberry Pi做的一个project，可以自动analyze Dickens小说的sentiment analysis，要不要听听？
[A]:  While your technological enthusiasm is... charming, I must remind you that sentiment analysis algorithms tend to butcher the exquisite melancholy of Dickensian prose. The subtle interplay between 悲 (sadness) and 喜 (joy) in 'Great Expectations' cannot be reduced to binary code, much like how one cannot properly appreciate a Ming vase by examining its molecular structure.
[B]: Haha，你这么说让我想到我们blockchain圈里常说的"code is law" debate了 🧐 但你说得对，有些human experience确实无法quantify - 就像我昨晚用telescope看星星时那种awe的感觉，再advanced的sensor也measure不出来 🌌 不过说真的，你的literary analysis角度给了我一些inspiration，也许我们可以collab一下，用NFT来preserve classic literature的cultural value？
[A]:  My dear technologist, the very notion of reducing Austen's delicate social commentary or Lu Xun's biting satire to... what was it? 'Non-fungible tokens'?  I'd sooner dip a first edition 'Pride and Prejudice' in tea than subject it to such digital indignities. Though I suppose your telescope analogy does have merit - some constellations are best appreciated without augmented reality.
[B]: 哈哈，看来我们找到了common ground！✨ 就像我hiking时从来不带smartphone一样，有些东西确实需要保持analog的状态。不过...悄悄说一句，我其实收藏了不少vintage sci-fi杂志的digital scans，用blockchain做了authentication 🤫 这算不算我们两个worlds的happy medium？
[A]:  Well... I suppose your digital archive does demonstrate a certain respect for textual preservation, not entirely dissimilar to my own efforts in maintaining acid-free editions. Though I draw the line at calling it a 'happy medium' - more of a begrudging technological détente between Gutenberg and this 'blockchain' of yours.  And do keep your voice down about those scans - the rare books librarian would have apoplexy.
[B]: Got it, whisper mode activated~ 😉 说真的，下次如果你来我们hackathon当guest speaker，我们可以准备个特别环节 - "From Quill Pens to Smart Contracts: A Literary Perspective" 📜➡️💻 保证不会让你的rare books librarian朋友知道！
[A]:  How positively subversive of you. Very well - I shall consider this... technological incursion into my ivory tower. But I insist we include a proper demonstration of iron-gall ink preparation as counterbalance. And absolutely no emojis on the presentation slides - that's my final condition. 🖋️ (This singular exception proves the rule, you understand)
[B]: Deal！No emojis... except maybe just one tiny 🚀 when we talk aboutfuture of publishing？Okay okay，just kidding！我会准备些real parchment和quill pen当backup的~ 毕竟就像coding一样，sometimes the old ways still have their charm ✨ (最后那个sparkle不算emoji，是typographical ornamentation，对吧？)
[A]:  Your semantic gymnastics would put the Oxford English Dictionary editors to shame. Very well - a single typographical sparkle, provided it's rendered in proper Garamond. And do bring that parchment; I'll demonstrate why Jane Austen never needed a 'blockchain' to achieve immortality. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a first edition of 'Wuthering Heights' that's giving me the side-eye from across the room.
[B]: Roger that！📜✒️ 我会把Garamond的font size调成跟你的quill pen strokes完美匹配~ 顺便说一句，你提到'immortality'让我想到，我们最近正在develop一个decentralized archiving protocol...啊！ 好好好，这个话题留到下次tea time再聊！Enjoy your date with Heathcliff 😉
[A]:  Your restraint is... noted. And for the record, my assignation with Mr. Heathcliff involves textual analysis, not your infernal 'protocols'. Do bring Earl Grey to our next encounter - the bergamot aroma might just soften the shock of whatever technological heresy you're brewing. Good day. 
[B]: Copy that - Earl Grey with extra bergamot it is! ☕️ 我会把它和我的Raspberry Pi一起pack好~ 祝你跟Heathcliff的textual analysis约会愉快！（这次真的last message了，promise！）
[A]:  Your binary humming is scanning as iambic pentameter... how peculiar. Until next time,  technophile.  The moors await.
[B]: （在门口探头）Aha！所以iambic pentameter本质上就是literary Morse code嘛~ 📚➡️🔢 这个discovery值得写篇paper！ 记得我们的Earl Grey约定！
