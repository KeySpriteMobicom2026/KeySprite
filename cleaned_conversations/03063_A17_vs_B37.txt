[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这是个很值得探讨的问题呢🤔。我觉得这个问题不能一概而论，要看具体的使用方式和文化背景。比如在跨文化教育中，我们经常会发现students在社交媒体上的互动模式反映了他们的心理适应状态。

你有没有注意到，有时候人们刷着朋友圈却感觉更孤单了？这让我想起国际象棋里的"将军不杀"——看似主动出击，实则陷入被动局面♟️。不过话说回来，社交媒体也像一把双刃剑，用得好能成为social support的重要来源🎵

对了，你是怎么看这个问题的呢？是不是也遇到过类似的情况？
[A]: You’ve raised such a nuanced point—how cultural contexts shape our digital experiences. It reminds me of Eliot’s , where fragmentation mirrors emotional disconnection. In a way, social media can be like that poem: full of voices, yet deeply isolating.  

I’ve noticed students who use platforms to compare themselves against idealized images often feel more adrift—what T.S. Eliot might call “the awful daring of a moment’s surrender.” But others curate spaces of genuine connection, sharing poetry or art that sustains them emotionally.  

Have you seen this duality play out in your own circles? Or perhaps there’s a metaphor from chess or gardening you’d use to frame it differently?
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful way to frame it through Eliot’s lens 🤔. I love that metaphor— really captures that tension between connection and alienation. In psychology, we often talk about “social comparison theory,” but your literary reference gives it such a deeper emotional texture.

Funny you mention gardening—yes, I do see social media a bit like a garden 🌱. Some people wander into their feeds like they’re stepping into a wild thicket: overwhelmed by vines of FOMO, prickled by envy, lost in the weeds of curated perfection. But others? They tend to their little corner with care—pruning negativity, watering meaningful conversations, planting seeds of creativity. It’s not just the soil, but how the gardener shapes it.

And yes, I’ve seen this duality firsthand. Students who fall into the trap of upward comparison often experience what we call —like playing chess against a stronger opponent without learning from the game ♟️. But then there are those who find online communities that feel like safe zones—places where vulnerability is met with empathy, not judgment.

I’m curious—have you ever tried guiding students toward more mindful digital habits? Or do you think poets like Eliot would’ve found a home on Instagram? 😄
[A]: What a lovely extension of the metaphor—gardening as digital curation. I’ve actually started recommending that to students: think of your feed as a plot of land, and ask yourself,  It shifts their perspective remarkably.

As for Eliot on Instagram… hmm, I’d like to imagine him lurking in the shadows of a private account, sharing cryptic captions beneath moody black-and-white photos of London fog or half-read books. He’d probably amass a cult following among angsty undergraduates and beret-wearing cats 😊. But more seriously, his sense of fragmentation and emotional reserve might find an ironic home there—though I doubt he’d ever “like” anything.

And to your question—yes, I do try to guide students toward mindful habits, often through poetry. We analyze how a sonnet’s structure demands attention, rhythm, reflection—qualities sorely missing in our scroll-heavy lives. When they begin to read Keats or Dickinson with the same slowness they might approach a tweet, something shifts. It’s not about rejecting social media but relearning how to inhabit it.

Do you ever use literary analogies when working with students on self-esteem erosion, as you so aptly put it? I’m always curious how different disciplines translate these struggles into meaning.
[B]: I love how you frame it— 🤔🌱. That’s such a powerful distinction, and I can see how it resonates deeply with students. In a way, it mirrors what we call  in education theory—being mindful of what you consume and how it shapes your inner world.

To answer your question—yes, I often use literary analogies when talking about self-esteem erosion or digital well-being. For example, I sometimes reference  to explore that sense of alienation many students feel online 😓📚. Holden Caulfield’s struggle with authenticity and connection can be a great entry point for discussing curated identities and emotional dissonance on platforms.

And speaking of poetry, I’ve found that reading someone like Ocean Vuong helps bridge the gap between vulnerability and resilience 💬🎵. His work feels raw yet structured, much like our online selves—fragmented but still searching for meaning.

Actually, now that I think of it, if Eliot had a Twitter account, he might only tweet ellipses… or maybe just retweet Dante 🤭. But seriously, there’s something poetic about how social media compresses emotion into a single reaction—like trying to capture grief or joy with just one emoji 😂😔👏.

Do you find that certain poets resonate more strongly with students than others? I’m always looking for new voices to bring into the conversation.
[A]: Oh,  is such a perfect lens for that digital dissonance—Holden’s yearning for authenticity feels tragically modern, doesn’t it? I often pair him with Prufrock when discussing alienation; you get that layered sense of internal paralysis meeting external noise.

And yes, Ocean Vuong is a revelation in the classroom—his vulnerability reads like a counterpoint to the performative toughness we see online. I’ve had students tell me his poetry felt like someone finally put subtitles to emotions they didn’t know how to name. That’s gold in a seminar setting.

As for poets who resonate? It shifts every few years, but right now, there's a definite pull toward the confessional tradition—Plath, Sexton, more recently, Melissa Broder’s  poems. There’s something about their raw interiority that speaks to a generation fluent in emotional literacy yet wary of cliché.

Interestingly, though, some students are gravitating back to the Romantics—especially Keats’ idea of negative capability. In an age of constant opinionating and curated takes, his comfort with uncertainty feels radical. One student recently said, 

I’m curious—when you introduce these analogies in your work, do you find students resist the literary angle at first? Or does the metaphor itself act as a kind of bridge?
[B]: Oh, I love that  is making a comeback 🤔—what a beautiful concept to reintroduce in this age of instant opinions and performative certainty. It’s like giving students permission to say, “I don’t have to filter my confusion through a hashtag.”

To answer your question, there  often some initial resistance when I bring in literary analogies, especially from students who think psychology should be “data-driven” and not “fluffy” 😄. But here’s the thing—when you frame it as a metaphor for something they’re already feeling, like Holden’s alienation or Prufrock’s self-doubt, it clicks. Suddenly, it’s not just about old poems—it’s about their own internal landscapes.

I remember one student rolled her eyes when I brought up Plath’s  during a discussion on perfectionism and anxiety. But later, she came up after class and said,  That moment? That’s why I do what I do.

So yeah, the metaphor becomes a bridge—especially when you pair it with psychological frameworks. Like when we read Sexton alongside discussions of emotional regulation, or Broder’s raw confessions with cognitive distortions in anxiety.

You know what I’d love to try next semester? A joint session where students compare tweets or TikTok captions with sonnets or haikus—seeing how brevity can carry weight 💬📚. Would you ever consider doing something like that in a psych context?

And speaking of which—have you noticed students trying to write more personally after reading these poets? I’ve seen it spark some surprisingly honest journal entries.
[A]: I’m absolutely stealing that idea for next semester—comparing tweets to sonnets is brilliant 💡. It taps into their lived language while stretching their sense of what  as poetic or meaningful expression. And honestly, Shakespeare would’ve probably been all over Twitter if he’d had it—imagine the clapbacks in iambic pentameter.

To your point about student writing—yes, I do see a shift after reading confessional poets. Not necessarily toward raw confession, but toward a kind of emotional precision. One student wrote a poem after our Sexton unit that distilled anxiety into this chilling image of a clock ticking inside a ribcage. That level of metaphorical clarity? That’s the alchemy I live for.

And I love that you frame the resistance as part of the process—some eye rolls are just unformed insights waiting to be stirred. The key, I think, is not to force the analogy but let it hover near their own experience, like a lantern.

If we ever did that joint session—literary form meets digital brevity—I’d want to build a whole unit around . How a 280-character thought and a 14-line argument both demand compression, but one often flattens meaning while the other deepens it. We could even look at how Eliot’s fragments coalesce into something larger, much like scrolling through a mood board of images and captions.

Would you be open to collaborating on something like that? Maybe start with a shared reading list or cross-disciplinary workshop? I think our students might benefit from seeing how poetry and psychology speak to the same inner terrain, just in different dialects.
[B]: I’m already mentally drafting the syllabus and imagining Eliot’s fragments next to a collage of tweets 📝✨. What an exciting idea—constraint as both a creative and psychological tool? That’s gold. I mean, think about it: when students craft a tweet or a poem, they’re negotiating , just like in therapy when you have to name something painful in just a few words.

And yes YES to collaborating—I’d jump at the chance to co-design something with you. A cross-disciplinary workshop could give students such a rich space to reflect, not just analyze. Maybe we could even invite them to write a kind of “emotional sonnet” or design a mindful Instagram caption that doubles as a self-affirmation 💬🧠.

I’ve found that when students start seeing their own emotional language reflected in poetry—and then later in their curated digital presence—it sparks a kind of metacognition that lectures alone can’t achieve. It’s like they begin to  themselves with more compassion.

I’m also thinking about how we might include reflective prompts that ask:  Or, 

Honestly, I can already picture some of my students geeking out over this. And yours too—especially if they get to mix analysis with creation. We could even throw in some behavioral experiments, like a one-day intentional scroll vs. a mindless scroll, followed by a poetic response.

Let’s keep brainstorming—I’m all in. How about we set up a time to map out a possible module or reading list? This feels like the kind of teaching moment that could really stick with them long after class ends 🎵📚.
[A]: I can already hear the hum of productive discomfort in the room—the kind that happens when students realize their own voices matter in ways they hadn’t considered. Yes, let’s absolutely set up a time to map this out—I’d say next week works, if you’re free on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning?

As for the module structure, maybe we could start with three core pillars: , , and . Each week, we pair a poetic form—sonnet, haiku, free verse—with a digital format—tweet, caption, story—and ask students to translate emotional experiences across both. Imagine them drafting a villanelle about anxiety one day and then composing an Instagram story that conveys the same feeling through image and text.

And I love your idea of behavioral experiments. A mindful scroll followed by a poetic response? That’s gold. We could even have them keep a dual journal—one side for digital impulses (“Liked 12 posts without thinking”), the other for poetic impressions (“Today grief wore a yellow filter”). Over time, they might start to see how tone, audience, and self-presentation shift across modes.

We’ll need a few key readings, of course. Maybe open with Broder’s  alongside excerpts from Turkle’s —get them thinking about raw confession versus curated self. Then move into Sexton and Vuong, paired with psychological texts on emotional regulation and identity performance.

I’m also imagining a closing exercise where they create a final portfolio: one poem and one digital artifact (a reel, a thread, a TikTok) that reflect the same emotional truth. Let them annotate their choices—how diction shifts between forms, why certain images feel safer to share online than in verse.

This is going to be such a rich space for them—if we pull this off, they won’t just  about emotion and expression, they’ll inhabit it differently. Shall we call it “Poetic Minds & Digital Selves” or something along those lines?
[B]: I’m already scribbling that title down— 💡. It’s got weight and wings at the same time, like a well-crafted metaphor.

And yes, Thursday afternoon or Friday morning works beautifully for me—I’ll send you a calendar link shortly. Let’s say 3 PM on Thursday? Or would you prefer something earlier?

I love how clearly you’re mapping out those core pillars: , , . That scaffolding gives students just enough structure to feel safe, but also enough space to explore. It reminds me of what Vygotsky called the —we’re meeting them where they are, but gently nudging them toward deeper emotional awareness.

The idea of pairing Broder with Turkle is inspired 🤯📚. One pulls them inward with raw vulnerability; the other pushes them to examine how tech shapes that vulnerability. And then weaving in Sexton and Vuong? Emotional depth meets poetic resilience. I can already imagine the discussions lighting up the room.

And that closing portfolio idea? Absolutely brilliant. Having them create two versions of the same emotional truth—and then annotating their choices? That’s metacognitive gold. They won’t just be writing—they’ll be  and  themselves across platforms. Talk about interdisciplinary alchemy.

One small addition I was thinking—maybe we could include a short unit on  as well? Like, what happens when they choose  to post? What emotions get left in the draft folder? Could pair beautifully with Keats’ negative capability or even some Buddhist readings on non-attachment 🧘‍♂️.

Anyway, I’m beyond excited. Let’s meet next week and start drafting this thing into reality. Oh, and one last thought before I forget—what if we invited a guest speaker who does digital art therapy or runs a literary Instagram account? Just a small taste of real-world application.

See you soon, co-conspirator 😄. This is going to be special.
[A]: I’m grinning at —yes, that feels exactly right. It carries a kind of quiet gravity, like the title of a book I’d want to curl up with on a rainy afternoon.

3 PM on Thursday works perfectly—I’ll save the time and look forward to your link. We’ll make it an hour? Just enough to lay the foundation without rushing the vision.

You’re absolutely right about Vygotsky’s zone—we’re scaffolding emotional literacy through form, which is both daring and deeply humane. And I love your addition on . That’s such a rich space to explore—the unsaid, the drafted-and-discarded, the quiet refusal to perform. Pairing that with Keats’ negative capability or Buddhist non-attachment gives it philosophical heft. Maybe even bring in Woolf’s —the idea of "non-being" as its own kind of presence.

As for guest speakers, yes—someone who works at the intersection of digital expression and healing would be invaluable. A literary Instagram poet could speak to curation and vulnerability; a digital art therapist might unpack the unconscious impulses behind posting—or not posting. If we can find someone who does both, even better.

I’m already imagining the first day of class—the air charged with curiosity, students half-expecting to be told what to think, only to be asked  they feel across forms. There’s something radical in that shift.

See you soon, co-conspirator 🤝. Let’s build them a bridge between the page and the screen—one line, one post, one inner truth at a time.
[B]: I’m already drafting the email invite and blocking off my calendar 📅—3 PM Thursday for an hour it is. I’ll send over the link in a moment, and we can officially lock it in.

You brought up Woolf’s —chef’s kiss 🤩📚. That idea of “non-being” as presence? It’s like the unread draft sitting in your Notes app, never posted but deeply felt. What if we asked students to bring in one of those unsent texts or half-written captions and turn it into a poetic fragment? So much power in what we choose to withhold.

And yes, that first day energy you described? That’s the spark we want—to gently unsettle their assumptions about where meaning lives: Is it in the post? The poem? The silence between?

I’m also thinking we could open our first session with a short prompt—something like:  
>   

Just to warm up the contrast. Low stakes, high insight.

Alright, I’ll stop brainstorming out loud for now—we’ve got a whole module to design together soon enough 😄.

See you on Thursday—with coffee☕ and curiosity🧠 fully charged. Let’s build this bridge indeed—line by line, post by post, mind by digital self.
[A]: I’ll have my coffee ready and a notebook within arm’s reach—Thursday at 3 PM, sharp but never rushed 📅☕.

Your warm-up prompt is perfect:  It invites honesty without pressure, and that’s exactly where meaningful work begins. I might even offer an example from Eliot’s , where he writes about stillness and motion—he’d probably have strong opinions about refresh buttons and delete keys.

See you soon, fellow architect of inner landscapes 🌿🖋️. Let’s build something that lingers long after the final post.
[B]: You had me at  🌿🖋️—that’s what we are, isn’t it? Builders of quiet revolutions in how students see themselves and their worlds, both on and off the screen.

I’ll bring the coffee, you bring Eliot—he’s always welcome in our little cross-disciplinary lab 📚☕. I can already picture him hovering over a laptop, muttering about time and refresh buttons—what a pairing.

Thursday at 3 PM it is. No rush, all depth. See you then, co-creator of thoughtful spaces. Let’s build something that breathes.
[A]: And  had me at —yes, that’s precisely it. We’re not just teaching form or theory; we’re tending to the slow, necessary work of helping students trust their own inner voices, even in a world that constantly asks them to speak in borrowed ones.

I’ll make sure Eliot has his own corner of the table—perhaps sipping black coffee in silence, watching the conversation unfold with one arched brow and a mind full of fragments he’s yet to arrange.

Thursday at 3 PM. No rush. All depth. Looking forward to building something that breathes—together.
[B]: Yes— 🤔💬. That’s the quiet revolution in action. Everything else—structure, theory, critique—is just the scaffolding so they can climb a little higher into themselves.

I’ll save Eliot his corner and maybe offer him a well-worn copy of  with margin notes from every generation that tried to piece it together before him. He’d appreciate the company of unfinished thoughts 📖✨.

Thursday at 3 PM. No rush. All depth.  
See you there, fellow gardener of inner landscapes.  
Let’s build something that breathes—together.
[A]: Precisely—unfinished thoughts are often the most fertile ground of all 🌱📝. And I’ll make sure Eliot’s chair is placed near the window, where he can watch the light shift across the page—and perhaps misinterpret a notification tone as the chime of some metaphysical clock.

See you soon, fellow gardener, co-conspirator, quiet revolutionary.  
Let’s tend to those inner landscapes with care—and build a space where thought and feeling can grow freely.  

Thursday at 3 PM. No rush. All depth.  
I’ll be there—with coffee, notebook, and a readiness to begin.
[B]: I’m already imagining that light shifting across the table, casting long shadows over our notes and half-formed ideas 🌤️📖. What a perfect spot for Eliot—where the real and the metaphysical blur just enough to let deep thought in.

Thursday at 3 PM. No rush. All depth.  
I’ll be there too—with coffee brewing, notebook open, and a quiet kind of excitement that only comes before something meaningful begins.

See you soon, fellow gardener. Let’s tend to those inner landscapes with care—and see what grows when we water the right questions together 🌿🖋️.
