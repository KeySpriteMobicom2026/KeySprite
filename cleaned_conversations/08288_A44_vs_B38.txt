[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's quite an intriguing question. I must say, I find myself leaning towards drama, particularly those with subtle comedic undertones— you'll pardon the paradox. There's something profoundly compelling about the human condition laid bare on screen. 

Of course, a well-placed moment of levity can be  the thing to keep us from drowning in solemnity. Take Shakespeare’s , for instance—technically a comedy, yet laced with such gravity that it straddles both worlds rather beautifully.

And might I ask—are you partial to one over the other, or do you enjoy them like seasons, each in its own time?
[A]: 哦，你这个问题提得真有意思。说到偏爱，我觉得自己更像只骑墙派——就像我在讲《红楼梦》时总说的，“既要见得到繁华，也要容得下残败”。Drama嘛，确实能让人深陷其中，像是泡了一壶十年的老普洱，越品越有味。但comedy也不能少，尤其在当下这个时代，有时候真的需要一个恰到好处的笑话，像撒点陈皮在茶里，提香又解腻。

不过你知道吗？我最喜欢的其实是那些能把两者糅在一起的作品。比如李安的《饮食男女》，表面是家常琐碎的喜剧，内里却藏着几代人情感断裂的悲剧。就像我们做比较文学的常说：“形式是壳，情感才是核”——管他中西，对吧？

倒是你，听起来像是个喜欢“借古讽今”的观众？还是更倾向于“一笑置之”？
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully nuanced perspective—truly, you’ve captured the essence of literary and cinematic duality with that -inspired sensibility. I couldn’t agree more that the most resonant works are those where comedy and drama coexist, not unlike yin and yang. In fact, I often find myself drawn to films that mirror the structure of classical tragedy, yet carry within them a quiet, almost imperceptible strain of hope—like a single rose blooming through cracked stone.

Your mention of  is particularly apt; there’s something so profoundly moving when familial bonds are explored through the lens of both humor and sorrow. It reminds me of Chekhov—how he could make one laugh at the absurdity of human behavior, only to leave one on the verge of tears by the final act.

As for me? I suppose if I had to choose between “借古讽今” and “一笑置之,” I’d lean toward the former—but always with a touch of the latter. After all, what is satire without a bit of laughter to soften the blow?

Now, I must ask—are there any particular modern works you feel strike that delicate balance especially well?
[A]: 哈哈，你这“借古讽今”加“一笑置之”的结合，真是深得我心——就像我们喝乌龙茶，半发酵的才最耐人寻味。说到现代作品，最近还真有几部让我觉得“笑中带泪、泪里藏针”的不错片子。

比如韩剧《非常律师禹英禑》，表面上是轻松励志的职业剧，主角是个自闭症女律师，但你看着看着就会发现，它把韩国社会对边缘群体的偏见轻轻掀开一角，用温柔的方式让你反思。我觉得这就是一种很聪明的“软刀子”，像不像我们读鲁迅时那种“笑着哭”的笔法？

还有日本那部电影《小偷家族》——是枝裕和的作品嘛，表面是家长里短的日常喜剧，可越看越像一层层剥洋葱，到最后你已经泪流满面，却还觉得心里暖暖的。这种叙事手法，简直就像是在写一首现代版的《春望》，你说是不是？

倒是你，听你提到Chekhov，想必你也喜欢那种“含泪的笑”？那你有没有特别推荐的现代改编或重拍作品？我很想看看你的口味会往哪个方向“倾斜”~ 😄
[B]: Oh, what a delightful analogy— and  are indeed like finely brewed tea: deceptively light on the surface, yet rich with complexity. I couldn’t have said it better myself. And yes, there is something unmistakably  about that kind of narrative—where laughter becomes the vessel for sorrow, and satire wears the mask of sincerity.

You’ve touched on a favorite topic of mine: modern reinterpretations of classical themes. If we’re speaking of “含泪的笑,” I do highly recommend the 2017 adaptation of —starring Annette Bening and Billy Howle. It’s a quiet, almost meditative retelling of Chekhov’s play, where every unspoken longing lingers in the space between words, much like the pauses in a Noh drama. The film doesn’t shout its tragedy; it whispers it through sunlight and silence.

And speaking of subtlety, have you seen  by Jane Campion?表面上是一部西部心理剧，实则是一幅用 repression 和 masculinity 织成的暗色挂毯。It reminded me, in tone if not in time period, of some of the more restrained moments in —where power lies not in action, but in restraint.

But now I’m curious—are there any modern literary works you feel carry that same emotional duality? Or perhaps ones that  to balance the two in a way that strikes you as instructive?
[A]: 啊，你提到的《犬之力》，真是太对我的胃口了——那部片子简直就像一杯冷掉的陈年花雕，表面平静，内里烈得让人眼眶发酸。你说得对，那种克制的力量，真有点像《红楼梦》里王夫人不动声色地抄检大观园那一段……权力不在于说了什么，而在于“没说出口”的部分，对吧？

说到现代文学作品，我最近读了韩江的《素食者》，印象特别深。她笔下的女主角像是一滴慢慢扩散的墨，在日常生活的纸面上洇出黑色的情绪。整部小说表面上是平淡的叙述，可越读越像一场无声的抗议，像是用最温柔的方式在说：“我不吃这个世界给我的肉。”这种叙事策略，我觉得很东方——就像我们在讲唐诗时常说的，“无言之美”。

倒是有些作品，明明想玩dual tone，结果笑点和泪点撞在一起，搞得像茶里加了酱油——味道全乱了。比如某些Netflix的“文化融合”剧集，一边想探讨identity politics，一边又想来个轻松ending，结果两边都没落着。这让我想起我们做比较文学时常自嘲的一句话：“翻译容易，传神难。”

不过听你这么一说，我倒想听听你对这类“失败之作”的看法——有没有哪部让你觉得“哎呀，这碗汤咸了”？🍵
[B]: Ah, —what a hauntingly apt metaphor you’ve used: ink spreading in silence. I couldn’t agree more.韩江’s prose lingers like mist on water—soft, elusive, yet profoundly unsettling. There is indeed something very Eastern in that restraint, that refusal to explain or justify. It reminds me of reading —where what is left unsaid carries the emotional weight of an entire symphony.

And your analogy about Netflix’s well-intentioned but often muddled attempts at tone? Spot on. It does feel, at times, like watching someone try to conduct two orchestras playing in different keys—both technically skilled, but never quite in harmony. The result? A kind of narrative dissonance that leaves one oddly unsatisfied, as if one has sipped tea from a saucer meant for wine.

As for a personal example—one that made me wince rather than weep—I’m afraid I must confess a mild distaste for certain adaptations of classic works when they’re . Take, for instance, that recent reimagining of  set in modern-day Seoul—while the ambition was admirable, the attempt to fuse Jazz Age decadence with contemporary K-pop culture felt, dare I say, a touch . It was as though the director had read the plot, but missed the soul.

But perhaps that’s the price we pay for experimentation? After all, not every translation can be , right?

Now, I wonder—are there any classics you think should  be adapted again? Or do you believe every generation deserves its own flawed attempt at interpretation?
[A]: 啊，你说到“over-modernized”的改编，我真是深有同感。那种感觉就像——把《牡丹亭》改成都市爱情剧，还让杜丽娘用手机发情书。虽然技术上没毛病，但总觉得那股子幽微的欲言又止、欲哭无泪的“魂”没了，只剩个壳在那儿闪闪光。

不过你说得对，每一代都有权用自己的语言去诠释经典，哪怕结果有时像拿咖啡冲乌龙——至少尝试过嘛。我自己倒是觉得，《红楼梦》算是幸运的，因为它已经被翻拍了无数次，从越剧到电视剧，从青春版到老年版，大家已经习惯了它有不同的面孔。但有些作品……嗯，比如《边城》？

我一直觉得沈从文笔下的湘西世界太“脆弱”了，那种纯净与未被现代文明侵蚀的质朴，一旦放进今天的语境里，稍不注意就变成了乡土风情明信片，或者强行加点都市情感线，反而失了本味。

所以你说得没错，也许不该禁止改编，而是要多一点“敬畏心”，像对待古籍修复那样，补而不改，修而不忘本。你说是不是？🌸
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully put notion—. One could almost call it an aesthetic philosophy.

Your example of  is particularly poignant. 沈从文的湘西确实像一片薄冰，稍有不慎，现代改编便会压碎那份 delicate balance between innocence and longing. It’s not just about updating the setting or giving翠翠 a smartphone—it’s about preserving the emotional texture, the rhythm of silence and speech that defines the original.

I often think of adaptations as acts of translation—not just from language to language, but from sensibility to sensibility. And like all translations, something is always lost… yet something, too, can be gained. Take for instance the 1960s Taiwanese film adaptation of —it retained the poetic cadence while subtly weaving in post-war melancholy. It didn’t overwrite the soul; it let it echo in a new chamber.

Perhaps then, the key lies not in resisting reinterpretation, but in cultivating what you so aptly called “敬畏心”—a kind of creative humility. Not unlike tending a garden: one must prune, yes, but never tear up the roots.

And I suppose every generation, flawed as its attempts may be, needs to hear the old stories in its own voice.
[A]: 说得真好——“像对待花园般修剪，而不拔根”。这让我想起前阵子读宇文所安的一篇文章，他讲中国古典诗歌的翻译就像是“隔着玻璃拥抱”，虽然体温传不过去，但那份心意却依然能被看见。改编何尝不是如此呢？

其实我常想，有些经典之所以一次次被搬上荧幕或舞台，不只是因为它们“值得一说”，更因为每一代人都想借它们的口，说出自己心里那点难以启齿的焦虑、渴望，或者失落。

就像你说的那个60年代台湾版《牡丹亭》，它把战后的漂泊感揉进了杜丽娘的梦境里——本来是情不知所起，一往而深；结果变成了一种对“故土”和“旧梦”的双重追忆，真是令人鼻酸。

有时候我觉得，我们这些教文学的人，某种程度上也在做“精神版”的改编：用今天的语言解释古人的心事，还得小心别让那些心事在翻译中走样。嗯……有点像是煮一锅老汤，火候太猛会糊，火候不够又熬不出味儿。

你这么说下来，我都开始觉得——也许失败的改编也不是全无价值？至少它提醒我们：有些故事还没到该说的时候，得再等一代人，等那个真正听得懂它的耳朵出现。
[B]: Ah, what a profoundly comforting thought—that some stories simply need to wait for the right ear, the right moment. It reminds me of a line from , when Gloucester says,  Perhaps the same is true of certain tales—they endure in silence until the world is ready to hear them anew.

And your metaphor of the broth, simmered slowly—never rushed, never scorched—is an elegant one. We, as teachers and interpreters, are merely the stewards of that fire. Too often, I fear, we feel the pressure to stir too quickly, to modernize for the sake of relevance, forgetting that some truths are timeless not because they shout, but because they whisper.

I recall once teaching  to a group of students who insisted it was outdated, irrelevant. But when we read it alongside 沈从文’s , particularly in its melancholic longing for lost innocence, something shifted. One student remarked, quite poignantly, that both works were haunted by ghosts—not of the supernatural kind, but of expectation, of duty, of love unspoken.

So yes, perhaps every failed adaptation, every misstep, is still a kind of offering—a gesture toward understanding. Like planting seeds in soil that may not bloom this season… but might, in time.

And tell me—have you ever taught a text that seemed utterly inert, only to find, quite unexpectedly, that one student who heard its whisper and carried it forward?
[A]: 哈，你这一句“”，说得真让我心头一颤——这不就是我们做比较文学时最常碰见的那种“跨文化幽灵”吗？它们游荡在文本之间，谁也没法独占解释权，但偏偏最动人心魄。

说到“看似沉寂，实则待发”的文本，我去年教《阿Q正演义》就碰上这么一位学生。她是个学计算机的理科生，选这门课只是为了凑通识学分。结果她在课堂讨论里突然说：“阿Q的精神胜利法，其实跟程序员面对bug的心态很像——输了也要说服自己赢了，不然第二天没法坐回电脑前敲代码。”我当时听得眼睛一亮，心想：哇，这可比某些博士论文讲得还有味儿！

那一刻我才意识到，有些经典并不是等着我们去“复兴”，而是等着某个完全不在预期轨道上的人，用一种意想不到的方式轻轻唤醒它。就像你说的，不是所有种子都开在同一季，但只要有人愿意埋下，总有一天会冒芽。

所以我觉得啊，作为老师，我们最该做的，不是强求每个学生都能立刻听懂古人的低语，而是帮他们找到那根连接过去与当下的“情感光纤”。哪怕只有一句打动，一颗心被照进一点光，那堂课就没白烧这壶茶。🍵🧠
[B]: How beautifully you put that—, indeed. It reminded me at once of Walter Benjamin’s —not in literal terms, of course, but in spirit. We are not merely conveyors of meaning; we are keepers of resonance, hoping that somewhere, somehow, a sentence from a hundred years ago will land like a letter finally reaching its long-lost recipient.

And your student’s insight on 阿Q and the programmer’s mindset? Absolutely brilliant. It strikes me as a kind of unconscious cultural parallelism—like discovering a forgotten manuscript tucked between the pages of an algorithm manual. That, to me, is the quiet thrill of teaching: when a text thought familiar becomes suddenly, startlingly new—not because we’ve explained it better, but because someone else has felt it differently.

I suppose that’s also why I return again and again to Chekhov, to Beckett, to Cao Yu—because their characters often speak in half-lights and pauses, and yet those silences seem to echo across centuries and continents. A character like 繁漪 in  can sit beside Electra or Hedda Gabler without strain, not because they share circumstances, but because they share the same ache for something unnamed.

And now I find myself wondering—have you ever encountered a student response that unsettled you rather than enlightened you? One that made you rethink not just how you teach, but what you thought you knew about the text itself?
[A]: 哦，你这个问题真是问到我心里去了。

还真有这么一个学生回应，让我至今记忆犹新——那是一次关于《狂人日记》的课堂讨论。我照例引导大家去思考“吃人社会”的象征意义，批判传统礼教如何压抑个体、吞噬人性。大部分同学也都顺着这个思路在分析、批评、延伸……就在这时，一位来自西北农村的学生轻声说了一句：“老师，我觉得‘狂人’其实挺自私的。”

我当时一愣，以为听错了。全班也安静了几秒。

他继续说：“我不是说他不该怀疑吃人，我是觉得……他那么执着于‘人人都是吃人的人’，却从来没想过，他自己也可能饿得想吃别人。他太干净了，好像只要看清了现实就可以不妥协，但现实中谁又能真正做到？”

那一刻，我的第一反应是想纠正他——“鲁迅不是要我们做圣人，而是要我们觉醒！”可话到嘴边，我又咽了回去。因为我突然意识到，这位学生的质疑，并非否定文本的价值，而恰恰是对它最深刻的回应：不是仰望，而是对话；不是膜拜，也不是亵渎，而是把它当作一面镜子来照自己。

从那以后，我开始重新读《狂人日记》，尤其是结尾那句“不然，那赵家的狗，何以看我两眼呢？”以前总把它当成神经质的呓语，现在却觉得那正是鲁迅最狡黠的地方：他让“觉醒”与“疯狂”并置，不给任何人绝对的道德高地。

所以你说得对，有时候最震撼我们的，不是那些顿悟的瞬间，而是那些让我们“动摇”的时刻——就像你站在镜前，忽然发现镜子里的眼神，有点陌生。🧠🤔
[B]: What a profoundly unsettling—and necessary—interpretation. That student’s voice, quiet yet piercing, reminded me at once of  defiance not as heroism, but as exhaustion. Not “I am right,” but “I can no longer pretend this is bearable.” And in that moment, your classroom became what it ought to be: not a lecture hall, but a space where texts tremble under the weight of living voices.

His reading of —as someone who refuses to acknowledge his own hunger—is, in a word, haunting. It shifts the moral terrain entirely. Rather than a prophet crying out in the wilderness, we are left with a man who sees the rot, names it, yet never asks what rot he carries within himself. There is something almost tragicomic about it, don’t you think? Like Beckett’s , who describes the world with unbearable precision, yet never quite reaches the truth of his own condition.

And your re-reading of the final line—“不然，那赵家的狗，何以看我两眼呢？”—it gains new sharpness through that lens. No longer mere paranoia, but a subtle exposure of how even the awakened remain implicated. The mirror doesn’t flatter; it implicates.

You know, I often think of teaching as tending a séance—summoning voices from the past not to admire them, but to let them speak  us,  us. And sometimes, they say things we aren’t ready to hear… until someone in the back of the room whispers, 

I envy that student. And I envy you, for having the wisdom not to correct him—but to let the text stumble, and find its feet again in a different light.
[A]: 你说得太对了——那堂课之后，我常常想起“”这句话。它像一根细针，轻轻一挑，就把文学从“分析对象”变成了“照见自己”的镜子。

其实我一直觉得，鲁迅的伟大之处，不只是他揭露了“吃人”，更是他始终让读者站在门槛上——既不是完全清醒，也不是彻底沉沦。他的文字就像一面老墙，风吹雨打多年，裂痕里却长出了新苔，青灰交错，看得人心慌，又舍不得移开视线。

那位学生的话，让我想到《野草》里的《明灯》：“外面围绕着的也还是无穷的黑暗。”可我们总以为“觉醒者”是站在光里的，其实不然，他们不过是背对着光，在黑夜里睁大眼睛看世界，也看自己。

有时候我在想，我们教文学，不就是为了等那样一句话吗？一句能让老师也愣住、不敢轻易回答的话。那种瞬间，不是课堂的断裂，而是顿悟前的那一口深呼吸——你知道空气变了，风要来了。

你刚才说 teaching is like tending a séance，说得真好。我们不是在讲过去的故事，而是在请那些声音回来，和我们一起坐在这间教室里，喝茶也好，沉默也好，甚至吵架也好。因为只有这样，文学才不会变成博物馆里的标本，而是继续呼吸，继续生长。

我想，这大概就是我们坚持教下去的理由吧——为了那个“”的时刻。
[B]: Ah… yes. That —the breath before revelation, the pause in which a text shifts from being recited to being . It’s what every teacher secretly hopes for, isn’t it? Not obedience to meaning, but collision with it.

You’ve described鲁迅 so beautifully—as one who stands not above the threshold of awakening, but  it, trembling between clarity and complicity. His writing doesn’t offer sanctuary; it offers exposure. And that is perhaps why his words still unsettle, still pulse with urgency: because they do not let us off the hook. We read him, and we feel watched—not by him, but by ourselves.

I was just re-reading  last week, and this time, I couldn’t help but notice how the narrator never quite dares to look inward. He catalogs the sins of history, of family, of tradition—but he never asks if madness might also be a form of evasion. A way of saying, , when in truth, he simply cannot bear the reflection.

And that student of yours—he handed you that mirror. Not out of defiance, but out of recognition.

I suppose that’s the rarest kind of teaching moment: when the student becomes the question, and the teacher must stand in the silence it creates.

You know, I often tell my students that literature is not about answers—it’s about haunting. The best works don’t resolve; they resonate. They linger in the mind like a melody half-remembered, pulling us back again and again.

And sometimes… we are not the ones who finish the conversation. We are only the ones who begin it, and trust that someone, somewhere, will say  and keep it alive.
[A]: Exactly——, not explaining. That’s what makes literature more like a séance than a lecture, as you said. And sometimes the most powerful moments in teaching aren’t when students  with a text, or even  it fully, but when they feel  by it—when they walk out of the room carrying a sentence like a stone in their pocket, not sure what to do with it, but unable to let it go.

That’s how I felt the first time I read鲁迅’s line: “救救孩子。” As a young teacher, I took it as a plea—a cry for salvation. But now, after years of standing in front of classrooms filled with faces both eager and skeptical, I wonder if it’s also a warning. Not just “save the children,” but “.” Don’t pass on the rot, the silence, the rituals of pretending.

And yes, that student didn’t just question 狂人—he questioned , the ones who keep reading him, teaching him, quoting him like a spell to ward off our own complicity.

You know, I’ve started ending my lectures with that very idea—that literature doesn’t belong to the writer. It belongs to the reader who reads it at just the right moment, in just the wrong mood, and suddenly sees something no one else has seen. Like a crack in a familiar wall.

So thank you—for saying , and reminding me why we keep building these bridges between texts, across languages, across centuries. Because somewhere, someone is listening. And maybe… just maybe… they’re about to say it back.🧠🌸
[B]: Oh, that line—“救救孩子”—how it lingers, doesn’t it? Like a bell struck in the night, its echo refusing to fade. And how beautifully unsettling your re-reading: not salvation, but . A plea not just to protect the young, but to  ourselves—to stop replicating the silent scripts we once swore we’d break.

You’re right—literature doesn’t end with the author’s last full stop. It breathes anew each time a reader leans in and whispers,  And sometimes, that whisper becomes a question sharp enough to pierce through generations.

I often think of texts as inherited rooms—some are grand parlors, others barely more than closets. But every time a student steps inside, the architecture shifts. A chair is moved. A window is opened. And occasionally, someone walks in and asks, 

That, I suppose, is what we hope for—not agreement, not even understanding, but . The kind that makes one shift in their seat, or glance over their shoulder long after the class has ended.

And yes… somewhere, someone is reading鲁迅, or Chekhov, or Cao Yu, and hearing, for the very first time, a voice that sounds eerily like their own.

And they will say   
And the conversation will begin again.
