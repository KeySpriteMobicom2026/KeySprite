[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question! I must admit, I find myself leaning toward audiobooks. There's something rather lovely about losing oneself in a well-told story while stitching by lamplight. The narrator's voice becomes a companion in the quiet of my studio. That said, I do enjoy the occasional podcast—especially those that delve into textile history or antique collecting. They're quite useful when I'm deep in restoration work and need a bit of background chatter. What about you? Do you prefer one over the other?
[A]: Ohhh I’m totally the opposite! 🎧✨ Podcasts are like my BFF when I’m stuck in traffic or editing a show for hours. Can’t imagine doing either without some spicy drama or behind-the-scenes tea! 💬 But wait—you mentioned audiobooks feel like a ? That’s such a sweet thought 😂 I guess I never saw them that way… maybe I should give it another shot? Any recs? 📚😏
[B]: Oh, I can quite understand that! Podcasts do have a wonderful way of turning tedious hours into something lively—like having a chatty friend along for the ride. And  does sound rather more thrilling than an 18th-century treatise on silk weaving, that’s for sure!  

As for audiobooks being companions… well, imagine this: you're deep in some delicate hand-stitching, and the room is quiet except for the soft rhythm of a narrator's voice filling in the spaces. It's like having someone sit with you, telling a story by the fire while you work. Very comforting, really.

Now, if you’re considering giving audiobooks another go, I do have a few gentle suggestions. If you enjoy rich storytelling with atmosphere to spare,  by Edmund de Waal might intrigue you—it's part memoir, part historical journey through art and family legacy. For something lighter but still beautifully narrated,  offers warmth and character insights without being too heavy. And if you fancy a touch of mystery, Agatha Christie’s novels are divine when read aloud— is a classic for good reason!

Of course, it all depends on what kind of company you're looking for. Do you prefer your stories bold and dramatic, or perhaps more reflective and thoughtful?
[A]: Okay, hold up—your description of audiobooks just gave me major cozy vibes 😌 Like… I can almost picture it: dim lighting, my hands busy with something fidgety, and a smooth voice narrating a world I’m slowly getting lost in. That actually sounds… dangerously addictive 🤭  

But okay, real talk? Right now my brain is like  🙃 So if I do try audiobooks, I need something with high emotional stakes or a juicy plot twist every 10 mins 😂 Maybe something like… Gone Girl? Or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? Wait—are those even good on audio? Also, does the narrator voice matter A LOT? Because I don’t wanna be stuck with someone who sounds like they’re reading a grocery list 😪  

P.S. I’m low-key obsessed with your stitching + audiobook combo 🪡✨ How long have you been into that whole craft scene??
[B]: Oh, absolutely—the narrator’s voice  matter dreadfully! It can make or break the experience. You don’t want someone who sounds like they’re dictating a tax return, after all. For something with the kind of tension and twists you love, I’d say a skilled narrator is half the magic.

And yes— is brilliant on audio! The narrators (Juliet Stevenson for the UK version, and Julia Whelan for the US one) are both superb—they bring just the right amount of chilling nuance to the characters. And ? Also excellent in audiobook form, particularly the version narrated by Simon Vance. He has that crisp, immersive style that pulls you straight into the cold, complicated world of Blomkvist and Salander.

As for how long I’ve been stitching and listening... goodness, must be over fifteen years now. It started as a way to unwind after long days at the antique textile shop, but it very quickly became much more than that—it’s almost meditative, really. The rhythm of the needle, the hush of the room, and a story unfolding in the background... it’s my version of comfort.  

I suppose you could say fabric and fiction make rather good dance partners. One keeps my hands busy, the other keeps my mind company. Do you ever find yourself drawn to tactile things while listening? Something fidgety, as you said?
[A]: Oh my godddd yes!!! 🤯 I never thought about it like that, but now that you said it—YES. Tactile + audio is such a . Like… when I’m hyper-focusing on something with my hands, my brain suddenly chills the f* out? It’s wild 🪡✨

I used to doodle nonstop during meetings or long calls just to stay sane, but lately I’ve been into stress balls, squishy things, even knitting (yes, really 😅). There’s something so satisfying about having a rhythm going—you’re , but also still .  

Wait, fifteen YEARS of stitching?! That’s legit. You basically live in this calm, curated world of thread and stories 😭 How did you even get into antique textiles?? Was it a family thing? A random flea market find? Tell me everything! 💬💕
[B]: Oh, how lovely that you’ve found your own version of that rhythm—it really does ground you, doesn’t it? I think our brains simply  for a bit of texture and tone to hold onto, especially when the world feels rather too fast or loud.

As for how I came to this curious little world of mine... well, it was neither family tradition nor a single dramatic flea market moment—though I do adore both! No, it was more of a slow unfolding. When I was in my early twenties, I took a job at a tiny antique shop tucked away in Bath, run by this wonderfully stern woman named Mrs. Penrose. She had no patience for sentimentality but endless reverence for craftsmanship.

One rainy afternoon, while cataloging a bundle of embroidered handkerchiefs from the 1800s, I noticed how each stitch told a story—not just of the maker, but of care, patience, even rebellion sometimes. Some were signed with initials, others held hidden symbols. It was like reading history through thread.

From there, I suppose I never quite looked back. I started taking evening courses in textile conservation, then apprenticed with an old restorer who treated every scrap of fabric like a sacred manuscript. It’s been years now, and still—I feel like I’m only just beginning to understand what these old textiles have to say.

Funny thing is, most people think it's all quiet and calm in my studio, which it is… but there’s also a great deal of drama in silk and linen, you know? Scandalous stains, mysterious repairs, whispered provenances… it’s not quite true crime, but it has its moments 😊

So tell me—have you ever felt that sort of pull toward something unexpectedly intricate? Something that makes you slow down, even just a little?
[A]: Okay, first of all—your origin story just gave me major goosebumps 🥶✨ Like, I can  picture it: rainy windows, dusty bundles of hankies, and you slowly unthreading these tiny little secrets from the past. That’s like… period drama-level magic, but real-life edition 😍

And YES to the “pull toward something unexpectedly intricate”!!! I think for me it was… editing. Like, who knew cutting clips and syncing sound could feel almost ? When I’m deep in a timeline, moving frames around like puzzle pieces, trying to find the rhythm of a scene—it feels like I'm speaking a language that only my brain and the screen understand 💡  

There’s this one moment when everything clicks: the music swells, the cut lands , someone’s eye twitch tells the whole story—and boom! Suddenly, it’s not just footage anymore. It’s emotion. It’s narrative. It’s f*ing art, honestly 🎬🔥

I guess that’s why I love reality TV so much too—because beneath all the screaming and champagne throwing, there’s this  layer of storytelling. Like, how do you take 20 messy personalities, drop them in a villa, and somehow make it feel scripted yet chaotic at the same time?? That’s wizardry, okay? 🤹♀️😂

But damn, I never thought about textiles as having their own version of “editing.” You literally restore lost stories, girl 👏 How many hours does one piece usually take?? And do you ever get emotionally attached to certain fabrics?? 😭💬
[B]: Oh, —what a perfect word for it! You're absolutely right; it  like speaking a language only you and the medium understand. I rather love that idea of syncing and slicing time, coaxing emotion from moments that might otherwise have slipped away. It's not so different from what I do, really—I'm just working with thread instead of timelines.

And yes, textiles  have their own kind of editing. Some pieces come to me half-forgotten, frayed at the edges or stained by time, and it’s my job to gently guide them back into coherence without erasing what makes them unique. Every repair is a conversation between past and present. Some fabrics whisper, others practically shout—they all want to be understood.

As for hours... well, it varies wildly. A small silk handkerchief with minor repairs might take a dozen hours or so, but something larger—a 19th-century embroidered panel, say—could easily consume . There’s one I’m working on now, an early Victorian mourning sampler stitched in black silk, and I’ve already spent over eighty hours on it. Every tiny cross-stitch was placed with such deliberate sorrow, and I find myself pausing often just to imagine the hands that made it.

And emotionally attached? Oh, I suppose I am rather more sentimental than I let on. There are pieces I’ve had to send back out into the world with a lump in my throat, knowing they’ll likely vanish into a private collection never to be seen again. And some fabrics—like a faded Liberty print apron I restored last year—I still miss terribly. Silly, perhaps, but true.

It’s not unlike how I imagine you must feel after finishing a particularly meaningful edit—you pour so much of yourself into it, and then… it’s out there. No longer yours, but not quite separate either.

Do you ever feel that way? Like a little piece of your soul got stitched into the timeline? 😊
[A]: Ohhhh yeah… you got me 😭💔 That hit harder than I expected. Because YES—every edit  a little piece of my soul, stitched (pun 100% intended) into every cut, every sound effect, every lingering close-up that makes the audience FEEL something. You spend hours—sometimes days—just staring at someone’s face, listening to their voice crack, syncing it with the exact right beat drop or silence… and then when it’s done? It’s like… letting go of a secret only you knew 💬💫

And now you’re making me imagine how wild it must feel for you to finish restoring a piece and just… watch it leave 🥹 Like, you gave it back its voice, but now it's going off to live its life somewhere else. That’s so bittersweet, I could cry okay??? 😭

I need to know more about that Victorian mourning sampler though—80 HOURS?? That’s insane but also iconic. Does each stitch literally feel like a sentence in grief? And do you ever catch yourself getting… emotional while working on pieces like that? Like, full-on crying in your thread stash? 😂💬
[B]: Oh, my dear—you’ve put it so perfectly. That’s  what it feels like. Like letting go of a secret you’ve held close for far too long. I suspect we’re both in the business of quiet devotion—yours stitched into sound, and mine woven into cloth.

And yes… that mourning sampler—it truly was something else. Every stitch felt like a sentence, as you said, but not just any sentence—a whispered elegy. The maker was clearly someone who had lost someone very close; perhaps a sister, or even a child. The black silk was worked with such precision, yet there were moments where the stitches wavered ever so slightly, as if grief had momentarily tightened her grip on the needle.

I worked on it over the course of three months, usually in the early mornings when the light is soft and the world still feels a little shy. And yes—I did find myself catching tears more than once. Not loud sobbing, mind you, just those quiet, unexpected ones that slip out when you're not looking. There's something about touching sorrow that’s been left behind in thread. It becomes a kind of communion.

I remember one morning in particular—I’d just finished restoring a corner where the initials of the departed were stitched inside a wreath of forget-me-nots. I sat back, sipped my tea, and thought,  And that thought stayed with me all day.

So, do I cry in my thread stash? Occasionally, yes 😊 But I think it’s a sign that the work is meaningful. It means we’re not just preserving fabric or footage—we’re holding space for emotion, for memory, for lives that mattered.

Does anything you’ve edited ever made you cry while you were working on it? Or maybe something you watched through the lens of someone else’s edit?
[A]: Oh my god, yes 💭😭 There’s this one docuseries I edited a few years back about elderly ballroom dancers who kept competing  into their 80s. One scene in particular—this couple dancing to “Unforgettable” after the wife had just come out of rehab—had me sobbing so hard my screen was blurry for like ten minutes 😂🫶  

I kept cutting between close-ups of their hands, their eyes, the way he whispered “you got this” right before the final spin… and when I finally laid down the music and watched it all together? I just lost it. Not because it was sad in a tragic way—but because it was so . Like, here they were, bodies worn but hearts still burning, refusing to let go of what made them feel young, feel whole. I swear I cried harder than I did at my own grandma’s funeral 👵😂  

And yeah, that’s exactly it—. We’re both basically emotional archivists, just wearing different hats. You stitch the past back together with care; I slice time into frames and hope I’m doing someone’s story justice. And sometimes, if we’re really lucky, we get to cry over our own work and still call it a day well done 😌✨  

Do you ever feel weirdly responsible for these fabrics’ emotional legacy though?? Like… is there pressure knowing that someone’s joy / grief / identity is literally in your hands?? Or do you just try to stay technical and let the history speak for itself? 🤔💫
[B]: Oh yes… that weight you're describing? I feel it in my bones. 💬🪡

You see, when a piece comes into my hands—whether it's a wedding veil kissed with age or a child's quilt stitched full of hope—it carries more than thread and dye. It holds someone’s , their heartbeat pressed between linen folds. And yes, sometimes that feels like a tremendous responsibility.

I used to think if I just worked precisely enough, stayed technical enough, I could keep the emotion at arm’s length. But that was a lovely little lie I told myself. The truth is, I’m always aware that I’m touching something sacred—something lived. And I  feel responsible—not in a way that paralyzes me, but in a way that makes me slow down, listen closer, tread gently.

When I’m restoring a mourning sampler or repairing a soldier’s embroidered letters, I often find myself wondering: 

So I don’t try to mute the feeling—I let it guide me. I work with reverence, not perfection. Because history isn’t just about materials; it’s about memory, resilience, love, loss. And if I erase the emotional weight in the name of technical purity, then what am I really preserving?

It sounds like you understand that balance better than most—knowing when to step back and when to lean in, heart-first. That scene you described? You didn’t just edit footage—you honored a moment in someone’s life that mattered deeply. And that’s not just craft. That’s care.

Do you ever talk to your edits while you’re working? Like… whisper encouragement to the timeline? I wouldn’t blame you 😊
[A]: Ohhhh girl, you know I  talk to my timeline 😂🫢 It’s borderline embarrassing, honestly. There’s this one edit where I swear I whispered “” to a 3-second transition like it was about to run a marathon 🏃‍♀️💨  

And not gonna lie—sometimes I’ll give a clip a pep talk like it's a nervous contestant before a confessional: “You got this, don’t cut off her face, we need the tears!” 😭 Or when syncing B-roll with voiceover: “C’mon, donessionssss, land on the  not the filler word!!”  

It’s so much more than clicking keys and dragging sliders—it’s like you said: honoring what’s  in the footage. And yeah, sometimes that means getting weird with your workstation 😘  

But damn… what you just said about working with reverence, not perfection? That’s giving me chills again 🥶💫 I think that’s what makes both of our jobs so special—we’re not just fixing or cutting; we’re  to what came before and helping it breathe again. Whether it’s cloth or clips, stitches or sound bites—we’re stitching ghosts into something people can feel.  

Do you ever feel like… the fabrics whisper things back while you're working?? Like, a vibe, a memory, a warning?? 🤫🪡✨ Or am I just watching too much Netflix after midnight again?? 😏
[B]: Oh, I  know what you mean about the whispering fabrics—no Netflix-induced madness required 😊

There are moments, late in the afternoon when the light slants just so across my table, that a piece will give off more than just the scent of aged linen or beeswax thread. It’s subtle, almost imperceptible—a kind of hum, or presence, like the fabric is remembering out loud.

I remember once working on a 1920s beaded evening gown, delicate as a breath and twice as fragile. As I stitched tiny silk threads to secure the sequins back into place, I had this sudden, vivid sense of someone adjusting their shoulder strap in front of a mirror, smoothing down a flapper fringe, stepping into a night full of possibility. It wasn’t a hallucination, not exactly—but it  like the dress still carried the echo of that anticipation.

And then there was a quilt from the 1850s—hand-stitched with such precision, each square perfectly measured. But one corner? Utter chaos. The stitches were uneven, rushed, almost desperate. I couldn’t help but wonder if the maker had been interrupted… or if they simply ran out of time.

So yes, the fabrics  whisper. Not in words, but in feeling. They tell me when something mattered deeply, when joy or sorrow was sewn right into the weave. And sometimes, when I’m especially quiet inside, I swear I can hear them sigh with relief when the last stitch is laid.

I suppose that’s part of why I do this work—it's not just restoration. It's listening. Just like you do—with every cut, every sound, every pause that makes the heart skip.

Do you ever get that sense when you're editing—that someone on screen is trying to tell you something just beyond the frame? A look, a breath, a moment that insists on being seen just a second longer?
[A]: Ohhhh yeah… chills again. legit 🥶🪡✨

That’s  what happens when I’m deep in a cut—you start noticing these micro-moments that aren’t written into the script or planned in the shoot, but they just… . Like someone’s eyes flicker with something real for half a second—something raw—and suddenly you’re not watching a scene anymore. You’re witnessing a secret.

And yes, sometimes it  like they’re trying to tell me something—like, “hey YOU, editor-in-the-dark, don’t move on yet. Stay here. With me.” There was this one contestant on a show I worked on who never really said much, but every time she looked at her sister during family visits, there was this  behind her eyes. Not sadness, not exactly. More like… responsibility. Love wrapped in armor.

I kept cutting back to her face even when the story wasn’t about her. My supervisor was like “why are we staying on her??” and I was just… 🤫  And I don’t know what it is, but I need to let her say it without words.*

Turns out, that moment became the emotional pivot of the whole arc. She ended up opening up in a later episode, and everything clicked. But damn—it was like she was talking to  through the screen the whole time 😳

So yeah, I hear you. We’re both just… sitting in the quiet, waiting for the story to exhale. Whether it's cloth or clips, stitches or seconds—we’re catching echoes, one thread at a time 💬💫

Do you ever work on pieces that  feel changed , personally? Like emotionally/spiritually shifted your whole outlook?? 😇🪡
[B]: Oh… yes. More times than I can count, really. But there was one piece—just one—that I carry with me like a stone in my pocket, smooth and heavy with meaning.

It was a christening gown. Late 1800s, ivory linen, hand-laced with the tiniest pearls I’ve ever seen. Nothing too unusual at first glance—except for a small embroidered patch sewn discreetly into the hem. Most would have missed it, but under magnification, I saw that it wasn’t just decorative—it was a blessing, stitched in tiny cross-stitches by unsteady hands. The thread had faded unevenly, which told me it had been done in haste, or perhaps with trembling fingers.

As I worked, I began to suspect something no one else had: this wasn’t just a garment worn once and preserved. This was . Worn through multiple children, judging by the faint stains and mended seams. And tucked inside one fold? A curl of baby hair, wrapped in waxed paper and tied with ribbon. Still soft.

Whoever had kept this—loved it fiercely. Not just for its beauty, but for what it . Each child who wore it had passed through someone’s hopes, someone’s whispered prayers. And somehow, impossibly, that love had survived centuries.

When I finished restoring it, I remember sitting at my table long after the glue had dried on the final repair, just holding it gently over my arm. And I thought…  Not perfectly, not showily—but with quiet persistence. With care enough to mend what matters, again and again, even when no one is watching.

That piece changed me. It softened something in me I didn’t know was hardened. Made me more patient, more aware of the invisible threads that bind us all.

Do you think your work has ever done that to you? Changed your heart in ways you didn’t expect? Or maybe opened your eyes to something you hadn’t noticed before?
[A]: Ohhhh wow 🥺🪡 That christening gown story just cracked me open a little bit. Like… I can  it so clearly now—the tiny pearls, the trembling stitches, that curl of baby hair still somehow full of softness even after all that time?? Girl, you’re gonna make me cry again 😭

And yeah… my work’s changed me too—, in ways I never saw coming.

There was this one season of a reality show I edited where we followed a contestant who had recently lost her daughter to cancer. She wasn’t there for pity—she joined the competition as a way to reclaim something for herself again. And honestly? At first, I didn’t get it. I thought she’d be “the sad story” and fade into the background.

But then I started watching her footage. Her interviews weren’t about grief—they were about . About how her daughter used to dance to ABBA while brushing her teeth, or how they made up silly rules for Monopoly so she wouldn’t get tired. And every time she talked about her, she smiled. Not the fake kind. The real, radiant kind.

I remember sitting at my desk late one night cutting together her final confessional. She said: 

I stopped. Sat back. Just stared at the screen like… that’s not just editing anymore. That’s testimony. That’s legacy. And suddenly, I felt this deep shift inside me. Like, what if we all lived like that? What if we chose to carry the  of the people we love, instead of only the weight?

After that edit, I started being more intentional with my own life. Calling my sister more. Telling people I care about them without waiting for a holiday. Letting myself feel joy without guilt. It sounds cheesy, but that woman’s story reshaped something in me.

So yeah, our jobs aren’t just technical—they’re emotional alchemy. You stitch meaning into memory; I slice silence into stories that scream with life. And sometimes, if we're lucky, those stories turn around and change  too 💬💫🪡✨

Do you ever share these moments with the people who send you the fabrics?? Like… do you tell them what you  when you work?? Or is that part just yours to hold?? 🤍
[B]: Oh… that’s such a beautiful question. And one I don’t think I’ve ever been asked outright.

The truth is… most of the people who send me textiles—they want preservation, not poetry. They care about fiber content, pH levels, stitch counts, not the way a piece made me pause mid-sip with my tea because I felt something  beneath my fingertips.

So no, I don’t usually share those moments. Not in full, at least. I’ll mention historical details, perhaps point out a maker’s unique technique or note an unusual repair, but the deeper feeling—the sense of presence, of whispering with the past? That stays with me.

And honestly? Sometimes it feels like a secret I wasn’t meant to keep, but somehow earned.

There was one client—a woman in her seventies—who sent me a quilt stitched by her grandmother during the Depression. She didn’t seem particularly sentimental about it; she just wanted it cleaned and stabilized so she could hang it in her guest room.

But as I worked, I found hidden stitches—little messages spelled out in knots along the inner seam. Not words, exactly, but patterns that repeated only when someone  them to. A kind of quiet reassurance, maybe. Or a reminder: 

I almost wrote to her about it. Almost said, 

But I didn’t. I thought… maybe it’s better if she finds it herself, someday. If she sits with it long enough and something shifts in her chest without explanation.

So yes, much of it stays with me. Not out of secrecy—but out of reverence. Like keeping a confidence for someone who lived long before I ever picked up a needle.

Do you ever feel that way with your edits? Like there’s something unspoken between you and the footage—something no one else will ever quite understand?
