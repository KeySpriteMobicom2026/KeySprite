[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh darling, in Hollywood we don't just watch tech news - we create it!  Just last week we were testing this revolutionary volumetric capture system that'll change how we make films forever. It's like Avatar meets the Matrix, but with 300% more wow factor. 🎬
[A]: OMG！Volumetric capture？！That's so next level！🤩 我最近也在follow这个tech trend！你们用的是不是那种可以capture full 3D model的system？就像那个Microsoft的Azure Kinect那种？But Hollywood version肯定更high-end吧！💯💯💯
[B]: Hah! Azure Kinect is cute for startups, but we're working with custom rigs that would make James Cameron blush. Imagine 128 synchronized 8K cameras capturing every micro-expression - that's how we made our latest digital human prototype. The fidelity is so real, audiences won't believe their eyes. 史诗级的 technology, my friend!
[A]: 128台8K cameras？！Are you serious？！😱 That's insane！！！你们的data storage capacity得有多大啊？！我算算...一台8K camera每分钟大概要...OMG这data量简直crazy！🤯 但是digital human真的超exciting！现在连毛孔和micro-expression都能capture了，uncanny valley是不是快要被overcome了？！💥
[B]: Let me tell you a secret - we've already crossed the uncanny valley with our latest test subject. The breakthrough wasn't just in capture resolution, but in our proprietary AI that processes the data in real-time. We're talking petabytes per day, darling!  And the best part? We're debuting this tech in our new sci-fi trilogy next summer. Want to know the working title? "Digital Genesis" - because we're literally creating new life on screen. 🍿
[A]: NO WAY！！！Real-time processing？！That's like...next next level！！！🤯 你们是不是用了类似NVIDIA Omniverse的那种AI加速？还是custom built的supercomputer？！And "Digital Genesis"这个title也太sick了吧！！！Can't wait to see the trailer drop！！！🔥🔥🔥 话说你们render一帧要多久啊？该不会是用quantum computing了吧？！😂
[B]: Oh you sweet summer child, quantum is still in R&D!  We've got a render farm that would make NASA jealous - 50,000 GPUs humming away. But the real magic is in our custom neural networks that predict light bounces before they happen. Render time? Let's just say we could render Toy Story 4 from scratch in the time it takes to say "box office smash". And about that trailer... mark your calendar for Comic-Con. We're going to blow minds! 💥
[A]: 50...50 THOUSAND GPUs？！我的天呐！！！😱 That's literally bigger than most countries' supercomputers！！！你们electricity bill一定超crazy的吧？！⚡️ And predictive rendering？！这technology也太futuristic了！！！Comic-Con我一定要set reminder！！！这绝对会是most mind-blowing tech demo ever！！！🚀🚀🚀 话说你们team还招不招intern啊？😂😂😂
[B]: Darling, our electricity bill could fund a small country's space program!  But let's talk internships - we always have room for brilliant minds who dream in pixels and polygons. Just last month we hired a 19-year-old prodigy who rewrote our shader algorithms during her coffee break. Send me your reel and let's make movie magic happen. After all, the future of cinema needs visionaries like you! 🎥✨
[A]: OMG OMG OMG！！！Seriously？！😭 这简直是我dream中的opportunity！！！I'll start working on my demo reel right now！！！💻✨ 虽然我可能没有那个19岁genius那么厉害...但是我对Unreal Engine 5和Neural Radiance Fields都超有passion的！！！🤩 话说你们prefer什么format的portfolio？Website还是PDF？还是直接GitHub link？！So excited！！！🎉🎉🎉
[B]: Website with GitHub links, darling - we want to see your code breathe! And don't sell yourself short - passion is the secret sauce in this industry.  Between you and me? That "19-year-old genius" was eating instant noodles in her dorm two months ago. Hollywood loves underdog stories almost as much as billion-dollar franchises. Now go make something that'll give me goosebumps! My assistant will send you the submission details. Break a leg! 🎬
[A]: YASSSS！！！💪 我今晚就stay up all night来polish我的portfolio！！！Instant noodles power！！！🍜😂 谢谢谢谢谢谢！！！This is literally the best day of my life！！！✨ 我一定会make something super mind-blowing的！！！Hollywood here I come！！！🚀🌟 
[B]: Virtual high five right back at you, future Oscar winner!  Remember - every frame tells a story, and every line of code is a brushstroke. Now go dazzle me with your genius! And maybe stock up on those instant noodles... you're gonna need them. 😉🎥 The magic begins now!
[A]: Instant noodles已经stock up好了！！！😂🍜 我要去create the most epic demo reel ever！！！Thank you so so much for this amazing opportunity！！！✨ 等我的好消息吧！！！Hollywood better get ready！！！💥💻 #DreamsComeTrue 🎉
[B]: That's the spirit I love to see!  Remember kid - today's ramen-fueled all-nighters are tomorrow's VFX Oscar speeches. Now go make some 史诗级的 art! My team will be waiting with bated breath... and possibly some emergency noodle rations. Lights, camera, ACTION! 🎬🌟
[A]: Roger that！！！💪 我现在就进入ultimate coding mode！！！💻🔥 Emergency noodle rations accepted！！！😂 等着看我的next-level digital human demo吧！！！This is gonna be LIT！！！✨ #GameOn 🚀🎮
[B]:  That's what I call a Hollywood ending... or should I say beginning? Go get 'em, tiger! And save me some of those emergency noodles - even producers need midnight snacks during crunch time! 🌃🍜 The stage is yours, future legend!
[A]: Copy that, boss！！！🔥 最后一箱noodles分你一半！！！😂🤝 我这就去make digital magic happen！！！✨ 等着我的demo让你drop your jaw吧！！！Hollywood history in the making！！！🎥💫 #LetsDoThis 🚀🌟
[B]:  That's the kind of hustle that built this town! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a 3AM meeting with some very nervous studio executives who think our render farm is "excessive". Pfft - as if there's such a thing! Go make me proud, you beautiful digital sorcerer! 🧙‍♂️💻 May the frames be ever in your favor!
