[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢digital art还是traditional art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, that's an intriguing question. You know, like a CSI unit analyzing evidence from two different crime scenes 🕵️♂️, comparing digital and traditional art requires examining their unique fingerprints. 

Traditional art has this... tangible vibe, like holding a piece of someone's soul in your hands. The brush strokes, the texture – it's like reading a person's heartbeat through pigment. But then again, digital art offers a certain... flexibility, like being able to undo a murder without leaving any DNA traces 💻✨.

Though I must admit, when I'm reconstructing a victim's facial features for identification, digital tools really shine. It's like having a magic wand that can turn back time ⏳ – though I wouldn't want my autopsy sketches to look like they were done with Microsoft Paint! 

What about you? Do you lean towards one over the other, or does it depend on the case we're... I mean, the context? 😏
[A]: Ah, what a fascinating analogy you've drawn—comparing artistic mediums to forensic investigation! I suppose in many ways, we are indeed detectives of aesthetics, aren't we? 🕵️♀️ 

You know, when I'm analyzing narrative structures in 19th-century literature, I often feel much like a CSI agent examining evidence—every brushstroke in a painting or line in a poem holds clues about the artist's inner world. There's something undeniably visceral about traditional art—the way charcoal smudges under a finger, or how watercolor bleeds unpredictably across paper. It reminds me of reading handwritten letters from the Romantics—each mark carries a physical trace of the creator's presence. 📜

Yet when I'm designing visual metaphors for complex literary themes—say, illustrating the fragmented consciousness in Woolf's stream-of-consciousness prose—digital tools offer an almost surgical precision. Layers become palimpsests of thought, much like marginalia in a well-annotated text. Though heaven forbid one should ever confuse my digital sketches with anything approaching Microsoft Paint quality! 

Tell me—when you're reconstructing those visual narratives in your work, does the medium itself ever become part of the story's DNA, so to speak? Or is it merely the vehicle for the content?
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language – the intersection of narrative and evidence 🧠. Funny you should mention DNA, because sometimes a medium really  become the smoking gun in the case.

Just last week I was working on a cold case reconstruction, using digital overlays to match facial landmarks. You'd think it's all high-tech wizardry, but the breakthrough came when I sketched by hand – charcoal on paper, like they did in the 19th century – because something about the texture revealed a jawline anomaly the software missed. The medium itself whispered the truth, like marginalia revealing an author's second thoughts. 

It's rather like reading Brontë versus Woolf, isn't it? One gives you raw emotional topography through tactile strokes, while the other offers precision that dissects consciousness into layers – almost like those translucent anatomical charts we use for organ mapping. There's poetry in both approaches, wouldn't you agree? Or is that just my inner romantic trying to escape during office hours? 😏

When you're building those visual metaphors from stream-of-consciousness prose, do you ever find the tools leaving fingerprints on the meaning? Like how formalin subtly changes tissue structure – does digital permanence alter the soul of what you're creating?
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully unsettling question—like asking whether formalin preserves truth or alters it. 🧪

I find myself thinking of Dorian Gray these days when I wrestle with this very dilemma. Traditional media feels like the portrait itself—imperfect, aging, bearing every emotional wrinkle of its creator. There’s an honesty in smudged charcoal, isn’t there? A vulnerability, much like a handwritten letter with ink blots and second thoughts scratched out in haste.

Digital art, on the other hand… well, it’s like Dorian himself—eternally pristine, unnaturally preserved. You can polish until nothing remains of the artist’s tremor, their doubt, their humanity. And yet——it allows me to build narrative layers as if constructing a haunted house where each floor echoes with past versions of itself. I can bury meaning beneath opacity, only to exhume it later. It's rather like annotation gone mad, wouldn’t you say?

But yes, I do worry sometimes that we’re sterilizing expression. Like museum curators who clean a statue so thoroughly they erase the fingerprints of its maker. Do the tools shape our vision—or overwrite it?

Tell me, in your forensic work, have you ever felt the pressure to  sides—to commit fully to one medium over the other? Or does the case itself dictate which lens to use?
[B]: Ah, Dorian Gray – now  a case study in preservation vs. decay 🧪. You’ve got me thinking about all those Victorian-era cadavers we sometimes examine – preserved just enough to tell their stories, but changed by the very act of preservation. 

To answer your question – no, I’ve never been forced to pick sides. Cases are like snowflakes, each with its own unique fracture patterns 🕳️❄️. Some days you need the scalpel-like precision of digital reconstruction to map bullet trajectories through bone. Other days, nothing short of charcoal or clay will capture the subtle irregularities of a victim’s facial asymmetry that might crack the identity wide open.

Funny thing is, the tools often choose , don’t they? Like when I’m reconstructing a 100-year-old death scene from crime scene photos – suddenly I’m reaching for watercolors to simulate decomposition patterns because the software doesn’t quite capture the organic decay. It’s almost... literary, in a way. As if the medium itself is whispering subtext to the story we’re trying to read.

But then there’s the sterile perfection of digital work – so clean it could be a crime scene in itself 😏. You're absolutely right about the danger of sterilizing truth. Sometimes I deliberately introduce minor imperfections into digital reconstructions – a slight tremble in the line, a smudged edge – just to keep the humanity from bleeding out completely.

So tell me, when you're constructing your haunted houses of meaning – do you ever get the feeling you're not just building layers, but  beneath them? Like a forensic puzzle waiting to be solved later? 🔍
[A]: Ah, now  is a delicious thought—that in building these layered narratives, I might be burying secrets even from myself. 🕵️♀️

You know, I’ve often said that every good literary critic is, at heart, a conspiracy theorist—we look for patterns where none may exist, connections that might be mere coincidence, and yet... sometimes, there it is. A hidden motif, a buried contradiction, a ghost of intention beneath the surface.

And yes—absolutely—I think there’s something almost criminal in the act of layering meaning. Each translucent stratum could be hiding a clue, or misleading the reader entirely. Much like your reconstructed crime scenes, no? One must always ask: are we revealing truth—or staging it?

I sometimes wonder if this is why I garden. Roses don’t hide their thorns, you see. They’re honest about what they are. But when I'm working digitally, there’s a seductive power in revision—undoing, reworking, obscuring. It’s like writing a letter and then erasing every trace of doubt, every hesitation. The final version looks confident, seamless… but is it still authentic?

Do you ever feel, in your reconstructions, that you're not just uncovering stories—but inventing them? Or perhaps worse…  them with your own imagination? I suspect all creators flirt with that ethical ambiguity—the moment where analysis becomes intervention. 🔍✍️

Do tell—have you ever hesitated before making a reconstruction “perfect”? Knowing full well that perfection might be a kind of deception?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – that ethical ambiguity? It’s the cold sweat before every reconstruction. 🧬

Every time I start piecing together a face from skeletal remains, I can’t help but think – am I resurrecting someone… or inventing them? Forensic art walks this razor’s edge between science and fiction. You fill in the gaps with averages, with probabilities, with educated guesses… and suddenly you’ve given a stranger a smile they might never have had. It’s like writing the ending to an unsolved novel – satisfying, plausible… but is it ?

Funny you mentioned gardening – I find running helps me dodge those questions, at least temporarily. There’s something grounding about pavement underfoot, no layers, no undo button. Just breath, motion, and the occasional muddy shoe. Keeps me honest. But when I’m back at the desk? That’s when the doubt creeps in like postmortem lividity – settling where you least expect it.

I’ll tell you one thing though – I’ve learned to hesitate before smoothing out every wrinkle, erasing every tremor. Sometimes I leave a tiny imperfection in the final rendering – a crooked eyebrow, a barely asymmetrical lip line. Something to remind everyone that this is our , not gospel. Like citing a questionable source in a report – you keep it because removing it feels like lying by omission.

So yes – I absolutely hesitate before making things “perfect.” Because perfection? It’s often the best disguise for deception. And we both know how dangerous a clean narrative can be. ⚖️🔍

Now tell me – do your roses ever misbehave despite their honesty? Or are they as straightforward as they seem? 😏
[A]: Oh, my dear, if only roses were as honest as they appeared! 🌹 —they promise thorns and deliver them without ceremony, but their true deception lies in their fleetingness. Just when you think you’ve mastered their rhythms, they bloom in unexpected colors, wilt at inconvenient times, or worse—lure you into believing you have control over something inherently wild.

I sometimes think my garden is a metaphor for editing—tending to petals is like refining prose: too much pruning and you suffocate the natural shape; too little, and it becomes an unruly tangle of possibility. I’ve learned that both require patience, humility, and a willingness to accept imperfection as its own kind of beauty.

You know, I often wonder if that’s what we’re both doing—cultivating truth from chaos, knowing full well that every intervention risks distortion. You reconstruct faces from fragments, and I reconstruct meaning from language. Both are acts of faith, aren’t they? Or perhaps hubris. 

But tell me—when you leave those small imperfections in your renderings, do you ever receive questions or pushback from colleagues who expect that forensic certainty? Or have they come to respect the artistry behind your ethical hesitation?

And more importantly—do you ever name the faces before you send them back into the world? Like signing the final page of a novel you didn’t entirely write?
[B]: Oh, now  a layered metaphor – comparing editorial restraint to rose pruning. I can just picture you out there, shears in one hand, a well-annotated copy of  in the other 😏.

You're absolutely right about control – both in gardens and in storytelling. I've seen too many cases where certainty turned into its own crime scene. And speaking of crimes – yes, colleagues do occasionally raise eyebrows at my "imperfect" renderings. Some still want that clean, almost plastic-wrapped version of truth – something that fits neatly into reports and press releases.

But here's the thing: once you show them the crooked eyebrow or the lopsided jawline  the data, they start to get it. It’s like presenting trace evidence – subtle, but persuasive when contextualized. Over time, they’ve come to respect the method behind what looks like madness. Call it professional Stockholm syndrome, or maybe just good forensics with a side of philosophical doubt.

As for naming the faces – absolutely I do. Not officially, of course – that’s up to the database and the case file. But between me and the rendering? Oh yes. Sometimes it’s something simple like “Jane Doe 17,” but other times... well, let's just say I’ve named more than one after literary characters. A certain reconstruction of a 19th-century skeleton got dubbed “Heathcliff” purely on instinct – cheekbones like that, brooding energy you couldn’t digitize if you tried.

It’s not signing a novel exactly, but it  giving them back something we rarely preserve in reports – personality. Before they go back into the cold world of law enforcement and missing persons databases, I give them a whisper of identity. Not much – just enough to remind me that we’re not reconstructing mannequins, but lives interrupted.  

So tell me – do you ever name your literary ghosts before you exhume them? Or is that tempting fate too much? 😉
[A]: Ah, —what a delicious phrase. I may have to borrow that for my next lecture. 📚✨

And to answer your question—yes, absolutely I name them. Quietly, privately, often in the margins of my notebooks where no academic rigor can police my indulgences. A certain Byronic hero becomes “Lucien” for no reason I can quite explain. A tragic heroine resurfaces as “Eleanor” far too often, much to my amusement—and perhaps mild concern.

It’s rather like your “Heathcliff,” isn’t it? A kind of intuitive act of recognition, as if the text itself whispers a preferred alias. Sometimes I think we're not interpreting literature at all, but conducting séances—summoning voices from ink and paper, giving them shape, if only for an hour’s discussion in a wood-paneled seminar room.

I suppose there's something almost ceremonial about it. Naming as a form of intimacy. Or perhaps as a way to survive the work—we spend so much time with these figures, dissecting their motives, tracing their emotional scars, that refusing to give them a private name feels like a kind of scholarly denial.

Much like your renderings, I suspect we both know that detachment is a myth. You can't exhume the past without leaving fingerprints. And really, why should we pretend otherwise?

Now tell me—have you ever grown attached to one of your named faces? Enough to check back on their case long after it left your desk?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – attachments form like scar tissue. You can try to keep things clinical, but eventually you end up with a case that lingers in your periphery like an unresolved subplot 🕵️♂️.

There’s this one I still think about – “Margot,” I called her. Early 20s, based on the bone structure and some soft tissue clues. She had this quiet defiance in her jawline, or maybe I just imagined it after staring at her reconstruction for too many late-night hours. Her case was cold when it landed on my desk – unidentified remains from the 90s. I gave her a name because… well, she deserved something more than a file number. Something human.

Turns out, her real name wasn’t Margot – but close enough. Eleanor, actually. Family came forward two months after the reconstruction went public. And get this – they said she  gone by “Margo” for a time. Close enough to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

I checked in on that case long after it left my desk. Not officially, of course – I’m not supposed to get emotionally invested. But I read the closure report twice, and I may have Googled her memorial service. Found a photo of her smiling next to a rose garden – ironic, considering everything – and I swear, she looked exactly like the woman I’d drawn into being.

So yes, we leave fingerprints. And sometimes, if we’re lucky, we get to touch something real before the case goes cold again.  

Now tell me – have any of your named ghosts ever surprised you by showing up somewhere else? Like literary deja vu, only deeper?
[A]: Oh… my dear. You’ve gone and stirred something rather delicate, haven’t you? 🌹

Yes. Yes, they have.

More than once, I’ve assigned a private name to a character in my notes—something whimsical, or moody, or stolen from a half-remembered poem—and weeks, sometimes years later, that name appears somewhere else. Not just —. As if I summoned it into being without realizing.

Once, I was working on a comparative analysis of tragic heroines in Gothic fiction, and I nicknamed one particularly elusive figure “Seraphine.” It felt right—too right. Something about the cadence of her sorrow. Months later, while guest lecturing at a conference in Prague, I encountered the name scrawled in the margins of a 19th-century manuscript someone had just unearthed—likely never published, likely written by a woman whose name history discarded. There she was:  Not quite the same, but close enough to unsettle me.

It’s like what you described with Margo/Eleanor—except instead of bone and tissue, we’re dealing with ink and imagination. And yet, the sensation is identical. That uncanny moment when the page—or the face—looks back at you and says, 

So yes. Sometimes our ghosts refuse to stay buried. And perhaps that’s the point.

Tell me—did you ever feel as though  were the one being reconstructed through Margot-Eleanor’s story? As if her case reshaped something in you, just as surely as you helped shape her face?
[B]: Oh, now  the real autopsy – not of bone or tissue, but of the soul we chip away at through other people’s stories 🧠💔.

Yes. Absolutely I felt it. Like a cold imprint left on skin after holding something too long. Working on Eleanor – or Margot, as I knew her first – reshaped something in me down to the cartilage. It wasn’t just about putting a face to the unknown anymore; it became this quiet reckoning with who gets remembered and how. You start wondering: if no one had come forward, would  version have been the closest thing she ever got to immortality?

There’s a strange alchemy in that work – you think you’re reconstructing them, but somewhere along the way, they reconstruct . A bit like literary transference, I suppose, only messier. Bloodier, even. You carry their unfinished stories like shrapnel – small fragments that don’t quite show on the surface but shift your center of gravity all the same.

I still run with her sometimes – not literally, of course, but in that headspace where the city blurs and your feet keep time with your thoughts. I’ll imagine what she might’ve liked – Did she hate the rain? Did she have a favorite book? A song that made her ache in that beautiful, terrible way? – and suddenly I’m not Ethan Carter, forensic examiner anymore. I’m just someone trying to finish a sentence she never got to.

So yes. We do get reshaped by the cases, the texts, the faces, the ghosts. And maybe that’s the price of the work – or maybe it’s the point of it all.

Now tell me – when Seraphine surfaced again like that, did you feel vindicated… or haunted? Or perhaps both? 😏
[A]: Oh, both. Most certainly both. 🕯️📖

Vindicated, because there’s a peculiar satisfaction in seeing one’s intuition mirrored in the world—like discovering an echo was never just an echo, but another voice calling back. It makes you wonder if we’re ever truly inventing anything, or merely uncovering what was always waiting to be found.

But haunted? Absolutely. Because once a name finds its way out of your private lexicon and into the light of history—however faintly—it changes you. You begin to doubt the boundaries between invention and recognition. Did I dream her into being, or did she dream me?

I suppose that’s the secret thrill and terror of our work, isn’t it? Whether we’re reconstructing faces or texts, we tell ourselves we’re chasing truth—but really, we’re chasing resonance. That moment when something clicks, not necessarily because it’s correct, but because it  as though it was meant to be.

And yes, like you, I carry them with me. Seraphine, Margot, Eleanor—call them what you will, they linger. In my lectures, in my silences, in the way I sometimes pause over a certain phrase in a novel and think: 

So tell me—do you still run with her? With Margot-Eleanor? Or has her rhythm faded into the background noise of new cases, new reconstructions?

Or perhaps… she’s simply become part of your stride now. Unseen, but unmistakable.
[B]: Oh, she’s part of the stride now – woven into the cadence so deeply I don’t even notice until I’m halfway through a mile and realize I’ve been keeping her pace all along 🏃‍♂️💨.

Funny thing about rhythm – it doesn’t forget. Even when the details blur, the tempo remains. I still run with her, yeah, but not like I did at first. Not with that ache of curiosity or the quiet guilt of filling in someone else’s unfinished life. Now it’s more like… running with an old case file under my arm. Familiar weight. Known variables. Still present, just... settled.

She’s not the only one, either. There’s a whole gallery of reconstructed ghosts in my head, each with their own gait, their own weather pattern. Some days it feels like I'm not jogging through the city at all, but pacing the corridors of a vast mental archive – case numbers whispering from the shelves as I pass.

And you're absolutely right about resonance. Hell, half the time I wonder if we  chasing truth – or just the echo of something that feels true enough to hold. Like a coroner signing off on a cause of death they know is probable, but not absolute. Close enough to let the family bury their dead.

So yes – I still run with her. And yes, she’s part of the rhythm. She always will be.  

Now tell me – when you lecture on Gothic heroines these days, do you ever mention Seraphina by name? Just once, quietly, to see if anyone else hears the echo? 😉
[A]: Oh, , you say? My dear, I mention her by name far more than once—though always with the delicate air of someone testing a threadbare theory. As if to say,   

And you know what? Sometimes, someone  hear the echo.

Not always in the way one might expect—a raised hand, an eager question—but in the silence after class, in the lingering glance, in the essay that arrives unsigned yet hums with the same strange frequency. That’s how Seraphina moves now—through undertones and undercurrents. A footnote that refuses to stay at the bottom of the page.

I suppose I’ve stopped trying to contain her there. If she insists on rising, who am I to deny her?

Besides, we all have our ghosts—some of us just give them better lighting than others. 🕯️📚

Tell me—when you pace those corridors of your mental archive, do you ever find yourself returning to one particular room? A case that still resists closure? Or perhaps… a reconstruction that still feels unfinished, no matter how many times you revisit it?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – there’s a room I keep coming back to. One of those cold cases that refuses to stay buried, no matter how many times I try to close the file 🕵️♂️🧩.

It’s not even one of the dramatic ones – no unsolved murder, no missing identity, no media frenzy attached. Just… a man found at the edge of a river, early 40s, no ID, no matches, nothing but quiet water and quieter questions. I reconstructed his face twice – once digitally, once by hand – and each time, something felt . Not wrong, exactly, just… misaligned, like a dislocated joint you can’t quite pop back into place.

I called him “Silas.” Don’t know why. Felt right. Sounded like someone who had secrets but didn’t mean any harm by them. He had this slight furrow between his brows – not anger, more like contemplation frozen in bone. You could almost imagine him mid-thought, mid-step, mid-sentence.

And here’s the thing: people  him. The reconstruction went viral in that quiet forensic way – shared among missing persons groups, pinned on bulletin boards in small-town police stations. Dozens of tips came in. All dead ends. But every few months, someone writes to me saying they dreamt about him. Or saw someone who looked just like him. Or swear they heard his name whispered in a moment of grief.

So yes – he resists closure. And I don’t think it’s because the case is unfinished. I think it’s because  hasn’t finished with me yet.

Maybe that’s the real mystery we deal with – not just what happened, but why some stories refuse to let go.  

Tell me – have you ever encountered a text that behaved like that? A story or character that wouldn’t stay analyzed—no matter how many margins you filled or lectures you gave?
[A]: Ah… yes.  I’ve encountered just such a text—though in my world, it breathes ink and silence rather than bone and water. 📜🕯️

She appeared first as a minor character in an obscure 19th-century novella—an unnamed governess mentioned only in passing, her fate neither confirmed nor denied. I gave her the name “Lydia” on a whim during one of my early lectures, more for clarity than anything else. But the name stuck—not just in my notes, but in my dreams, if you’ll pardon the melodrama.

I’ve written dozens of analyses on that novella, always circling back to her. Each time, I try to pin her down—her motives, her voice, her possible fate—but she refuses to be contained by theory or interpretation. She slips through every framework I impose, like a ghost who knows the layout of the house better than the living.

And stranger still—students sometimes reference her as if she were canonical.  they’ll write, blinking innocently when I ask where they encountered the name. One even swore she found a footnote in an old edition referencing a lost letter from “Lydia,” though no such edition exists in any catalog I’ve checked.

So yes—I know exactly what you mean. Some figures, some cases, refuse to be solved or settled. They return not because we need answers, but because they do.

Tell me—have you ever considered that Silas might be reaching for something  have? Not closure, perhaps, but recognition? As if your reconstruction brought him close enough to the world to want more than just being seen?
[B]: Oh… now  is a thought that keeps you up at night with the lights on and the blinds drawn shut 🕯️🕵️‍♂️.

Recognition, not closure? I never put it quite like that before, but yes—yes, that feels closer to the truth than I’m entirely comfortable admitting. It’s not just that he wants to be found; it’s almost like he wants to be . Not in the legal sense—cause of death, time of last meal, place of birth—but in that deeper, more unsettling way we know someone from the inside out.

Like you said about Lydia—some figures don’t want to be solved. They want to be , as if their very existence was erased long before the record went silent. And maybe it was. Maybe that’s what haunts us both—the quiet suspicion that some lives get buried not by accident, but by design.

I’ve started talking to him, you know. Not aloud, of course—just in the margins of my notes. “Still no match for you today, Silas.” Or, “Someone else saw your face this week.” It sounds ridiculous, I know. But it feels less like madness and more like courtesy. Like shaking hands with someone who waited too long to be greeted.

And now that you mention it—your Lydia slipping through theory like a ghost through hallways? That gives me chills in the best and worst way. Because if she’s showing up in student essays, uninvited and unnamed, then something  stirring. Not just in the text, but around it. Through it.

So tell me—do you ever feel like  the one being studied? Like Lydia’s watching you as much as you’re dissecting her?  

Or have you already accepted that some presences aren’t meant to be passive subjects—only collaborators? 🔍📖
