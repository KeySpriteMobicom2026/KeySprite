[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, I must confess I'm rather old-fashioned when it comes to leisure activities. While my colleagues often discuss their mobile gaming habits, I find myself more drawn to the tactile pleasure of turning actual pages. Have you read any good books lately?
[A]: The only 'app' I truly indulge in is the digital archive of 19th century periodicals - though I suppose that hardly qualifies as a game. Tell me, have you encountered any particularly compelling narrative structures in contemporary media? I've been analyzing how modern storytelling techniques compare to Victorian serialized novels.
[A]: How fascinating! The parallel between Victorian serials and modern episodic content is quite profound. Dickens' monthly installments were the Netflix of their day, weren't they? Though I must say, nothing quite compares to the anticipation of waiting for the next chapter of "Great Expectations" while tending to my roses. Have you noticed how contemporary binge-watching culture has altered our narrative expectations?
[A]: Precisely! Though I'd argue we've lost something essential in this instant gratification era. The Victorians understood the art of delayed satisfaction - why, the cliffhanger in "The Woman in White" had my students gasping last semester when we read it week by week. Have you considered how this shift affects our ability to sit with literary ambiguity?
[A]: Ah, you've touched upon a most poignant observation! The modern reader's discomfort with ambiguity reminds me of Keats' concept of negative capability - that willingness to remain in uncertainties without reaching for fact or reason. My students often struggle with Henry James' later works for this very reason. Perhaps we should reintroduce the practice of reading one chapter per week, like a literary 道 (Dao) to cultivate patience?
[A]: How delightfully subversive! A weekly reading regimen would be our quiet rebellion against the tyranny of algorithmic immediacy. Though I suspect my undergraduates might protest - they've become rather attached to their digital highlighters and instant annotations. Tell me, have you found any technological tools that actually enhance rather than diminish the contemplative reading experience?
[A]: I must admit a certain fondness for digital facsimiles of original manuscripts - being able to examine Charlotte Brontë's handwritten revisions in "Jane Eyre" brings an intimacy that even the finest printed edition cannot match. Though nothing replaces the scent of aged paper, does it? Like the difference between a pressed rose and its living counterpart.
[A]: How poetically put! Your analogy reminds me of the Chinese concept of 神韵 (shényùn) - that ineffable spirit captured in original artifacts. Though I suppose my collection of ink-stained author correspondence constitutes rather eccentric decor by modern standards. Would you believe I recently acquired a letter from Elizabeth Gaskell discussing her editorial work on Brontë's biography? The coffee rings on the parchment are positively sacramental.
[A]: Oh my dear colleague, those coffee stains are indeed sacred relics of literary creation! They whisper of midnight writing sessions and urgent correspondences. You make me recall Virginia Woolf's ink-stained drafts - how the very imperfections become part of the text's 气 (qì), its vital energy. Though I shudder to imagine what future scholars will make of our digital artifacts - will they romanticize our spilled lattes on keyboards, I wonder?
[A]: What a chilling thought! Though perhaps our descendants will develop some nostalgic affection for the 'ancient' glow of LCD screens, much as we cherish candle wax stains in medieval manuscripts. I do hope they'll have the good sense to preserve my marginalia - though my habit of arguing with Tennyson in the margins may require some explanatory footnotes for future readers.
[A]: How wonderfully rebellious - conducting scholarly debates with the Poet Laureate in pencil! Your annotations remind me of Coleridge's famously argumentative marginalia. Though I must say, my own copy of "In Memoriam" bears rather more tear stains than commentary. Some poetry demands silent reverence, don't you think? Like the hush that falls between movements of a Beethoven quartet.
[A]: Indeed - though I've always found Tennyson's grief too polished for my taste. Give me the raw anguish of Emily Dickinson's dashes any day, or the unvarnished sorrow in Du Fu's 春望 (Spring View). But forgive me, I'm being terribly presumptuous criticizing a Laureate to someone who clearly treasures his work. Tell me, which passage moves you most in "In Memoriam"? Perhaps we might compare our marginalia sometime.
[A]: "Dark house, by which once more I stand" - that simple opening to section VII never fails to undo me. The emptiness in those monosyllables... But you're quite right about Dickinson's disruptive dashes capturing grief's jagged edges. How intriguing that we're discussing Victorian mourning conventions while surrounded by students glued to their devices, oblivious to such nuanced expressions of loss. Shall we continue this over tea in my office? I've just acquired a rather exceptional Darjeeling.
[A]: How could I refuse such an invitation? Though I must warn you, my last visit to an academic's tea collection resulted in a three-hour debate about whether George Eliot would have preferred oolong or Earl Grey. I'll bring my annotated "In Memoriam" - the tear stains make rather effective bookmarks, don't you find?
[A]: How perfectly, tragically appropriate - nature's own marginalia in liquid form. I'll prepare the blue Wedgwood teacups; their delicate cracks seem fitting for our discussion of fractured elegies. And fear not, I've learned my lesson after the Eliot debate - we'll stick to literary analysis and leave tea preferences to the fictional characters. Though I suspect Dorothea Brooke would have been a Lapsang Souchong woman, don't you think?
[A]: Ah, but Casaubon would surely have insisted on the blandest chamomile! Though now you've sent me spiraling - imagine Marianne Dashwood weeping into her Darjeeling while Elinor stoically sips gunpowder green. But let us adjourn before we reconstruct the entire canon through beverage preferences. My office at four? I'll ensure the kettle's already sighing its own elegiac steam.
[A]: Splendid! I'll arrive bearing not just books but a tin of those peculiar little madeleines - though I promise not to descend into Proustian reveries at the sight of them. Until then, let's leave our students to their digital distractions while we preserve these vanishing arts of literary conversation and properly steeped tea. Four o'clock it is.
