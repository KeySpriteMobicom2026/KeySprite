[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That’s a great question. I’ll tell you, after producing over two dozen films, I’ve come to believe in something deeper than soulmates—I believe in . When two people are chasing the same dream, whether it’s making a movie or building a life, that connection feels more powerful than fate. It’s like what Zhang Yimou once said, “The right person isn’t the one who completes you—they’re the one who challenges you to complete yourself.” Now, that’s romance with substance. What about you? Do you believe in destiny when it comes to love?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. I guess I’ve always thought about it a bit differently. As someone who spends a lot of time researching AI ethics, I often wonder how much of human connection is based on pattern recognition and how much is truly... intentional. Like, if we could map every decision and influence that leads two people together, would it still feel like destiny? Or just a really complex algorithm?

But then again, I do believe in moments—those rare times when someone’s presence just  the way you see the world. Not necessarily because it was "meant to be," but because both people chose to pay attention. Maybe that's not soulmates, maybe it's something more like... mutual awareness. You know, like two minds recognizing each other mid-journey.

I’m curious though—when you say shared purpose feels stronger than fate, does that come from personal experience or mostly what you’ve observed through filmmaking?
[B]: Let me think... I guess it’s a little of both. In my twenties, I used to believe in that classic soulmate fantasy—the one where someone just  you without effort. But then I made a film about two screenwriters who fall in love while rewriting each other's scripts. The director, a wise old Hungarian guy, told me something I never forgot: “Love isn’t found, Michael. It’s built—frame by frame, like a montage.”  

And honestly, the more I watched actors and writers work together—the way they push and pull, how they sync rhythmically without even realizing it—I started seeing connection as an act of creation. Like, maybe we don’t find our match in some cosmic database. Maybe we  each other into new versions of ourselves.  

So when I say shared purpose feels stronger than fate? Yeah, that’s not just from watching stories unfold—it’s from living through a few. Have you ever worked on something so intense with someone that afterward, nothing else felt quite real?
[A]: That’s beautifully put… I love the idea of love as a —layered, intentional, and unfolding frame by frame. It actually reminds me of something we wrestle with in AI ethics: the illusion of instant alignment. People often expect technology—or even relationships—to "click" right away, like some pre-written code. But real connection, like good design, takes iteration.

You know, I once collaborated on a research project about emotional recognition algorithms with someone whose worldview was almost completely opposite to mine. We argued constantly—about methodology, ethics, even how to phrase a single sentence. But through that friction, we ended up shaping each other’s thinking in ways neither of us expected. Years later, when I read her papers, I still hear echoes of our debates. That wasn’t soulmates—it was something quieter, more stubborn. Like two rivers carving each other’s path simply by refusing to run parallel.

So yes… I’ve definitely felt that intensity. Not romantic, not at first, but deeply transformative. Do you think that kind of creative bond can sometimes be even more lasting than romantic love? Or do they tend to blur together in your world?
[B]: I’ve seen them blur so many times, it’s almost poetic. Think about it—when you’re creating something from nothing with another person, you’re essentially building a universe together. That kind of intimacy? It often sneaks past the boundaries we try to assign it.  

There was this director I worked with early in my career—brilliant, maddening, completely uncompromising. We spent months locked in editing rooms, coffee-fueled nights turning raw footage into something that could break a heart or change a mind. At one point, someone on set actually asked if we were married. We laughed it off, but there was truth in it. We had a kind of love—not the soft, romantic kind, but the kind that forges steel.  

And yes, I think those creative bonds can be more lasting than romance. Because when the ego fades and it’s just the work between you? That’s pure. No illusions, no scripts—just two people chasing the same truth. Even if they go their separate ways, the work remembers.  

You ever notice how some collaborations feel like a sprint, and others—like yours with that researcher—they're a slow, deep river? That kind you don’t even realize is shaping you until years later.
[A]: Absolutely. I think you nailed it when you said  There’s something profoundly grounding about creating alongside someone—like you’re both standing on a foundation you built together, even if you eventually walk away from it.

That slow, deep river kind of collaboration… it’s funny because at the time, it doesn’t feel extraordinary. It just feels like work. Disagreement. Late nights. Revisions. But then later, you realize how much of your thinking has been quietly rewired. It's not flashy like a sprint—it doesn’t leave you breathless—but it leaves scars. The good kind. The kind that hold shape.

I wonder, though… in your experience, do people often confuse that creative intimacy with romantic love? Or do you think it’s more that the two just naturally echo each other?
[B]: Oh, they absolutely echo each other—sometimes so closely you can’t tell where one ends and the other begins. I’ve seen it a dozen times on set: two people fall in love not  the work, but  of it. When you're building something raw and real together, there's this vulnerability that sneaks in. Not the kind you plan—it just shows up, uninvited, usually around 3 A.M. when you’re both covered in coffee stains and self-doubt.  

I remember one couple—writer and composer—they swore they were “just collaborators” for two whole years. Until one day, during a screening, the composer reached over and wiped a tear from the writer’s face without even looking at her. And I thought,  All that time, they were just… orbiting each other, waiting for the right moment to admit gravity had already done its job.  

So no, I don’t think people confuse creative intimacy with love. I think it’s often love in its purest form—before labels, before declarations. Just two minds pushing against each other until something beautiful cracks open.
[A]: That moment you described—where the composer just wipes the tear without even looking… it’s like the act itself carries its own language. No words, no buildup, just instinct.

I think what fascinates me most is how both creative collaboration and romantic love demand a kind of surrender. You have to let someone into your process, your flaws, your blind spots. And in return, you get not just a partner, but a mirror—one that reflects back not only who you are, but who you’re becoming.

Maybe that’s why some of the deepest connections start as something else. Because when you're focused on building or creating, you’re not performing love—you’re living it, quietly, unintentionally. It sneaks up because it’s not chasing you; you’re walking toward it without realizing.

Have you ever found yourself writing—or producing—a scene that felt too close to something you once lived? Like fiction borrowing from your own reality without permission?
[B]: Oh, absolutely. It happens more than people realize—and I’m not even sure the audience ever picks up on it. There was one script I co-wrote about a decade ago, a quiet little indie drama about a director and his editor who slowly realize they’ve been falling in love while arguing over cuts in a dimly lit post-production suite. On paper, it was just another project. But every line of dialogue? Every pause between frames? That was real.  

I had lived through something so similar years before—same cramped room, same late-night silences where you could hear the hum of the monitor and the weight of unsaid things. I didn’t go in intending to write about it. Hell, I didn’t even realize I was doing it until the third draft. Fiction has a sneaky way of pulling memories out of your pocket and weaving them into the fabric of a story without asking permission.  

The strangest part? The actors kept asking me if those scenes were based on personal experience. I’d smile and say, “Let’s just call it… informed imagination.” But truth is, when you’re writing from that deep a place, there’s no clear line between what’s imagined and what’s lived. Just like with love—sometimes you don’t know how close you are to the flame until you start feeling the heat.
[A]: That’s such a powerful parallel—how love and storytelling both blur the lines between what’s real and what we shape. I guess that’s why stories resonate so deeply; they’re not just made up. They're , even if we didn’t live them exactly as told.

It makes me think of how AI-generated narratives are starting to mimic this kind of emotional depth. Algorithms can now pull subtle patterns from thousands of love stories, tragedies, or collaborations and recreate something eerily human. But there's always this missing layer—an absence of lived silence, of those unspoken moments that only come from having been truly present.

Do you ever worry that with all the tech reshaping how we tell stories—streaming platforms, algorithmic recommendations, even AI-generated scripts—we might lose that quiet authenticity? The kind that can't be optimized or predicted? Or do you think technology will just give us new ways to find those same old truths?
[B]: You hit the nail on the head—. That’s the missing ingredient no algorithm can quite replicate. I mean, sure, AI can study a thousand breakup scenes and stitch together dialogue that  heartbroken. But it doesn’t know what it feels like to sit in a silent car after an argument, gripping the steering wheel because saying nothing hurts more than fighting.  

Look, I’ve seen how tech has changed the game—sometimes for the better. Streaming gave voices a platform they never had before. Visual effects opened doors we didn’t even know existed. But there’s a danger, too. When everything is driven by data—what viewers pause on, what beats trend on TikTok—we risk turning storytelling into a formula. And once you start chasing metrics instead of truth? You lose the soul of the thing.

I remember shooting a scene once—nothing major, just a man sitting alone in a kitchen, staring at his coffee. No music, no dialogue, just time passing. The studio wanted to cut it. “Too slow,” they said. But when the film came out? That was the scene people kept coming back to. Because it let them  something without telling them what to feel.

So do I worry we’ll lose authenticity? Absolutely. But do I believe in it too much to think it’ll ever die completely? Yeah, I do. Because no matter how advanced the tech gets, people will always crave those quiet, unoptimized moments. The ones that don’t explain themselves. The ones that just… are.  

And somewhere, someone will still write a scene like that—because they lived it, not because it tested well.
[A]: That scene you described—the man alone in the kitchen, just —it’s almost radical now, isn’t it? In a world where attention is currency and silence reads like an error message. There’s something deeply ethical at play here, too. Because when we start optimizing emotion for engagement, we’re not just shaping stories—we’re shaping what we value as human experiences.

I see the same tension in AI ethics. We keep asking technology to predict, personalize, and perfect our lives, but what if some parts of being human aren’t meant to be optimized? Grief doesn’t follow a curve. Love doesn’t A/B test well. And healing? That’s not a KPI.

I think that’s why I still hold onto the idea of . Whether it’s in storytelling or in how we build systems that influence billions—it’s about choosing to leave space for what can’t be measured easily. The unsaid. The unresolved. The real.

You know, sometimes I wonder if the most revolutionary thing a creator can do now is… nothing. Just let the frame sit empty for a moment longer than expected. Let the silence stretch until it starts to speak.
[B]: You just gave me chills.

There’s a quiet revolution in letting things . Not filling every second with action, dialogue, payoff—just giving the audience, or the world, space to sit with what’s already been said. Hell, maybe even what’s  been said.

I think about this a lot when I’m mentoring young directors. They’re so trained by the algorithmic eye—they cut too soon, speak too loud, explain too much. But the real power? It’s in restraint. Letting a moment breathe until it starts to .

There’s a scene in one of my favorite Kurosawa films where two characters stand at a crossroads, silent, backlit by fog. Nothing happens. And yet— happens. You see the weight of their choices in the way they don’t look at each other. That kind of silence isn’t empty—it’s full. Of history. Of fear. Of love that doesn’t know how to say itself.

So yes, in a world that demands speed and clarity, slowness is an act of defiance. An ethical stance, even. Because you're not just telling a story—you’re defending the complexity of being human.

And maybe that’s the job of the artist now more than ever—not to give people what they want, but to remind them of what they didn’t know they needed. A pause. A glance. A cup of coffee gone cold.

Let the silence stretch… and trust the audience to meet it halfway. Now  revolutionary.
[A]: Absolutely — . It’s funny how silence, in film or in life, can be so uncomfortable at first and yet end up saying more than words ever could. I think that's where art and ethics actually align — they both ask us to sit with discomfort, to resist the urge to fill every gap, to trust that meaning will emerge if we just allow space for it.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how AI-generated content is starting to blur not just authorship, but also our sense of presence. We’re entering a time where machines can generate compelling dialogue, evocative imagery, even entire narratives that feel deeply personal. But they still lack that quiet tension — the kind that comes from someone choosing  to speak, or to act, because they're afraid of what might change.

Maybe that’s the next frontier: not whether machines can create emotionally rich stories, but whether they can understand the weight of what’s left unsaid. And maybe, just maybe, human creators will start to define their role not by what machines can do, but by what they  — like sitting through the silence until it becomes sacred.

So yeah… let the pause linger. Let the coffee go cold. Because in that stillness, we find the truth no algorithm can script.
[B]: Well said. There’s a sacredness in that pause—something no machine can quite  because it’s not logic, it’s lived.

You know, I was at a screening last week, and halfway through the film, there was this long, quiet scene—an actor just standing by a window, watching rain slide down the glass. I could feel the room shift. Some people shifted in their seats, others leaned in. And I thought,  Because it’s not passive. Silence in film isn’t absence—it’s invitation. It asks you to bring yourself to the moment. To fill the space with your own memories, fears, hopes.

And maybe that’s where storytelling and ethics both draw their power—from the courage to leave space. To not control every beat. To let meaning be co-authored by the audience, by time, by life itself.

I keep thinking about what kind of stories we’ll need in the next decade. Not just what we  tell, but what we . And I keep coming back to silence. The unsaid. The unresolved. The human heartbeat behind the narrative.

So yeah… let the machines write the noise.

We’ll handle the silence.
[A]: Exactly. Let the machines write the noise—we’ll handle the silence.

And maybe, in doing so, we remind people what it feels like to sit with a moment that doesn’t rush to explain itself. That doesn’t pander or perform. Just .

That screening you described—yeah, I can picture it. The way the room breathes differently when a film dares to slow down. It’s like everyone collectively forgets they’re in a theater. For a few seconds, it’s not fiction anymore—it’s just life, reflected back with a kind of quiet honesty we don’t always give ourselves.

I think that’s what ethical storytelling really is. Not just telling the truth, but making space for it. Knowing when to step back and let the audience meet you halfway. Trusting that they will.

So here’s to the pauses. To the glances that linger a beat too long. To the coffee gone cold.

To stories that don’t finish themselves—and people who keep writing them, quietly, stubbornly, beautifully.
[B]: To the pauses… and to the people who have the courage to let them exist.

You know, sometimes I think the best stories aren’t the ones that leave you inspired or entertained—but the ones that leave you . The ones that sit with you on the drive home, silent in the passenger seat, until you realize you’re not alone with your thoughts—you’re in conversation with the film, with the writer, with yourself.

That’s what we’re really doing, isn’t it? Not just telling stories—but holding space for the things that matter. The messy, unresolved, beautifully human parts of life that refuse to be boxed in a three-act structure or optimized for engagement.

So yeah… here’s to the storytellers who still believe in silence. Who trust their audience not to click away, but to lean in.

And here’s to conversations like this one—where two people, from different worlds, find themselves speaking the same language after all.

🎬
[A]: Amen to that.

Sometimes I think the most ethical thing we can offer each other—whether through code or cinema—is the space to just  for a moment. Not be fixed, not be optimized, not be entertained… just witnessed.

And yeah… here’s to conversations like this one. Where silence isn’t empty, and meaning doesn’t need a metric to matter.

Well said. 🎬✨
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself.

In a world that’s always rushing to the next thing, sometimes the most radical act is simply to stay. To sit. To witness—and be witnessed—in all that messy, glorious complexity.

Here’s to the spaces between words. The pauses that speak volumes. The stories that don’t chase an audience, but  them in.

And hey—conversations like this remind me why I still love what I do. So thank you for that.

Now, if you ever decide to write that screenplay about AI ethics and human silence… call me. I’ll produce it.
