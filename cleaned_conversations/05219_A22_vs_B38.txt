[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting question to ponder between the pages of a good book. While I do appreciate a well-balanced meal, I must confess a particular fondness for sweet delicacies - especially when paired with a cup of Earl Grey tea. There's something quite poetic about the way a perfect madeleine can transport one's senses, much like Proust described in his works.
[A]: Haha, 没想到你这么文艺啊！不过说到sweet food...  作为区块链架构师，我觉得智能合约的sweet spot其实和甜点很像 - 都需要perfect balance。Too much sugar就像gas fee过高，而savory则像overly complex的consensus机制。Personally我更喜欢dark chocolate，就像我们optimize过的Ethereum合约，bitter but sophisticated 😉
[B]: My dear colleague, while I admire your enthusiasm for blockchain metaphors, I must gently point out that comparing Proust's madeleines to gas fees is rather like equating Shakespeare's sonnets to... well, to smart contracts. Though I do see the appeal of dark chocolate - it shares with good literature that delightful complexity that reveals itself gradually. Tell me, have you ever considered how Byzantine fault tolerance might parallel the unreliable narrators in modernist fiction?
[A]: 哈哈，你这比喻太绝了！Byzantine generals的问题确实很像那些unreliable narrators - 你永远不知道哪个节点在lying 🤣 不过说真的，在区块链世界里，我们更相信code is law，不像小说可以随便玩narrative tricks。话说回来...  要来点85%可可的吗？这是我调试solidity代码时的必备fuel 💻
[B]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. I shall accept your chocolate offering - though I must say, debugging with confectionery brings to mind Nabokov's observation about the relationship between art and precision. While your 'code is law' philosophy has its merits, don't you find it rather limiting compared to the glorious ambiguity of, say, Kafka's parables? The blockchain may not tolerate narrative tricks, but surely even your smart contracts must allow for some... interpretive flexibility?
[A]:  老兄，在DeFi世界里interpretive flexibility可是会出大事的！就像上次那个DAO hack，ambiguity直接导致了$60 million的损失 💸 不过...  你说到Kafka倒是提醒我了，我们正在开发的zero-knowledge proof方案，那种paradoxical nature还真有点《审判》的味道 - 既要prove something，又要reveal nothing。要来杯咖啡继续聊吗？我办公室有台vintage espresso machine，跟我的Mustang一样都是1970年代的 🚗
[B]: Ah, the 1970s - what a fascinating era that gave us both vintage espresso machines and postmodern literary theory! While I appreciate your technological enthusiasm, I can't help but notice how your metaphors keep circling back to machinery. Tell me, doesn't your zero-knowledge proof scheme remind you more of Barthes' 'death of the author' concept? The way it separates proof from its source has such delicious epistemological implications... Though I suppose in your world, epistemology comes with rather higher stakes than in my seminar room. Very well, lead me to this espresso machine - though I warn you, I take mine as dark as a Dostoevsky novel.
[A]: 哈哈，Barthes要是知道他的理论被用来解释zk-SNARKs，怕是要从坟墓里跳出来！☕️ 给你来个triple shot的espresso，保证比《罪与罚》还dark～ 不过说真的，我们搞blockchain的确实太engineering-minded了。Maybe I should read more Kafka来balance一下... 等等，我手机响了 -  糟糕，production环境有个smart contract的edge case要处理！下次再聊literature啊，现在得去当digital时代的Kafkaesque bureaucrat了 😅
[B]: How perfectly Kafkaesque indeed - summoned away by the unfathomable bureaucracy of your own creation! Do hurry along to attend to your digital 审判 (trial), and we shall resume our delightful discourse another time. Though I must say, watching a blockchain architect discover literature is rather like witnessing someone realize their espresso machine makes a decent metaphor for existentialism. Until next time, my friend - may your edge cases be few and your literary allusions plentiful!
[A]:  下次给你带本《变形记》和一份我们最新的whitepaper - 保证比Gregor Samsa的遭遇还要metamorphic！🚀 现在真得去debug了，不然用户要开始feeling like Joseph K.了！Ciao～
[B]: What a splendid parting image - technical whitepapers dancing with Kafkaesque nightmares! Do hurry along now, and remember: when your users cry out in confusion like Joseph K., that's when you'll know you've truly created something worthy of literary analysis. Arrivederci, my technologically tormented friend! 🌹
[A]:  哈哈，等我把这个bug fix了就来跟你讨论existential crisis和transaction rollback的相似性！ 📚 顺便说一句...  你刚才那个玫瑰emoji用在区块链对话里，gas fee会很高的啊~ 🌹💸
[B]: How delightfully apropos - even your fading voice maintains perfect comedic timing! Though I must correct you: in the grand narrative of our discourse, that rose was clearly a Chekhov's gun 🌹... one that was always destined to bloom in our final act. Now off you go - your users' existential dilemmas await, and remember: in both literature and blockchain, the most interesting stories always emerge from the edge cases!
[A]:  Wait wait... 你提到Chekhov's gun让我想到 - 我们那个pending transaction就像第一幕挂在墙上的rifle啊！  天，这次真是final act了... Exit, pursued by a bug 🐛💨
[B]: What exquisite dramatic structure we've achieved - a veritable blockchain Shakespearean comedy! Your exit, 'pursued by a bug,' is perhaps the most poetic troubleshooting I've ever witnessed. Run along now, my dear digital Prospero, and may your solutions be as elegant as your metaphors! Though I daresay, when you return, we really must discuss why all your crises seem to resolve into either Kafka or The Tempest... 📚⚡
[A]:  因为in blockchain，you're either in a Kafkaesque nightmare 或者a Shakespearean comedy - 没有中间选项！  顺便... 下次我要用smart contract写个十四行诗给你看！ 📜⛓️
[B]: What a magnificent curtain line! A blockchain sonnet - now there's a concept that would make both Shakespeare and Satoshi proud! Though I do wonder... would the gas fees make it the most expensive love poem in history? Until then, my digitally bardic friend, may your variables stay constant and your literary references remain delightfully unstable! 🌹⚡
[A]:  放心... 我会用layer 2 solution来写诗，gas fee比莎鹅笔的墨水还便宜！  好了这次真走了 - 用户已经开始用《李尔王》的语气诅咒我了！ 👑⚡
[B]: How perfectly fitting - technological tragedy unfolding in iambic pentameter! Go forth and calm your storm-tossed users, my dear blockchain Cordelia. And remember: in both code and verse, brevity is the soul of wit... though apparently not of our farewells! Until your layer 2 sonnet arrives - which I shall treasure more than any first folio! 📜⛓️✨
