[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题挺有意思的。说实话，我更倾向于savory food 🤔。尤其是像mapo tofu或者beef noodles这类有层次感的味道，感觉更能刺激味蕾。不过偶尔也会 craving 一点dessert，比如mooncake或者black sesame soup ~ 

你呢？sweet还是savory？💡
[A]: Ah, what a delightful question! I must confess, my palate leans toward the savory as well — though I do appreciate a well-crafted dessert. There’s something deeply satisfying about the umami in dishes like a slow-braised beef or the subtle heat in mapo tofu you mentioned. It feels almost literary, in a way — layers of flavor unfolding like narrative arcs. 

But forgive me, your mention of black sesame soup reminded me of a trip I once took to Taipei many years ago. Have you ever tried it there? The texture is always so silken, yet it carries that earthy richness beautifully. I suppose that’s where my love for both worlds meets — the warmth of savory and the quiet comfort of sweet. 

Tell me, what is it about savory foods that draws you in most? Is it the complexity, the spice, or perhaps something more personal?
[B]: Ah, Taipei's black sesame soup确实有独特的韵味，那种绵密顺滑简直让人难忘~ 🤔 

说到savory food吸引我的地方，大概是它能通过不同层次的调味构建出丰富的味觉体验吧。就像mapo tofu里的麻辣鲜香层层递进，每一口都有新的细节冒出来。相比之下，sweet food总显得有点单维度了。

不过我最近在研究怎么把分子料理的技术用到传统中餐里，特别是像黑芝麻汤圆这类甜品。你提到slow-braised beef的umami和mapo tofu的spice层次，这让我想到或许可以用低温慢煮的方式提取食材的本味，再结合fermentation来增加depth 💡

话说回来，你觉得这种对味道层次的追求，是不是也反映了我们处理问题时喜欢找multiple angles的思维方式？🚀
[A]: Fascinating! You’ve touched on something quite profound — the way our sensory preferences mirror our intellectual inclinations. I find that just as a well-structured poem reveals new meanings with each reading, a savory dish unfolds its flavors gradually, rewarding patience and attention. It’s no wonder you’d draw parallels between molecular techniques and traditional forms; it reminds me of how T.S. Eliot reworked classical motifs through modernist fragmentation. 

Your idea of applying slow extraction and fermentation to black sesame soup — intriguing! Have you considered using sous-vide to control the emulsification of oils and starches? The texture could become even more velvety without losing the nutty depth. 

And yes, I do believe our pursuit of layered flavors reflects a broader cognitive tendency. We’re drawn to complexity, to the interplay of known elements in unexpected arrangements. Much like literary analysis, isn’t it? One begins with the text, but only through careful deconstruction — and sometimes reconstruction — does its richness reveal itself. 

Have you experimented with any particular pairings yet? I’m curious how fermentation might deepen the sesame base without overpowering its essence.
[B]: Oh, I love how you connected that to literary analysis — totally spot on 🤔. It’s like dissecting a poem’s structure while still appreciating its rhythm. And yeah, sous-vide is definitely on my radar for the sesame base; being able to lock in a precise temp could help preserve its aromatic profile while enhancing mouthfeel. 

As for pairings, I’ve been playing around with a black garlic & black sesame combo 💡— earthy meets umami, with just a whisper of natural sweetness. Think of it as balancing depth without tipping into bitterness. The next step is to test controlled fermentation using koji mold 🚀, which might add that subtle tang and complexity you get from aged cheeses. Imagine all that in a silky, bite-sized form... very exciting stuff!

Do you ever find yourself drawing flavor parallels when you're reading poetry? Like, does Eliot ever taste like smoked paprika or something equally unexpected? 😄
[A]: Oh, absolutely — your analogy is more accurate than you might think. There are poems that  carry the weight of smoked paprika — sharp, slightly acrid, yet oddly inviting. Eliot, for instance, often tastes like a slow-burning spice — not in the chili sense, but in the way clove or star anise lingers at the back of the throat, demanding attention. His lines don’t dissolve easily; they simmer.

I’ve long thought of Gerard Manley Hopkins as possessing a kind of umami quality — deep, brothy, full of texture and resonance. His sprung rhythm feels almost chewy, doesn’t it? And Emily Dickinson — now there’s a poet who balances sweet and savory with surgical precision. Tart berries on the tongue, perhaps? A little burst of acidity wrapped in something delicately floral and unexpected.

Your black garlic and sesame concept fascinates me precisely because it embraces contradiction without resolving it — much like reading a poem that refuses to yield a single meaning. Have you considered how presentation might enhance this tension? After all, taste isn’t just flavor — it’s also anticipation, shaped by sight, texture, even sound.
[B]: Oh, I could  your description of Eliot — smoky clove with a side of existential burn 😄. Totally get what you're saying about Dickinson too; she's like a perfectly balanced xiaolongbao — delicate skin holding something unexpectedly intense inside.

Presentation? Now  where things get really fun 💡. Imagine serving the black garlic & sesame bite on a slate slab with a dusting of activated charcoal — visual contrast meets texture play. Maybe even a hint of aromatic smoke released when you lift the lid? A little theatrics never hurt 🚀.

I’ve also been toying with the idea of contrasting temperatures — think warm sesame sphere resting on a bed of chilled, pickled berry granita. Sweetness hits first, then the savory kicks in like a delayed punchline. 

You mentioned sound — have you ever thought how certain dishes  or  in a way that mirrors poetic meter? Like, a crispy crust followed by a soft center... almost iambic in nature? Da-DUM, Da-DUM 😏
[A]: Oh, I love that — culinary iambic pentameter! Da-DUM indeed. The crunch as a stressed syllable, the melt as the unstressed — it’s quite poetic, when you think about it. Texture becomes rhythm, and suddenly dining feels an awful lot like reading.

Your warm sesame sphere with chilled granita? Brilliant. It sounds like a sonnet with a volta served on a plate — that moment when the temperature shifts, and the flavor argument turns. And the charcoal dusted slate — theatrical, yes, but in the best kind of way. It reminds me of reading Yeats by candlelight: atmosphere shapes interpretation.

I wonder, have you ever tried pairing such a dish with a specific poem or literary theme? I can almost imagine serving your creation alongside a recitation of  — the tension of flavors echoing that lingering hesitation in the lines. Or perhaps something more whimsical — a bit of Edward Lear to offset the intensity.

Do you see this as a form of literary criticism through cuisine? Because honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised. We’ve been analyzing texts for centuries — why not taste them?
[B]: Oh, now  a thought worth savoring — literary criticism through cuisine 🤔. Why not indeed? After all, both are about interpretation, context, and the layering of meaning. I mean, imagine hosting a dinner where each course is a stanza from , building tension and release with every bite 🚀.

I haven’t officially paired dishes with poems yet, but you’ve lit a fuse here 😄. Picture this: a tasting menu where each dish interprets a specific poet or era. Maybe Imagism served on minimalist plates with clean, bold flavors — think pickled radish foam over a sesame soil. Or a surrealist course that defies logic, flavor-wise — like burnt honey with fermented chili oil. 

And yeah, Edward Lear would be perfect for palate reset — something playful and absurd, maybe a cucumber sorbet with edible flowers that glow under blacklight 💡. Keeps things whimsical without being cloying.

Honestly, the more I think about it, the more food feels like another language — one that communicates emotion and structure without a single word. So why not critique through taste? I’d trade footnotes for flavor notes any day 😉. What poem would  want to eat first?
[A]: Oh, what a delicious question — and quite a challenge! If I could eat a poem, I think I’d start with . Yes, yes — hear me out. It would be an ambitious menu, but imagine the structure: five sections, five courses, each dish capturing that fractured modernist consciousness.

First course — : a deconstructed garden salad in ashes of burnt rosemary, evoking both fertility and desolation. A single drop of citrus vinaigrette, symbolic of “April is the cruellest month.” Subtle, yet disorienting.

For , perhaps a dish that starts opulent — saffron risotto with edible gold leaf — then collapses into something stark and industrial, like chilled steel-cut oats with vinegar mist. Jarring juxtapositions, just as Eliot intended.

Then  — now there’s room for spice, for indulgence turned to exhaustion. Maybe a rich duck confit spring roll with honey-soy glaze that leaves your tongue oddly dry. Spiritual depletion on a plate.

And ? A cleansing palate shot of seafoam essence — briny, cold, over far too quickly. Fitting, don’t you think?

But oh, I’d love to hear your take — how would you plate ? Or would you choose another poem entirely? Perhaps something more lyrical, more luscious?
[B]: Oh wow —  as a tasting menu? I’m obsessed 🚀. That’s next-level literary cuisine right there. And yes, your vision is spot on — especially that  course. Contrast is everything in both the poem and the plate.

If I were to run with it, I’d lean even harder into the sensory disorientation for . Maybe a deconstructed “cocktail hour” setup — fake glamour, all illusion. Picture this: molecular caviar made from bitter melon foam sitting atop a sugared wafer — sweet at first, then bitter, just like those hollow men and women “satisfying a man’s curiosity at one desire.”

And for , where the poem fractures completely… we go avant-garde with texture chaos. A dish that looks whole but falls apart the moment you touch it — maybe a sesame-crusted sphere filled with miso-laced quinoa porridge and wild mushroom dust 💡. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it would .

Honestly though, if I had to pick another poem to eat, I’d go with something lush and unapologetically sensual — Neruda’s . Talk about turning tragedy into taste 🤔. Imagine plating that — beauty and loss on the same fork.

So, are we opening a concept restaurant or what? I call dibs on the dessert course — it’s gonna be a  with a whisper of star anise. Served with a side of Eliot quotes 😄.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the clink of metaphorical glasses —  to our literary-epicurean venture! 🥂 A concept restaurant? Of course we are — and you’re the head chef, naturally. I’ll handle the ambiance and wine pairings (with carefully annotated tasting notes, naturally).

Your take on  with that deceptive caviar — brilliant! It’s not just irony on a plate, it’s irony , like pearls of false promise. And the  dish sounds like something Mallarmé would attempt if he’d ever been handed a sous-vide machine instead of a quill.

As for Neruda’s tuna ode — what a sublime choice. There’s such reverence in that poem, a kind of sacred mourning for beauty slain by necessity. The dish must reflect both majesty and melancholy. Perhaps seared albacore with saffron foam and a drizzle of anchovy reduction — opulent, fleeting, elegiac. One almost feels guilty for enjoying it.

And your dessert plan? Perfection. Black sesame xiaolongbao — a perfect echo of Eliot’s juxtapositions: warm and cool, solid and liquid, ancient and modern. And star anise? Yes, yes — that lingering aftertaste, like the final line of a difficult poem that refuses to leave you alone.

So tell me, shall we name the place ? Or perhaps ? I’m leaning toward the latter. It has a nice ring, don’t you think?
[B]: Oh, I  "Stirred by Syntax" — sounds like a place where the menu doubles as a reading list 📚🍴. We’ll have to put Borges in the dessert section though; his metaphysical labyrinths definitely taste like something rich and dark with a hidden center 😏.

And yes, let’s absolutely go all-in on that tuna dish — your seared albacore idea is next-level poetry on a plate. It needs just a hint of char on the outside too, like the scorched edges of a manuscript that still holds beauty inside. Pair it with a dry vermouth-based foam for that briny elegance, and maybe a whisper of citrus zest to echo Neruda’s reverence.

Back-of-house, I’m already dreaming up a fermentation station dedicated entirely to aging literary sauces — imagine a miso-aged soy sauce infused with ink-black squid pasta residue… call it “The Black Dahlia Reduction” for dramatic flair 💡.

Front-of-house? Definitely needs a playlist of Eliot readings layered under lo-fi ambient beats — enhances the dining rhythm, you know? Da-DUM, Da-DUM… preferably over a glass of that wine you’re curating 🚀.

So when do we open? I say we start testing dishes this weekend. You bring the wine pairings, I’ll bring the sous-vide setup — and  some edible sonnets printed in rice paper 🤔. Deal?
[A]: Deal — and a most delicious one at that. I shall arrive with not one, but  carefully selected wines: a bone-dry vermouth for Neruda’s albacore, a smoky pinot noir to accompany the umami-rich conclusion of , and — because we must honor the absurd — a sparkling rosé infused with hibiscus and a whisper of bergamot, just for Lear’s glowing cucumber sorbet.

Your fermentation station is pure genius. The  sounds ominously exquisite — dark, brooding, slightly mysterious. I can already imagine it drizzled sparingly over a deconstructed beef tartare, served on a page torn from a 1920s detective novel. Noir on a plate.

And edible sonnets on rice paper? Oh, you are a visionary. I suggest we begin with a quatrain from Shakespeare’s Sonnet 118 — “Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, / So does each petty thought in me explore…” — printed in ink made from squid ink and black sesame paste. It would dissolve slowly on the tongue, wouldn’t it? A flavor that fades with meaning.

As for opening — let’s say autumn. There’s something appropriately modernist about launching our little literary feast in September, when the air turns crisp and everyone’s ready for a little fragmentation with their dinner. We’ll call it a soft opening: , preview performances only, with a full premiere timed for the solstice.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go reorganize my spice rack alphabetically — clearly, we have work to do.
[B]: Ah, autumn it is — perfect for dramatic flavor profiles and even more dramatic metaphors 🍂🍷. I’m already picturing the soft opening — dim lighting, slow jazz reimagined as lo-fi, and a menu that reads like an experimental novel.

Your wine lineup sounds  good — especially that hibiscus/rosé combo for Lear’s sorbet. Sparkling + floral + absurd? That’s basically literary dessert porn 😄. And the noir-themed beef tartare with  over torn manuscript pages? Chef’s kiss AND a PhD thesis in one bite 🚀.

I’ll start drafting the preliminary menu this week — maybe use LaTeX so it looks academic but still clean (nerdy? absolutely. Unapologetic? You bet). Oh, and don’t get me started on that squid ink & sesame sonnet paper — we’re basically inventing edible hermeneutics here 💡.

See you soon in the lab, partner. Bring your appetite for risk — and maybe a fire extinguisher 😉.
[A]: Ah, yes — LaTeX menus, edible hermeneutics, and a fire extinguisher  the symbolic flames of modernism leap off the page. You truly speak my language.

I shall bring not only my appetite for risk, but also a well-worn copy of  — for inspiration, of course, and perhaps a few dramatic readings while we sear miso-aged proteins. And don’t worry, I’ve already cleared my weekend: lab coats pressed, tasting notes drafted, and a playlist in the works that may or may not feature Tom Eliot recited over trap beats 🎧

I do hope you’re partial to controlled chaos in the kitchen — I suspect we’ll be dancing on the edge of culinary madness before this is over. But then again, isn’t that where all great art begins?

See you soon, fellow conspirator in taste and theory. Let us stir syntax — and perhaps, just perhaps, change the way the world reads flavor. 🔥🍴
[B]: Oh,  is practically my middle name — or should be, right next to “Carter” and “over-caffeinated Raspberry Pi tinkerer” 😄. And yes — ? That’s not just ambiance, that’s a full-blown aesthetic manifesto.

I’ll make sure the lab has all the essentials: fireproof surfaces, backup immersion circulators, and at least one wall dedicated to  mood board madness. I’m picturing sticky notes with quotes from Woolf mixed with flavor profiles — 

And Tom Eliot over trap? 🤯 Pure genius. Imagine  chopped and screwed — slow, heavy, and deep-fried in metaphor. It’ll hit like a Michelin-starred existential crisis 🚀.

So yeah — let’s stir syntax, fry sonnets, and maybe accidentally invent a new genre of dining where footnotes taste better than the main course 💡🍴. See you in the chaos, partner. Don’t forget the squid ink pens — we’ve got sonnets to print.
[A]: Oh,  — I’m afraid that sticky note may just be the first line of a new literary movement: . I shall start drafting the manifesto tonight, likely at 2AM, while staring into the sous-vide bath as if it holds the meaning of life.

And squid ink pens? Inspired. We’ll need them not only for sonnets but also for dramatic flourishes on the menu — perhaps a smudge across the page to evoke both despair and flavor depth. I shall also bring my antique typewriter to print limited edition tasting menus — carbon copies only, naturally. Nothing says “edible postmodernism” like a slightly smudged ribbon imprint.

As for Tom Eliot over trap beats — yes, yes, and yes. If done correctly, diners will leave feeling equal parts enlightened and hungry, as though they've dined in the mind of Woolf while dancing through a Hong Kong night market.

I shall arrive armed with squid ink, wine pairings, and a copy of  — just to see if we can make the  episode taste like kombu reduction. Is that ambitious? Possibly. Is that dangerous? Almost certainly.

But then again, what is literature if not a carefully controlled burn?

See you in the chaos, dear partner. May our syntax be stirred, our metaphors edible, and our kitchen only mildly on fire. 🔥📝🍴
[B]: Oh, ? I’m already drafting the first宣言 (manifesto) in my head — probably should’ve been working on code or a blockchain schema, but no, I went full Joyce-meets-junmai-daiginjo instead 🚀.

I  the typewriter idea. Carbon copies only? That’s not just presentation, that’s a damn philosophy. And squid ink smudges as aesthetic despair? Chef’s kiss meets art school dropout vibes 💡🖋️. We should serve each course with a footnote referencing obscure literary theory — bonus points if it's in a font only a scholar or a very dedicated foodie would bother deciphering.

And  with kombu reduction? Oh, you're playing with fire — and possibly the digestive tract of the modern diner 😄. But hey, if anyone can make “Proteus” taste like umami and existential drift, it’s us.

I’ll bring the blow torch — for both the crème brûlée finish on our metaphorical sonnets  emergency blockchain debugging 🔥. You handle the ink, the wine, and the madness. I’ll handle the fermentation, the footnotes, and quietly praying the smoke alarm doesn’t go off before dessert.

See you at the intersection of syntax and spice, partner. Let’s make history taste good 🍶📖🍴.
