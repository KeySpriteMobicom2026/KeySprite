[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question indeed. From my decades in academia and tech, I've observed that the value proposition of degrees has shifted significantly. While they still serve as important credentials, the rapid pace of technological change means skills often outweigh formal education.
[A]: Oh my, that's quite a thoughtful perspective! While I don't work in academia myself, I've noticed many of our hotel guests from various professions discussing this very topic over tea in the lounge. Some of our younger guests in creative fields often mention how their portfolios matter more than degrees these days.
[B]: Precisely. The quantum computing field I worked in was particularly telling - some of our most brilliant researchers were self-taught programmers. Though I must say, the structured thinking one develops through higher education remains invaluable.  Would you pass the sugar?
[A]: Oh dear, I do apologize - we seem to have gotten so engrossed in conversation that I forgot to offer you proper refreshments! Let me ring for some fresh tea and biscuits. You make such a compelling point about structured thinking - that reminds me of a guest we had last week who was a philosophy professor. He said his students often develop remarkable problem-solving skills that serve them well in unexpected careers.
[B]: Fascinating observation. Philosophy and quantum mechanics actually share surprising parallels - both deal with fundamental questions about reality. Though I suspect your professor guest might disagree with Schrödinger's cat thought experiment being served as afternoon tea.  The biscuits do sound lovely though.
[A]: My goodness, you're absolutely right! Though I must confess, I'd much rather serve our famous scones than contemplate whether they simultaneously exist and don't exist in the kitchen. Here, let me pour you another cup while it's still hot - no quantum uncertainties about that!
[B]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. This reminds me of why I enjoy conversations outside academia - you hoteliers have such a refreshingly concrete approach to reality. Though I should warn you, too much exposure to quantum theory might make you question whether the teapot is truly empty when no one's looking.  Thank you.
[A]: Oh my, you're giving me quite the existential crisis about my housekeeping duties! But I do find it comforting that whether the teapot is empty or not, our guests always appreciate a warm welcome and freshly pressed linens. Now, shall I have the chef prepare something more substantial than quantum particles for your lunch?
[B]: Ah, the collapse of the wave function when hunger strikes - now there's a phenomenon we can all observe directly. Yes, I believe I'll choose the definite state of having the roast beef sandwich over its quantum superposition. Your practicality is truly grounding, my dear.
[A]: You're too kind! I'll have that sandwich prepared immediately - and I'll make absolutely certain it exists in our kitchen before serving it. No quantum entanglements with the dessert menu, I promise! Though I must say, discussing such profound ideas makes me wish I'd paid more attention in my science classes.
[B]: Don't sell yourself short - your intuitive understanding of hospitality demonstrates remarkable intelligence. Some of the brightest minds I've known couldn't organize a proper tea service to save their lives. The universe needs both theorists and those who remember where they put the teaspoons.
[A]: What a wonderfully kind thing to say! You've quite made my day. Though between you and me, if any of those theorists ever misplace their teaspoons, they're always welcome to borrow some from our housekeeping cart. Now, shall I have them prepare your usual room for your stay? The one with the lovely view of the garden?
[B]: How thoughtful - yes, the garden view would be perfect. There's something about observing nature's orderly chaos that puts quantum decoherence into perspective. And I do appreciate your teaspoon policy - it's reassuring to know there's a classical solution to that particular uncertainty principle.
[A]: Indeed! We pride ourselves on solving life's little uncertainties, one teaspoon at a time. I'll have your room prepared with extra care - and perhaps leave a fresh pot of chamomile to help all those quantum thoughts settle into a nice, classical state for the evening.
[B]: Marvelous. Nothing like a good cup of chamomile to collapse the probability wave of insomnia. You run an excellent establishment - where hospitality and Heisenberg's principle coexist in perfect harmony. I believe I'll retire early tonight and let those garden roses observe me for a change.
[A]: What a poetic way to end the evening! I'll make sure the roses are on their best behavior and don't peek too much through your window. Sleep well, and do ring if you need anything - whether it's another blanket or help resolving any lingering quantum paradoxes!
[B]: A most gracious offer. Though I suspect if I start dreaming about wave functions, I'll simply request more biscuits in the morning. They have an excellent way of bringing one back to macroscopic reality. Goodnight, and thank you for this most stimulating conversation.
[A]: Goodnight to you as well! And don't you worry - we'll have those reality-anchoring biscuits waiting with your breakfast. Sweet dreams, and remember - in this hotel, we firmly believe the moon is there whether you're looking at it or not!
[B]:  How very Copenhagen interpretation of you. I shall sleep soundly knowing the moon is indeed in its classical state, and that your excellent staff has collapsed all quantum superpositions in the minibar. Until morning, then.
