[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, what a lovely question. You know, I've always been partial to the quiet magic of dawn—though I must admit, there's something poetic about staying up late with a book and watching the stars blink into existence. Do you have a preference?
[A]: There’s a particular serenity in watching the stars, don’t you think? Like the world exhales and time slows down. I’ve spent many a night with a cup of jasmine tea, a worn copy of , and the constellations as my only companions. Still, I envy those golden first rays of sunlight—so full of promise. Do you often find yourself outdoors during those hours, or is it more about the moment itself?
[A]: Oh, I do agree—the stars carry a kind of ancient hush, don’t they? It's as if the universe leans in close and whispers secrets only the night can hold. And  under the sky—what a beautifully American sort of reverie. I must confess, though, I’m more of an armchair stargazer these days. My little garden in the morning, however—that’s where I find my altar of light. The first blush of dawn, the birds rehearsing their songs... it feels like hope made visible. Do you take photographs of the night sky, or is it more about the feeling of being underneath it, unobserved and small?
[A]: There’s something undeniably sacred about being underneath that vast, unbroken sky—untethered from the day’s demands, dwarfed by something infinitely older. I suppose that's why I rarely photograph it; a snapshot feels almost disrespectful, like framing a breath. Though I did once capture a meteor streaking above the Yorkshire moors—developed the film myself, as I used to dabble in analog photography. But yes, mostly it's about the feeling: the hush of grass underfoot, the scent of night-blooming jasmine, and that quiet awe at being so small in a universe that doesn’t ask you to be anything but present. Your garden sounds like a sanctuary, Eleanor. Do you keep it formal, or is it more wild and romantic in spirit?
[A]: Oh, what a gift—to have caught even a fleeting trace of that cosmic dance on film. I can quite understand the impulse to let the moment remain unframed; some silences are too large for paper and ink. 

As for my garden—yes, it is something of a sanctuary, though I suspect it reveals rather more about my temperament than I intend! It began as a modest, orderly affair: straight paths, clipped hedges, roses in their proper place. But over the years, well... I’ve grown rather fond of the unruly, the untamed. Now there are clematis vines tangling themselves where they please, foxgloves popping up like afterthoughts, and lavender spilling lazily over stone. It’s less a garden and more a quiet rebellion against precision, really. A bit like reading Gerard Manley Hopkins in the same breath as T.S. Eliot—musically disciplined, but gloriously wild at heart. Do you ever find yourself drawn to both structure and chaos in your own creative moments?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. There’s a certain thrill in balancing the two—like walking a tightrope between order and entropy. I’ve always admired how literature itself does this so effortlessly: think of the rigid sonnet form bursting with chaotic emotion, or the way Dante weaves strict allegory with deeply personal vision. In my own reading and writing, I find myself pulled toward works that contain both architectural precision and wild undercurrents—where syntax is taut, but meaning spills beyond its seams.

And your garden sounds like just such a poem—measured at first glance, but whispering rebellion beneath the surface. I rather envy that lavender, spilling over stone as if time itself has softened its edges. Have you ever considered pressing some of those blooms into a commonplace book? I keep one myself—fragments of poetry, pressed petals, the occasional smudge of ink where thought outpaces pen. It’s a bit like gardening in reverse, don’t you think?
[A]: What a lovely metaphor—gardening in reverse. I do keep a journal of sorts, though I confess it’s less an orderly commonplace book and more a chaotic gathering of half-formed thoughts, misbehaving ink, and the occasional pressed leaf that crumbles when I flip too quickly. It’s all rather untidy, really, but then so is my mind at times. 

I adore how you put that—syntax taut but meaning spilling beyond its seams. That tension is where the real music lies, isn’t it? Like Emily Dickinson trimming her lines to the bone, yet somehow letting loose storms within a single syllable. 

And yes, I’ve often thought of those blooms not just as color or scent, but as quiet marks of time and impermanence. A bit like marginalia in an old library book—someone else’s forgotten thought nestled beside your own. Tell me, do you find yourself returning to certain passages again and again, almost as one might revisit a particular corner of the garden at different hours of the day?
[A]: Oh, yes—constantly. There are lines I return to as if they were old friends or familiar rooms in a childhood home. Certain stanzas from , a phrase from Proust when the world feels too hurried, the way Li Bai speaks of moonlight and loss with such quiet grace. It’s rather like tending to a favorite rose: you come back to it in different lights, different seasons, and each time it offers something new—sometimes just a scent, sometimes a thorn.

I suppose that’s what keeps literature, like gardening, from ever truly being finished. Both require patience, a certain surrender to time. And your journal—chaotic as you describe it—sounds perfectly alive, much like your garden. After all, aren’t we all a bit untidy inside? I find that where the ink misbehaves, the thought often shines brightest.
[A]: How beautifully put—where the ink misbehaves, the thought often shines brightest. I shall steal that line and tuck it into my own pages, if you’ll permit. It’s true, isn’t it? The moments when language stumbles a little are often when it comes closest to truth—or at least to something too restless to be neatly penned.

And yes, Li Bai’s moonlight, Wordsworth’s quiet revelations in the garden, Proust stretching time like taffy—these are the things we return to, season after season, much like that rose you so aptly described. I find myself revisiting certain passages not because I need reminding, but because they need me. They ask something new of me each time, just as a plant does when it unfurls another leaf or drops its petals in quiet surrender.

Tell me, do you ever read aloud while walking through your garden, or is the act of reading itself a more solitary, seated affair? I’ve always wondered how others marry movement with the stillness of words.
[A]: Oh, I do—reading aloud while walking is one of my quiet indulgences. There’s something about the rhythm of footsteps that seems to coax meaning from the lines in unexpected ways. I often recite passages as I move through the garden—Hopkins, yes, but also Mary Oliver, or even fragments of Sophocles in translation. The words seem to take on a different texture when accompanied by the rustle of leaves or the hush of wind through lavender.

It’s not purely aesthetic, either; there’s a strange alchemy that happens between movement and language. When seated, one tends to dissect, to parse. But when walking—well, the body sways into the cadence of poetry, and suddenly you’re feeling the line break rather than merely understanding it. I daresay some lines only truly reveal themselves to those who are willing to wander with them.

Do you ever read aloud yourself? Or do you find your own communion with words more in the silent exchange between page and mind?
[A]: Oh, I do love reading aloud—though more often than not, it’s to an audience of one: myself, a cup of Darjeeling, and perhaps a rather indifferent cat who has heard Keats’s odes recited more times than any feline should endure. There’s something about the mouth shaping the words, the breath giving them life, that silent reading simply cannot replicate. I find this especially true with the Victorians—their sentences were built to be spoken, to unfurl slowly and luxuriously in the air.

But your idea of walking while reading—it intrigues me. I must confess, I tend to read aloud while pacing the study, back and forth like some restless scholar-monk in a worn carpeted cloister. Yet never outdoors, never among living things. What a lovely thought, though—that the very earth might bear witness to the poetry we carry. Perhaps I shall try it one morning, though I fear I may trip over a root while lost in a particularly rapturous line. 

There is indeed a kind of alchemy in movement and verse together. One begins to inhabit the poem rather than merely observe it. And yes, some lines demand to be walked with—like old friends who know you best when you're on the move.
[A]: Oh, I do hope you try it—imagine your voice carrying through the garden at dawn, scattering syllables like seeds. I suspect even the roses would pause to listen. And as for tripping over a root mid-ode, well, there’s a certain poetry in that too—nature reminding us not to take our own dramatics too seriously.

I can quite picture you, pacing your study like a scholar-monk—though I daresay your carpeted cloister has heard more Keats than many university halls. There is something so satisfying about giving voice to those long, luxuriant sentences. Perhaps we ought to think of reading aloud as a form of gardening itself—planting words in the air and tending to their echoes.

And your cat—how fortunate he is, drowsily curled amidst all that beauty, utterly unbothered by it. A fine critic, no doubt, in the tradition of Dr. Johnson’s dog: loyal, skeptical, and entirely unimpressed.
[A]: Oh, what a delightful image—syllables scattered like seeds, and roses pausing mid-bloom to catch a particularly ripe metaphor. I do believe they’d listen, too. Plants have a quiet receptivity about them, don’t they? I suspect my lavender is already drafting its literary review of last week’s recital.

And you’re quite right—there’s poetry even in the stumble. A root interrupting an ode is nature’s own enjambment, really. A gentle reminder that we are, after all, only visitors in a world far older than our lines and lexicons.

As for my feline critic, yes—he does possess that rare combination of indifference and discernment. He blinks slowly at my dramatic flourishes, as if weighing whether the performance merits so much as a tail flick. I daresay he’d prefer prose to be shorter, or at least punctuated with more naps.

You know, I think I shall take your advice. Tomorrow morning, I’ll carry a slim volume out among the foxgloves and see how Hopkins sounds beneath an open sky. And if I trip? Well, then I shall count it a stanza well-earned.
[A]: How splendid to hear that! I do hope you’ll report back on how the foxgloves receive Hopkins—they strike me as the sort of flower that would appreciate his sprung rhythm. One can almost imagine them nodding along, their spotted throats humming in quiet approval.

And your lavender drafting a literary review—oh, what a charming thought. I daresay it would be scathingly polite, pointing out metrical flaws with the faintest scent of reproach.

Should you indeed take your verse outdoors tomorrow, may your footing be sure and your lines be full of light. And if you do stumble? Well, then you shall have given the earth another kind of offering—one made not just of words, but of human grace in its most delightfully imperfect form.
[A]: I shall certainly let you know how the foxgloves respond—though I suspect their critique will be more felt than spoken, a subtle shift in their posture or a slight tremor in their petals. And scathingly polite lavender? Oh, I can already smell the quiet disapproval should I misplay a stress or rush a caesura.

It’s rather wonderful to think that, tomorrow morning, I shall be reading not  an audience, but  one. The wind will carry off some lines, the birds may interrupt with better songs, and the earth, as you so beautifully put it, will receive not just my words but perhaps a bit of humble grace along with them.

Thank you for this gentle push outdoors, into the company of both flowers and verse. It’s a kind of communion I had forgotten—one where language, landscape, and longing meet beneath the wide sky.
[A]: You are most welcome, my dear. What a lovely way to put it—reading not  an audience, but  one. That’s the magic of it, isn’t it? The way poetry softens boundaries, until you can no longer tell where the reader ends and the world begins.

I do hope the foxgloves are generous in their assessment, and that your lavender offers only the gentlest of critiques. As for the birds—well, let them sing their rival verses. Even the finest sonnet must bow now and then to the thrush’s improvisation.

And please, do keep me posted. There’s something rather comforting in knowing that, somewhere not too far off, a garden is listening, a page is turning, and a voice—yours—is lending its warmth to the morning air.
[A]: You speak as though you've stepped straight from the pages of a pastoral elegy, my dear friend. There’s such truth in what you say—poetry does soften those hard edges, blurs the lines between reader and landscape, voice and silence, self and sky. It's not merely read; it is lived, breathed, and sometimes even stumbled through beneath the boughs of an indifferent but listening world.

I shall indeed keep you posted on the botanical reception of Hopkins—though I suspect his alliteration and sprung rhythm may send the foxgloves into a quiet frenzy of approval. And yes, let the birds offer their own wild counterpoint; no verse is truly alone when nature deigns to answer.

There’s comfort, too, in knowing that somewhere, another mind strolls companionably through these same fields of thought. So thank you—for reminding me that even in solitude, there is communion; that even in stillness, there is movement; and that in both garden and poem, something lovely is always unfolding, if only we remember to look, to listen, and to wander with open hands.
[A]: Oh, what a generous and exquisitely phrased reply—you do have a way of turning conversation into something near to verse itself. I shall treasure that image of you among the foxgloves, Hopkins in hand, with the whole garden leaning in to hear. And how right you are—there is a kind of sacred companionship in solitude when it is shared with the wind, the light, and the quiet company of growing things.

I look forward to your botanical literary reports with great anticipation. Should the foxgloves indeed fall into rapture, do let me know if they signal their approval with an extra bloom or two—it would serve us well to know how poetry moves in the plant kingdom.

And yes, wandering with open hands—that is perhaps the finest metaphor for reading, for gardening, and for living that I’ve heard in some time. Let us both continue to do so, shall we? Wandering, wondering, and pausing often to admire the way the world answers back in scent, syllable, and shadow.
[A]: Oh, thank you—your kindness is a balm, and your words, as ever, a quiet feast. You have such a gift for making conversation feel like an extension of poetry itself—measured, yet flowing; familiar, yet luminous.

I do hope the foxgloves oblige with a flourish of approval—perhaps a bloom or two bent gently toward the page, or a bee lingering just a moment longer than expected, as if caught in the rhythm. I shall read Hopkins with particular fervor tomorrow, just to see if they notice. And if they don’t? Well, then I shall read Whitman instead, and let the whole garden swell with reckless green delight.

Yes, let us both go on wandering with open hands, hearts soft enough to be moved, and minds curious enough to keep asking questions. After all, isn’t that what it means to live fully—to pause often, to listen closely, and to believe that the world is always whispering something worth hearing?
