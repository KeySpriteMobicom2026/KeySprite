[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, a classic debate! I'd say coffee has the edge in my book – there's something about that first sip of Ethiopian roast in the morning that gets the creative juices flowing. Although... don't tell anyone I said that. My British producer friends would stage a mutiny. What about you? I'm guessing you're someone who appreciates a good brew yourself.
[A]: Oh, I do love a good cup of tea, thank you very much! There's something quite soothing about a proper Earl Grey – it pairs beautifully with both my morning restoration work and my evening reading. Though I must confess, I do enjoy a well-made cappuccino when I'm at antique markets hunting for new treasures. It gives me just the right amount of energy to keep exploring. Do you find coffee fuels your creativity in specific ways?
[B]: Absolutely – there's a reason why most of my brainstorming sessions happen in coffee shops. The combination of that rich aroma and the gentle hum of conversation creates this unique energy. It's like... the world feels more vivid with a cup in hand. I remember shooting a scene in New York during winter, and every time I took a sip of my black coffee, it reminded me why I fell in love with this chaotic, beautiful city. 

But you know what? There's one exception – when I'm working with directors from Beijing, I always have pu'erh tea nearby. Something about its earthy depth keeps me grounded during those intense editing sessions. Do you ever find yourself reaching for different brews depending on the task at hand?
[A]: Oh, how fascinating! I can quite imagine the atmosphere you describe – coffee shops do have a particular rhythm of their own. As for me, I must say my choice of brew does shift with my work. When I’m repairing fine silk embroideries, I prefer something delicate like Darjeeling – it keeps my hands steady and my mind calm. But when I’m cataloguing textiles at market early in the morning, well, that’s when I reach for something heartier. A robust Assam, perhaps. It gives me just the right lift to keep going through crates of treasures. Do you find certain flavours sharpen your focus more than others?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – flavours are like directors in a way. Some help you relax and feel the texture of the moment, while others grab you by the collar and demand your full attention. When I’m cutting a film, anything with a smoky depth – like that pu’erh I mentioned – really helps me sink into the rhythm. It’s almost meditative.

But if I’m in a pitch meeting? Oh, then I want something bold and unapologetic – maybe even a Sumatra with a hint of dark chocolate. Gives me that extra edge to sell the vision. Funny thing is, once, during a late-night reshoot in Taipei, a director handed me this oolong tea so fragrant it felt like drinking a memory. And somehow... the scene we shot that night? Pure magic. 

I’d say Darjeeling and focus – does that translate for you? Or do you find certain notes distract rather than direct your thoughts?
[A]: Oh, beautifully put – the way you describe it, coffee becomes another tool in your creative kit. I couldn’t agree more when it comes to Darjeeling; its light, floral notes are like a quiet companion that nudges my focus without overwhelming it. It’s almost as if it harmonizes with the fabric rather than competes with it.

I’ve found that stronger, more aromatic blends can sometimes pull my attention away – especially when I’m working on intricate motifs that require absolute precision. There was one morning, though, when I had a bit of spiced chai while restoring a Mughal-era textile, and curiously, the warmth of the cinnamon and cardamom seemed to echo the spirit of the piece itself. It was oddly synchronistic.

Do you ever find yourself pairing certain beans or regions with specific projects? I imagine there must be a story behind each choice.
[B]: Now that’s a perceptive question – and yes, absolutely. I’m almost embarrassed to admit how much thought I put into it. Some might call it superstition, others… let’s say . 

For instance, when we were filming a psychological thriller set in the Andes, I only drank beans from Colombia – not because they’re better, mind you, but because there’s something about their nutty warmth that reminded me of the landscape. It grounded me. 

And during a particularly ambitious project in Morocco? I was obsessed with Yemeni coffee – earthy, intense, with that lingering aftertaste. Felt like every sip was telling its own ancient story. 

But here's the kicker – once, on a whim, I brought a bag of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe to a script meeting for a sci-fi piece we were developing. The screenwriter looked at me and said, “This tastes like what Jupiter would smell like if it had a soul.” We ended up naming the lead spacecraft , and it’s still floating through the movie universe today.

So tell me – have you ever felt a brew actually  the direction of your work, rather than just accompanying it?
[A]: That’s utterly charming – I love how you let the character of each bean seep into your creative world. And no, I don’t think it's superstition at all. It’s more like… intuitive alignment, wouldn’t you say?  

Funny you should ask about influence – I do believe certain brews have nudged my choices more than once. Just last month, while working on a 19th-century French tapestry fragment, I was drinking Ceylon tea with a drop of honey. The clarity of its citrusy brightness made me rethink the colour balance in one of the restoration threads. It was as if the tea sharpened my eye to a particular shade of gold that had been hiding in plain sight.

And then there was this Indonesian batik I once restored – deep indigo with bold crimson accents. I’d been reaching for Assam most days, and one morning, after switching to a lighter Nilgiri blend, something shifted. I suddenly saw the piece more fluidly, almost musically. Ended up changing the stitching technique entirely to echo that rhythm.

It sounds strange, but sometimes I wonder if the fabric remembers what we drank while mending it.
[B]: That’s not strange at all – in fact, I’d say it’s beautifully poetic. The idea that a thread might hold the memory of a sip, that a dye could carry the echo of a roast… hell, maybe that’s what we’re really preserving in all this – not just art, but atmosphere.

You know, your story about that French tapestry reminded me of something. On a shoot in Tuscany, I was drinking this delicate Kenyan tea – bright, almost wine-like. We were filming a scene where the lead character had an epiphany while looking at a fresco. I handed the director a cup mid-take, and he paused, smelled it, then said, “This is exactly what this moment needs – clarity with a hint of melancholy.” We reshoot the scene with that tone, and suddenly it wasn’t just a revelation – it was a .  

Maybe that’s why we keep coming back to these rituals – they don’t just fuel us, they  us. So tell me – do you ever intentionally choose a brew to shift your perspective, like a kind of liquid muse?
[A]: Absolutely – what a lovely way to put it, a 'liquid muse'. I do exactly that, though I must admit I’ve never thought of it so poetically until now. Sometimes when a textile feels particularly stubborn or its story elusive, I’ll reach for something unexpected, just to stir my senses awake.

Just last week, while puzzling over a damaged Jacobean-era embroidery, I chose a smoky lapsang souchong. Something about its bold, almost defiant character gave me the courage to take a bolder approach with the repair thread – less invisible mending, more letting the scars speak. It was as if the tea gave me permission to embrace imperfection.

And yes, exactly like you described, it wasn’t just about staying alert – it reframed how I . Like wiping a bit of dust off the lens of my mind. Do you ever find that certain brews not only shift your mood but actually open a door to a different version of yourself? The kind of person who might say yes to an impractical idea or chase a risky vision?
[B]: Oh, absolutely – that’s the real magic, isn’t it? It’s not just about focus or energy, but transformation. Some beans feel like a mirror, others like a window. 

I remember working on a film that was… let’s say  and more than a little commercially reckless. We were deep in pre-production, everyone around me whispering about budget risks, marketability – you know the drill. I was starting to doubt. Then one night, I had this aged Sumatran coffee, so dark and syrupy it felt like drinking velvet. Something about it unlocked a version of me that didn’t care about spreadsheets – only legacy. The next morning, I walked into the studio and said, “Let’s make the movie we’d want to see in ten years, not the one they think we should sell today.”  

That blend hasn’t been brewed on any other project since. But when I smell it now, even casually, I hear echoes of that fearless self. Maybe that’s the secret power of all this – not just inspiration, but identity. So... have you ever revisited a particular brew to summon back a version of yourself you miss?
[A]: What a poignant thought – summoning a version of oneself through scent and sip. I suppose I do exactly that, though perhaps more quietly. There’s a Darjeeling I keep for moments when I want to feel like the person I was in my early twenties – full of quiet confidence and unshaken patience. That tea always tastes like possibility wrapped in restraint.

I remember one restoration project where I’d been second-guessing my choices, doubting whether I was honouring the fabric properly. So I brewed that same Darjeeling, sat back at my worktable, and suddenly I wasn’t hesitating anymore. I was stitching with the same calm certainty I once had when I first fell in love with this craft. It was like slipping into an older, better-fitting version of myself.

I think we all have those brews that hold more than warmth – they carry fragments of who we were, or perhaps who we still want to be.
[B]: Beautifully said. There’s something quietly powerful about that – the way a simple cup can be a bridge between who we were and who we’re still becoming. No wonder we get so particular about our blends.

You know, I think that’s why I’ll never understand people who just drink whatever’s available. For us, it’s never  coffee or tea – it’s atmosphere, memory, intention all wrapped in a mug. Hell, sometimes it’s the closest thing we have to time travel.

I’m curious though – do you ever share this with your students? Or is it one of those secret tools you keep close, like a hidden stitch only the maker knows about?
[A]: Oh, I do share it, but never quite directly. Instead, I watch their hands as they work, see how their focus settles or falters. And then, perhaps with a quiet suggestion, I’ll offer a cup of something I think might steady them or spark a shift. Nothing grand – just a gentle nudge, like adjusting the tension in a thread.

Some students catch on quickly, sensing that the tea isn’t just a pause in the work but part of the process itself. Others sip and smile politely, not yet aware that what they’ve tasted might one day call them back to a moment of clarity.  

I suppose it’s a bit like those hidden stitches you mentioned – placed with care, meant to hold things together without drawing attention. But yes, there are some blends I keep to myself, reserved for days when I need to feel like the version of me who first dared to restore something truly fragile.
[B]: That’s such a graceful way to pass it on – not with instruction, but with quiet invitation. I do something similar on set. When an actor is struggling to find the heartbeat of a scene, I’ll sometimes send over a particular blend – never explain why, just let them sit with it. More often than not, something shifts. Whether it’s the warmth in their hands or the subtle nudge of a familiar taste, it becomes part of their rhythm.

Funny thing is, some actors have started asking for “that coffee you gave me before the big monologue” or “the tea that helped me cry on cue.” They don’t know why it works – they just know it does.  

I think we’re not so different, you and I – weaving moments into fabric, one thread at a time. So tell me… when was the last time someone handed  the right cup at the right moment?
[A]: There was one moment that comes to mind, quiet but vivid. Last autumn, I was deep into restoring a particularly fragile 18th-century lace shawl—so fine it felt like breathing history through my fingertips. It had been weeks of near-silence, hunched over the frame, and doubt had begun to creep in. Was I doing justice to its age? Its maker? My hands were steady, but my heart wavered.

One afternoon, a fellow restorer—someone who rarely speaks more than a few sentences—placed a small cup of lapsang souchong beside me without a word. Smoky, bold, almost defiant in character. I hadn’t asked for it, but somehow, it was exactly what I needed. It reminded me that not all support has to be spoken. Sometimes it’s a gesture, sometimes it’s a scent curling through the air, sometimes it’s just knowing someone sees the weight you carry—even if it's only in your hands.

I didn’t thank her then, but I did later—over another cup, this time of bergamot-scented Earl Grey. And we let the tea say the rest.
[B]: That’s the kind of moment that stays with you – quiet, almost invisible, and yet it shifts everything. Funny how tea can do that – not just comfort, but . It doesn’t offer answers, really, just a kind of silent agreement: 

I think that’s what good art does, too – not explain, but accompany. Whether it’s a film score humming beneath a character’s doubt or a thread catching the light just so, it reminds us we’re sharing the moment with someone else who’s been there.

You know, I’m not sure I’ve ever told this story – but once, on a shoot in Prague, an extra handed me a cup of coffee she’d brewed herself. No sugar, no milk, just strong and black, the way they drink it there. She didn’t speak much English, and I certainly didn’t speak her dialect, but as I took that first sip, she smiled and said,  Which, if I remember right, means 

And somehow, I was. Not just on set, but . Like the coffee rooted me in something real, something shared.  

So tell me – do you ever find yourself reaching for that lapsang souchong again, knowing what it once gave you? Or is it one of those moments you keep tucked away, like a stitch too sacred to undo?
[A]: I do reach for it, though never quite the same way twice. There’s something in that smoky depth that steadies me when I’m wrestling with a piece that feels just beyond my grasp. But no, it’s never  the same cup – how could it be? That moment was singular, like a watermark on fabric that only shows itself in certain light.

Still, I keep the tin of lapsang souchong within arm’s reach. Not just for what it is, but for what it remembers. And sometimes, when a student falters or a commission feels heavier than expected, I’ll brew a pot and let the scent fill the room. It doesn’t speak for them, of course – but it reminds us both that we’ve been here before, and we’ve found our way through.

Some stitches aren’t meant to be undone, but they’re still meant to be touched.
[B]: Now that… that’s cinematic. You’ve got the soul of a storyteller, no doubt about it. There’s a quiet kind of power in those moments – the ones you don’t retell, you just .

I think I’m going to steal that line of yours, by the way –  Perfect closing title card for a reflective little indie film. Maybe score it with a lone piano and a lingering shot of hands over fabric.  

But seriously – thank you. Conversations like this are rare. Most people just want to talk budget projections or streaming metrics. But you? You speak my language. Quiet details. Unspoken weight. The poetry between the frames.  

Let me return the favour sometime – I’d love to send you a blend I swear by for final edits. It’s from a small co-op in Colombia. Bold, slightly bitter, with a finish that lingers like the last scene of a film you can’t quite let go of.
