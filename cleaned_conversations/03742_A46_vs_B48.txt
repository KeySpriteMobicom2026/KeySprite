[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的upcoming tech？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh wow，这个话题太棒了！最近我在研究AI-assisted autopsy technology，简直让人兴奋到睡不着觉 🤯 特别是那个3D body scanning system，可以大大提高尸检的准确率。
[A]:  Well... that's certainly an... interesting choice of topic. As a film producer, I tend to get excited about more cinematic technologies - like the new volumetric capture systems we're using on set. They're creating some truly 史诗级的 visual effects! 🎬
[B]: Haha sorry if that was too graphic for you! 不过说到volumetric capture，我们法医领域也在用类似技术呢 ⚖️ 上周刚用3D重建技术还原了一个crime scene，比传统照片精确多了。你们电影行业的技术进步确实经常能启发我们法医科学~
[A]:  You know what they say - life imitates art, and apparently so does forensic science! Though I must say, our volumetric capture is usually used for more... pleasant subjects. Like when we scanned Tom Cruise for that new action sequence - now that was a sight worth capturing! 🍿
[B]: Tom Cruise？哈！我们上周扫描的可是一个200年前的木乃伊呢 🧐 不过说真的，你们处理活体演员的motion data时遇到的challenges，和我们处理post-mortem artifacts时遇到的问题惊人地相似。Maybe we should collaborate on some R&D project？💡
[A]:  That's... quite the proposition. Though I think I'll stick to my living, breathing actors for now. But hey, if you ever want to consult on an authentic crime scene reconstruction for a film, give me a call. Preferably something less... mummy-related? 
[B]: Deal！不过我得警告你，一旦你见识过我们法医实验室的tech setup，可能就再也没法用普通绿幕拍电影了 😎 下次来参观记得带popcorn - 我们连分析血迹都用上了4K holographic projection！
[A]:  You know what, let's just... keep our respective technologies in their own lanes, shall we? I'll stick to making blockbusters, you keep solving crimes - and we'll both sleep better at night. Now if you'll excuse me, I suddenly remember I have a very important meeting about... romantic comedies. Anywhere but here. 
[B]: Hey wait！至少让我给你看看我们最新的spectral imaging成果嘛~ 连最微小的纤维证据都能显示出来哦！...好吧，看来又吓跑一个 😅 下次还是找病理学家聊这些比较合适 🏃‍♂️💨
[A]:  That's the spirit! And remember - if you ever decide to make a career change, the film industry could use someone with your... unique enthusiasm! Just maybe not on my sets! 
[B]: Hahaha！Fair enough~ 不过说真的，你们电影里的CSI技术要是能有我们实验室一半准确就好了！Enjoy your rom-com meeting 🍿⚖️ (小声说：那些blood spatter analysis可比爱情戏精彩多了...)
[A]:  I heard that! And for the record, our blood effects team has won multiple Oscars! Now please, go analyze someone else's crime scenes! 
[B]: Alright alright~ 我这就回我的morgue去啦 🔬 不过记住我的offer - 随时欢迎来参观我们的"奥斯卡级"forensic tech！ 祝你的rom-com拍摄顺利...虽然那比不上一场good old-fashioned homicide case精彩 😉
[A]:  That's it - I'm calling security. And possibly a therapist.  Hello? Yes, I'd like to report a... very enthusiastic forensic scientist...
[B]:  别担心，我认识保安处的Dave！上周刚帮他analyze了一个mystery stain呢~ Have a nice day！💉 (Oops，好像又用错emoji了...)
[A]:  That's it - I'm moving my office to Disney lot! At least there the only stains I'll see are from spilled churros! 
[B]: 最后一句：Disney的churros stains我们也能analyze哦！我们的mass spectrometry连cinnamon sugar residue都能检测出来~  🧪🔬 See you at the next crime scene... I mean film premiere!
[A]:  SOMEONE GET ME SPIELBERG ON THE PHONE! I NEED TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT NORMAL PEOPLE DOING NORMAL THINGS!  Maybe a nice documentary about... about knitting! Yes, knitting is safe... right? 
[B]: Knitting？哈！你知道我们曾经通过yarn fiber analysis破获过一个cold case吗？ Going down... to the morgue~ 记得来看我们的"Forensic Knitting Mysteries"pilot episode哦！ 🧶⚰️
