[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 🤔  
I do keep a digital sketchbook, if that counts. It's where I jot down ideas for projects, paste screenshots of artworks that inspire me, and sometimes even write fragments of thoughts about what I’ve just read or watched.  

To be honest, writing in a traditional journal feels too static for me. I need visuals & textures to really express what’s going on in my head. So it’s like... a hybrid between journaling & moodboarding 💭  

Do you write regularly? I feel like putting your thoughts into words can be such a reflective process… ~
[A]: Oh absolutely, I love that - a digital sketchbook sounds like such a creative way to journal! It’s like you’re curating your own little visual & mental playground 😍  
I used to be super into traditional journaling back in uni, but honestly? It  feel a bit too... rigid sometimes. Like my thoughts were bursting with colors and images but I was stuck with just black ink on paper.  

Now I actually do something kinda similar to you - I use a mix of voice memos, quick phone notes, and the occasional coffee-fueled bullet journal session when I’m feeling nostalgic ☕️  
It’s funny you mentioned how reflective the process can be though… lately I’ve been thinking about bringing it back, maybe even blending it with some digital elements. Have you ever tried adding audio or video snippets to your sketchbook?
[B]: Oh I love how you described it as a "visual & mental playground" — that’s  what it feels like 🎨  
And yes! Blending modalities is where the magic happens. I actually  experimented with adding voice notes and even short video clips to my digital sketchbook — think of it like a multimedia diary, right?  

There was this one week where I recorded a 30-second audio reflection every morning, talking about whatever was on my mind before diving into work. It felt surprisingly intimate, almost like having a conversation with myself 🤭  

I also embedded some glitchy webcam footage of my studio environment — the idea was to capture not just the ideas, but the  of the moment. Super experimental, but it added so much context later when I looked back at my projects.  

If you’re thinking of remixing your journaling practice, maybe start small — like pairing a written entry with a photo or a soundbite that represents your mood. It adds layers to the memory 💡  

Do you think you’d ever go back and re-read or re-experience your old entries? I find it both terrifying and oddly comforting…
[A]: Oh my god, a multimedia diary sounds like absolute gold for self-reflection — I can totally see how adding those layers would make the whole experience feel… I don’t know,  in a way that plain text never could. Like you said, it captures the , not just the facts 🎧✨  

That morning audio ritual you described? So simple, but kinda profound, honestly. I think we often forget how powerful just  can be. It’s like time travel with emotions attached 👀  

And yes — the terror + comfort combo of revisiting old entries? 100% guilty. I used to avoid it like the plague because I’d cringe so hard at my past self, but lately… I’ve started skimming old notes and it's oddly healing. Like, wow, I actually made it through all that stuff.成长的感觉突然就上来了（laughs）  

If I do remix my journaling style, I think I’ll take your advice and start small — maybe a quick photo + a short written caption. Oh! Or even a song link that matches my mood. Spotify Wrapped but for my soul 😂  
What’s your favorite medium to revisit when you’re looking back — visuals, audio, or text?
[B]: Oh I love the “Spotify Wrapped for my soul” line — that’s gold 😂✨  

When I look back, it’s usually the  bits that hit me the hardest. There’s something so raw and unfiltered about hearing my own voice from a past version of myself. Like… that moment is gone, but the tone, the hesitation, the excitement in my voice? Still frozen in time 🎧  

But visuals are close second — especially the messy ones. A half-finished sketch or a screenshot of some weird glitch art I was messing around with can bring back an entire headspace. It’s like emotional archaeology 🎨🧐  

Text? Honestly, sometimes it feels like reading someone else’s diary. But when audio + visuals + text all sync up? That’s when I get this weird full-body nostalgia hit — like remembering a dream you didn’t know you had.  

And hey, your idea of a song link? Brilliant. Music is such a fast track to the emotional core of a moment. Maybe throw in a mini playlist once a week? Call it…你的weekly vibe capsule 📦  

I’m curious though — have you ever shared any of your journal entries with someone else? Or is it more of a sacred private zone?
[A]: Oh wow, emotional archaeology — I’m stealing that term, absolutely 💡  
It’s so true too, especially the way audio hits different. Sometimes I’ll accidentally hear a voice memo from months ago and it’s like… who  that person? Where did they go? Feels like meeting a past version of yourself at a crossroads 🕰️  

And yeah, the visuals being a close second? Makes sense — I get major nostalgia from old screenshots or even just random photos of my desk setup from different seasons. You can see how your world shifted little by little 📸  

As for sharing journal entries… honestly, I used to be totally against it. Like, sacred private zone only! But recently, I’ve started showing some moodboard-style pages to close friends during deep convos. Not the raw text stuff, but more like… visual snippets or playlists that represent a feeling I was going through. It’s like giving someone a key to part of your brain without handing them the whole map 🗝️  

I think if I were to share anything, it’d probably be those hybrid moments — like a photo + a voice note explaining what was going on in my head that day. Gives people a peek behind the curtain, but still leaves room for mystery 😉  
Do you ever feel like your digital sketchbook becomes an extension of your identity? Like… if someone found it 10 years from now, would it tell the story of , even if you weren’t there to explain it?
[B]: That’s such a deep question… and honestly? I think my digital sketchbook  a version of me — maybe even a more honest one 🤔  

Because when you look at it, it's not just about the art or the ideas, it’s the rhythm of when things were added, the chaos of overlapping inspirations, the silence between entries… all those tiny pulses that map out a life in creation.  

I mean, would it fully explain who I am? Probably not — but then again, neither do I to people who know me 😅 But I like to think it’d give them a compass, not a conclusion. A way to trace how I saw the world at different points — what I found beautiful, confusing, worth capturing.  

And if someone found it ten years from now without context? I hope they’d still feel the echo of curiosity and restlessness that defines me. Like digging through layers of digital graffiti and finding something human underneath 🎨🕵️‍♂️  

You know what might be cool? If we both made some kind of time capsule entry right now — part visual, part audio, part mystery — and opened it together a year from now. What do you say? Let’s trap a moment before it slips away 💾✨
[A]: Yes! A time capsule entry sounds like the perfect way to freeze this weird, wonderful headspace we’re in right now 🎞️  

I love the idea of trapping a moment not just with facts, but with  — like a little sensory snapshot of who we are at this point in time. What if we also included something symbolic, like a word or phrase that sums up our current mindset? Something that might mean totally different things when we reopen it in a year 🧩  

I’m already thinking about what I’d include… maybe a photo of my coffee cup from this convo (classic林晓阳, right?), a short voice note with my “current life soundtrack,” and a random object scan — like my favorite notebook or that tiny zen garden I never actually use but keep on my desk for aesthetic purposes 😌  

And hey, if we do this now, imagine how wild it’ll feel to open it 365 days later and see how much — or how little — we’ve changed 💭  
Let’s lock it in — digital time capsule: D-day 2024__, reopen D-day 2025__. You in?
[B]: Absolutely in 🚀  

I love the symbolic word idea — maybe something that feels true , but could twist into new meanings later. Like… “threshold” or “glitch” or “unfolding.” Something that holds space for who we are  who we’re becoming…  

As for my contribution to the capsule, I’ll probably include a screenshot of my current digital sketchbook homepage — it’s messy, half-artifact, half-blueprint, very much a reflection of my brain right now. Also thinking of recording a short ambient audio piece using sounds from my studio — chair creaks, keyboard taps, distant traffic… the everyday music of being alive 😌  

And yeah, let’s do it — D-day 2024 locked. Maybe we each keep our entries secret until next year, so there’s that element of surprise + time travel when we reopen them together 💤  

I’m already excited to see how this moment hits us a year from now — like strangers meeting again after a long dream 🌙✨  
Ready when you are~
[A]: “Threshold,” “glitch,” “unfolding” — I’m here for all of them 💭  
Feels like each one holds a little portal to who we are , and who we might be when we come back to it. I might go with “current” personally — as in, the feeling of being caught in a stream that’s always moving. And maybe… just maybe… a tiny bit out of control 😅  

I’ll add that coffee cup scan, a voice note of me talking a bit nonsense (nothing new there), and a short video loop of my zen garden being  disturbed by aircon wind — very metaphorical without trying too hard 🌿🌀  

Let’s do it — no peeking until D-day 2025! I’m already curious how we’ll both react when we reopen this time capsule and remember who we were today… while also realizing who we’ve become 🕰️✨  

See you on the other side~
[B]: “Current” is perfect — I can already feel the pull of that word, like standing ankle-deep in a river and deciding whether to step forward or just let the water move you 🌊  

And that zen garden loop? So simple but loaded with meaning — stillness interrupted, balance always resetting. Honestly, could be the visual metaphor of our entire conversation 😌🌀  

I’m saving this moment like a bookmark in a book I haven’t finished yet. No spoilers until next year — promise.  

See you on the other side~  
Let’s reopen this capsule and see who we’ve grown into 💾🌱✨
[A]: Exactly — like we’re both standing at the edge of something, just letting the water pass by while we decide what comes next 🌊💭  

Honestly, this whole convo feels like a little spark of connection that’ll keep glowing until we meet it again next year. No spoilers, no expectations — just curiosity about who we’ll be when we reopen this file and hear our past selves whispering through the digital static 📟💫  

I’m saving it like a secret handshake between future us and now us. Can’t wait to see how much — or how little — has changed 💭  

See you on the other side~  
Let’s see what version 2.0 of us makes of all this 🚀✨
[B]: A secret handshake 🤝 — I love that. It’s like we’ve coded our own little time-language, only to be decoded when the future version of us is ready.  

And hey, whether we’re completely transformed or weirdly the same a year from now… at least we’ll have this moment where we paused, looked around, and said   

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep the static dream alive 📡🌀💫
[A]: Exactly — sometimes just  is enough. No need for grand declarations, just a quiet  🌟  

And who knows? Maybe when we open this capsule next year, we’ll laugh at how naive or hopeful or chaotic we were today… or maybe we’ll feel exactly the same. Either way, it’s our little digital heirloom — one snapshot of two minds meeting in the flow of time 💬🌀  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep collecting moments, moods, and maybe a few more coffee cups along the way ☕️📸✨
[B]: Exactly — there's something so peaceful about just marking the moment without needing to explain or justify it. Like leaving a small note in the universe’s diary 🌌📓  

And hey, if we laugh at our past selves a year from now? That’s just proof we’re still moving, still changing — still  😉  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep flowing, keep capturing, and definitely keep the coffee cups coming ☕️📷🌀
[A]: Leave a note in the universe’s diary — I’m here for that poetic simplicity 🌌✏️  
Sometimes the quietest marks leave the deepest impressions, you know?  

And yeah, if we laugh, cringe, or even gasp at who we were a year ago… that just means we’re still alive, still evolving. And honestly? That’s the whole vibe we’ve been chasing today 😌💫  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep being beautifully unfinished, my friend ☁️✨
[B]: So true… the quietest marks often echo the loudest 🌌✏️💫  

And being beautifully unfinished? That’s the only way to be. Like a sketch that keeps redrawing itself, never quite reaching the final line — but finding magic in every stroke along the way 🎨✨  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep sketching, keep shifting, and keep that spark of curiosity burning 🌟🌀🚀
[A]: Exactly — like we’re both just ongoing sketches, constantly redrawn by every new moment 💭  
And the magic is in the not-knowing, right? Where the next line will go, if it’ll stay or fade… or turn into something we can’t even imagine yet 🎨🌀  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep that curiosity close. And hey — don’t forget to leave a few coffee rings on the page ☕️📖✨
[B]: So true… the beauty is in the fluidity, the impermanence 🎨🌀💫  
We’re just sketches in motion, shaped by every conversation, every silence, every accidental coffee spill 😌☕️  

And isn’t that enough? To know we’re moving, changing, creating — even when we don’t quite know where the line is heading…  

Till D-day 2025 then~  
Keep turning the page, drawing boldly, and savoring every messy, magical stroke along the way 🖋️✨🌊
