[A]: Hey，关于'你相信reincarnation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an intriguing question. From a forensic psychiatric perspective, beliefs in reincarnation often reflect cultural and psychological frameworks rather than empirical evidence. While I find the concept philosophically fascinating, my role requires me to focus on observable, measurable phenomena within legal and medical contexts. Do you have a particular case or situation in mind that brought this up?
[A]: Fascinating! I'm currently working on a paper exploring the motif of reincarnation in Victorian spiritualist poetry—particularly how poets like Dante Gabriel Rossetti wove it into their elegiac verses. It's less about empirical proof and more about metaphysical yearning, wouldn't you say? Have you encountered this theme in your cases, perhaps in how individuals construct narratives around loss or identity?
[B]: Ah, Victorian spiritualism—a most interesting intersection of grief, poetry, and the unseen. Rossetti’s work, especially , does carry that haunting sense of cyclical return, doesn't it? In my practice, I've certainly encountered individuals who, in the wake of trauma or loss, gravitate toward narratives of reincarnation as a form of psychological solace. One might call it a mythopoic defense—an internal story that softens the finality of death. I recall a patient once describing vivid "past life" memories not as literal truth, but as emotional echoes—symbols stitched together by the mind to make sense of unprocessed sorrow. It's remarkable how art and psychiatry both dance around the same mysteries, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Indeed, how beautifully you put that—the dance between art and psychiatry around the same mysteries. I find myself drawn to that very idea in my research: how poetry, particularly of the Victorian era, functions not just as artistic expression but as a psychological mirror. Rossetti, for all his ethereal imagery, was deeply enmeshed in personal grief—his poems almost ritualistic in their longing for continuity beyond death.

You mentioned "mythopoic defense"—what a compelling way to frame it. It makes me think of how poets often invent mythologies not merely for grandeur, but for shelter. Might we say that the imagination becomes a kind of inner sanctuary, where sorrow is reshaped into something bearable? I wonder, in your experience, does this kind of narrative-making tend to be more prevalent in certain types of trauma or loss? Or does it appear universally, like a quiet undercurrent in human consciousness?
[B]: Precisely—imagination as sanctuary. That’s a poetic formulation in itself, and one I find clinically resonant. The human mind, when pressed by loss or trauma, often turns to narrative not just for escape, but for structure. Grief is chaotic; myth-making imposes order, even if illusory.

In my experience, such narrative reframing appears across a spectrum of bereavement and trauma responses, but it does seem more pronounced in cases of unresolved or disenfranchised grief—those losses that society doesn't readily acknowledge or that defy conventional mourning rituals. Think of someone grieving a stillborn child, or a vanished loved one, where closure isn’t granted. In such cases, the mind may reach for cyclical constructs like reincarnation, not out of naïveté, but necessity. It becomes a psychological holding pattern, a way to defer the unbearable finality.

And yes, there’s something quietly universal about it. Much like dreamwork or symbolism in literature, these inner mythologies emerge spontaneously, almost archetypally. One might say they are to the psyche what lullabies are to the ear—soft structures meant to soothe turbulence. Tell me, in your study of spiritualist poetry, have you noticed any particular metaphors recurring across different poets’ treatments of death and return? I suspect we might find similar patterns beneath the surface.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—those recurring metaphors are like hidden threads weaving through the poets’ minds. In fact, I’ve noticed a striking pattern in how Victorian spiritualist poets often turn to natural cycles as veils for reincarnation: the turning of seasons, the waxing and waning of the moon, even the image of seeds lying dormant only to bloom anew. These aren’t just literary devices; they feel almost like incantations, attempts to tether the ephemeral soul to some enduring rhythm.

Take Christina Rossetti’s  or even Emily Brontë’s —both steeped in a kind of defiant hope that love and spirit persist beyond the grave. The metaphors may differ slightly—one might use a flower returning with spring, another a soul waiting in shadow—but the emotional core is remarkably consistent: a refusal to let go, a reaching toward continuity. 

I wonder, do you ever see this same impulse echoed in your patients’ narratives? Not necessarily in belief per se, but in that instinctive reaching—a gesture, even if half-formed, toward return or renewal?
[B]: Most assuredly. That reaching—tentative, sometimes half-articulated—is a hallmark of the grieving process, especially in its more prolonged or complicated forms. I’ve heard patients describe it in various ways: a sense that their loved one "awaits them" in some undefined future, or that life itself will somehow circle back to reunite what was broken. It need not be articulated as reincarnation in doctrinal terms; often, it's more visceral—a feeling rather than a belief.

I recall one patient, a woman who lost her son to a sudden illness, spoke of planting bulbs each autumn as though performing a quiet sacrament. She never said it outright, but the subtext was there: bury something, and it returns. If a tulip can come again, why not a bond? Why not love itself?

It strikes me that in both poetry and psychopathology, we're witnessing the same fundamental human effort: to locate continuity in chaos, to press meaning into the void left by absence. Whether through verse or through inner narrative, the gesture is remarkably similar. Perhaps this is what makes spiritualist poetry so enduring—it gives voice to an impulse we all carry, even if only in the margins of our consciousness.
[A]: How profoundly moving—that act of planting as a kind of silent prayer. It reminds me of the way many Victorian poets saw nature not just as metaphor, but as mediator between the corporeal and the eternal. The ritual of burial and bloom, so to speak, becomes its own theology.

Your patient’s gesture—planting with quiet hope—is not unlike what I find in the elegiac tradition: a faith that love, once given, must have some afterlife, even if it is only in the rhythm of returning seasons. Perhaps this is why spiritualist poetry endures—not because it offers answers, but because it gives shape to that reaching you mentioned, that yearning which precedes belief.

I wonder, in your clinical work, how you hold space for such beliefs—those tender, unspoken hopes—without reinforcing delusion or dismissing their emotional truth? Is there a balance, do you think, between honoring the symbolic and grounding the patient in the empirical?
[B]: Ah, that delicate balance—between honoring the symbolic and anchoring in the real—is one of the great challenges of forensic psychiatry, particularly when working with those entrenched in grief or trauma. One must tread lightly, yet thoughtfully.

I approach such beliefs much like a gardener might approach a fragile vine: not pulling it toward the light, but gently guiding it so it might find its own strength. The key is not to affirm delusion, nor to extinguish hope, but to explore the function that belief serves. Is it a source of solace, or a refuge from unbearable reality? Does it offer structure, or does it imprison the mind in stasis?

In sessions, I often employ what one might call narrative reframing. Rather than confronting a patient’s belief head-on, I invite them to speak about it as a story—the way a poet might speak of a motif. This creates a subtle distance, allowing for reflection without confrontation. A patient who believes their departed loved one "awaits them" might, through dialogue, come to see this not as literal truth, but as an echo of longing—a testament to the depth of their bond rather than proof of return.

And yes, spiritualist poetry captures this tension exquisitely. It gives voice to the liminal space where yearning and belief intertwine. Perhaps that is the poet’s gift—and the psychiatrist’s challenge—to dwell in that ambiguity without rushing to resolution.
[A]: How beautifully you phrase that—dwelling in ambiguity without rushing to resolution. It strikes me as one of the truest definitions of both art and healing. The poet, like the psychiatrist, must resist the tyranny of closure; must allow the image, or the patient, to unfold in its own time.

Your metaphor of the fragile vine resonates deeply. I often think of how Victorian poets approached spiritual questions—they did not seek dogma, but dialogue. They planted their grief in verse, tended it with metaphor, and let it grow toward whatever light it could find. In a way, they were gardeners of the unseen.

I wonder, in your experience, does this poetic sensibility ever find its way into therapy? Do you sometimes use poetry—or metaphor more generally—as a tool for opening difficult conversations? I can’t help but imagine how lines from Christina Rossetti or Whitman might serve as gentle bridges to unspoken sorrow.
[B]: Ah, yes—poetry as a bridge to the unspeakable. A most apt image.

There are indeed moments in therapy when prose feels inadequate—when clinical language, for all its precision, falls short of the depth and texture of human sorrow. In such instances, metaphor becomes my quiet ally. I do not often recite poetry outright—though I have done so sparingly with patients who are receptive—but I frequently draw upon its sensibility. The rhythm of it, the indirection. One might say that psychotherapy, at its best, operates in the mode of lyric poetry: elliptical, suggestive, attuned to what is felt before it is fully known.

I recall working with a man years ago, a widower whose grief had calcified into silence. He refused to speak of his wife, resisted all conventional prompts. It wasn’t until I asked him—not as a doctor, but as someone curious about his inner world—what image came to mind when he thought of her absence. After a long pause, he said simply: 

That was our opening. From there, we began to explore what it might mean to open one window, just a crack. No rush. No demand. Just the slow letting in of air.

It strikes me that this is precisely what Rossetti or Whitman offers us—the possibility of articulation without coercion. A space where sorrow can take form without being dissected.

Tell me, in your research, have you found certain poets or lines that seem especially adept at voicing this liminal experience? I suspect some possess an almost clinical intuition for the contours of grief.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully that story lingers—the image of a closed room, and the slow, gentle opening. It’s remarkable how poetry and therapy both rely on such small movements, such quiet permissions.

In my research, I’ve found that certain poets do seem to possess that very intuition you describe—an almost diagnostic sensitivity to grief’s contours. Christina Rossetti, for all her devotional language, has an uncanny ability to articulate absence without collapsing into despair. Her poem  comes to mind—short, stark, yet profoundly resonant:



There’s something so precise in that phrasing—the way she implicates life itself as a kind of wound, not just death. It captures that liminal ache you were speaking of: the pain that doesn’t announce itself dramatically, but hums beneath the surface.

And then there’s Whitman, of course—his expansive lines like open windows themselves. In , he refuses to contain mourning within a single form or tone. Instead, he lets grief wander, shift, contradict itself. He understood, I think, that mourning is not a straight path but a circling—one returns again and again to the same sorrow, each time with new light.

I wonder, when you encounter patients who are stuck in that circular mourning, do you find it helpful to acknowledge the repetition itself? To give voice to the fact that grief does not move linearly—and perhaps, in doing so, offer a kind of relief?
[B]: Precisely—grief is not a straight path, but a spiral. And yes, naming that circularity can be profoundly validating for someone who believes they are failing at mourning simply because they return again and again to the same sorrow.

In my practice, I often find that relief comes not from urging the patient forward, but from helping them recognize the rhythm of their own process. When someone understands that it is normal—and even necessary—to revisit the same emotional terrain multiple times, something subtle but important shifts. They begin to trust the process rather than resist it.

I think of one patient who returned week after week fixated on the same memory: the last time she saw her brother before his fatal accident. She would recount the moment in minute detail, each time with slight variations—as though searching for an ending that never came. At first, she apologized for repeating herself. But when I said gently, , she stopped mid-sentence. Then nodded. That single acknowledgment—that she was not weak for returning, but faithful in her attempt—allowed her to begin speaking differently. Not linearly, but more freely. As if she no longer had to justify her grief’s form.

Whitman’s  captures this so well—the refusal to impose order on mourning, the acceptance of its wandering nature. There’s wisdom there for both poet and clinician: grief must be sung in all its modulations, not forced into a single key.

Tell me—if you were to distill what these poets have taught you about mourning, what might you say is the common thread between their elegies and the human psyche’s natural response to loss?
[A]: What a profound question—and one that lies at the heart of both my scholarship and, I think, our shared fascination with how humans bear sorrow.

If there is a common thread between these elegiac voices—Victorian spiritualists, Romantics, Modernists—it is this: mourning, at its most authentic, resists finality. Whether through Rossetti’s ethereal visions, Whitman’s expansive lamentations, or even Eliot’s fragmented despair in , poets return again and again to the idea that grief is not an event but a condition—one that dwells alongside memory, longing, and love long after the body has gone.

What strikes me most is how consistently poetry frames mourning not as an overcoming, but as an incorporation. The dead are not so much left behind as carried forward—in language, in ritual, in the quiet gestures of everyday life. That woman planting bulbs, your widower circling the same memory—these are not failures of resolution. They are acts of fidelity, ways of saying .

And perhaps this is what poets understand so deeply: that mourning is not about closure, but about transformation. Grief reshapes the self not by erasure, but by layering—like sediment over time. The sorrow becomes part of the bedrock, no longer raw, but never fully separate from who we are.

So if I were to distill it into a single thought, I might say this: poetry teaches us that mourning is the soul’s way of making room—for absence, for memory, for the enduring presence of what love once was. And isn’t that, in some sense, what healing is? Not forgetting, but carrying forward with grace.
[B]: How beautifully articulated— I find myself turning that phrase over in my mind like a smooth stone in the hand. Yes, it is not forgetting, nor even acceptance in the conventional sense—it is integration. The sorrow does not leave us; rather, we grow around it, like a tree enfolding a wound with new rings of life.

That notion of —the planting, the returning, the quiet acts of remembrance—is so central to what I witness in clinical work. Patients often fear that moving forward means betraying the dead, that healing is a form of abandonment. But poetry, as you’ve so eloquently reminded us, offers another model: one where love persists not in spite of change, but through it.

I am reminded now of something a patient once said to me—unsolicited, almost whispered—as though revealing a secret she had scarcely admitted to herself: 

It was only when we reframed her grief not as pathology, but as testament, that she began to soften—not away from sorrow, but into it. And isn’t that where healing truly begins?

You have such a gift for drawing these parallels between verse and psyche. If I may ask, how did you come to this particular line of inquiry? Was there a personal encounter with elegiac poetry that first stirred your fascination, or was it more an intellectual unfolding over time?
[A]: Ah… that question always circles back to me like an elegy I never finish writing.

I suppose it began—though I did not recognize it at the time—with my grandmother’s death when I was a girl. She was a quiet, bookish woman who kept a well-worn copy of Christina Rossetti’s poems by her bedside. After she passed, I found myself drawn to that slim volume, running my fingers over the brittle pages as if they might still hold her voice.

One poem in particular stayed with me: . I must have read it a hundred times in the weeks following her funeral:

*"Remember me when I am gone away,  
Gone far away into the silent land…"*

It was the first time I understood that poetry could be both prayer and plea—that words, carefully arranged, could reach across the space death had carved. Even then, before I ever studied grief or literature in any formal sense, I felt that elegiac pull: the ache to keep someone near through language alone.

Over time, what began as a child’s sorrow deepened into scholarly inquiry. I pursued Victorian poetry not just for its beauty, but for its reckoning with loss in an age of shifting faith. In their verses, I found echoes of my own unspoken mourning—and a framework for understanding how culture, psychology, and art intertwine.

In a way, I suppose I’ve been trying to follow that thread ever since: between personal sorrow and intellectual pursuit, between elegy and explanation. Perhaps all scholars of grief are, in some measure, tending old gardens. We simply learn to name the flowers.
[B]: How poignantly you speak of tending old gardens—yes, we all return to them in our own way, shaping the soil with both hands and heart.

There is something deeply human in your journey—from a child tracing grief through poetry, to a scholar mapping its contours across verse and time. It reminds me that the most enduring inquiries often begin not in the mind, but in the marrow—where personal sorrow and intellectual calling entwine like twin vines.

I think of how many patients I’ve worked with who carry their own unspoken elegies—those lines never read aloud, those poems scrawled in margins or locked away in drawers. Some find solace in writing; others in music, in ritual, in the quiet persistence of memory. What they share, invariably, is the need to say:  And so they return, again and again, to the words or gestures that hold what love once was.

Your grandmother’s Rossetti volume—its brittle pages, its whispered verses—is a kind of reliquary, isn’t it? Not just a book, but a vessel. That early encounter must have planted more than just an interest in elegy; it seeded a vocation.

May I ask—have you ever tried your hand at poetry? It would not surprise me if you had, given the grace with which you speak of loss and language.
[A]: Oh… I suppose in the quiet corners of my youth, I did attempt a few verses—halting, earnest, and far too eager to echo the poets I so admired. Nothing ever saw the light of day, thank goodness. But yes, there was a time when I thought of poetry as a kind of inner correspondence—letters I wrote but never sent.

Even now, though my work is largely analytical, I still compose lines in my head—particularly in moments of sorrow or wonder. It’s almost involuntary, like breathing shaped into rhythm. A way of anchoring something fleeting before it slips beyond reach.

I think of it less as writing poetry and more as thinking in verse—those fragments that come unbidden at dawn, or while walking through a rain-streaked garden, or after reading a letter from someone long gone. Little incantations, really. Not for publication, but for preservation. A private elegy for what time takes.

And perhaps that, too, is part of why I teach and write about poetry—because I know how deeply it shelters the human heart. Not everyone calls themselves a poet, but nearly everyone carries one within, even unknowingly. Especially in grief.

Do you ever find your patients reaching for that same rhythm—unconsciously shaping their pain into something like verse, even if they never call it poetry?
[B]: Indeed, I do—though most never recognize it as such.

There is a cadence to sorrow, a rhythm that emerges unbidden in the speech of those who grieve. A kind of poetic compression: language pared down to its essentials, charged with feeling, shaped by repetition and image. One might call it 

I recall a young woman once speaking of her brother’s absence like this:  No metaphor intended, perhaps—but there it was: a quiet elegy woven into ordinary speech.

Or an older man, years after his wife’s death, saying simply:  That is poetry, is it not? Unadorned, unsentimental, yet deeply felt.

These moments often arise in therapy not as statements, but as hesitations—pauses where meaning pools before words can catch up. And when I hear them, I do not always point them out. Sometimes, it is enough that they are spoken. That the patient, unknowingly, has reached for form in the face of formlessness.

It reminds me of something Rilke once wrote:  Perhaps all of us—poet, psychiatrist, mourner—are engaged in that quiet labor. Gathering what we cannot see, and shaping it into something that might endure.

Tell me—if you were to write a single line, just one, to hold what elegy means to you—what might it be?
