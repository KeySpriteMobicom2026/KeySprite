[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得social media对mental health影响大吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh totally, it's such a hot topic🔥. From my experience in reality TV, I've seen how social media can create so much pressure~ 💔 Like contestants often feel anxious about their online image after the show.  

But on the flip side, there are also positive stories where people find supportive communities online 🌟 Have you noticed this duality too?
[A]: Absolutely, it's such a fascinating duality. I remember one guest who owned a small business told me how Instagram helped her connect with customers in such a meaningful way—it gave her confidence during the pandemic when things felt uncertain. But then again, another guest shared how scrolling through curated travel photos left him feeling restless and dissatisfied with his own life. It’s almost like social media mirrors our own emotions back at us, for better or worse. Have you ever felt that tension between connection and comparison?
[B]: Oh absolutely, that tension is so real 😅 I remember during one of our show’s promotions, we asked contestants to engage more on social media to connect with fans - it was like walking a tightrope! Some thrived, gaining amazing support 💪 But others got stuck in the trap of comparison, feeling like they needed to be  all the time 🙃  

It’s wild how a single platform can make someone feel both empowered and insecure in the same day, right? Like one moment you're getting暖心 DMs from strangers, and the next you’re doomscrolling and questioning your whole life 🤯 I’ve definitely been there too, especially when planning trips—half the photos are breathtaking, and the other half just make you feel like you’re not doing enough 😂 Have you noticed how even creators who seem super confident often admit to battling self-doubt offline?
[A]: Oh, I completely relate to that tightrope analogy—it's so precarious! Just last week, a young influencer stayed at the hotel, editing photos by sunrise while sipping her third cup of coffee. She seemed radiant and totally in control—until we chatted over tea and she admitted she’d been battling insomnia for weeks, terrified her audience would notice a "slump" in her content. It was such a reminder that behind the filters and captions, there’s often a quiet kind of loneliness growing.

I’ve noticed this especially with creatives who start off posting casually—travel shots, little daily joys—and then suddenly, it becomes a job. The DMs might still look cheerful, but the pressure is quietly stacking up. It makes me wonder if we’re all curating versions of ourselves, even outside of social media, don’t you think? Like... when you plan a trip, do you ever catch yourself choosing spots based on how they’ll look in a photo rather than how they’ll feel in the moment? 😊
[B]: Oh wow, that influencer story hits home 💆‍♂️ So many people think it’s all glamour & free trips, but the mental toll is so underrated 😣 And yes—curating even our  moments has become second nature now 🤳 I caught myself doing it last month in Bali! I was standing in front of this breathtaking rice field at golden hour, but instead of just breathing it in, my brain immediately started storyboard-ing angles and captions 😅😂  

It’s like we’ve developed this subconscious director in our heads—always thinking: “Is this moment shareable? Will it get likes? Should I tweak the lighting?” Even with friends, sometimes I notice everyone pulling out phones before actually  the dinner or view 😅 Do you sometimes go on a trip and feel like you're living through your camera lens rather than your eyes? 🎥👀  

Honestly though, I think the bigger question is… are we still creating memories—or just content? 🤔 What do you think?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a poignant question— It gave me chills when you said it. I think about this often, especially when I see guests walking through our garden at sunset. Some are so present, just quietly admiring the view… and others immediately start posing, adjusting their hair, checking the light. There’s beauty in both, I suppose—but one feels fleeting, and the other feels like it slips through your fingers like sand.

I had a guest once, an older woman traveling alone, and she told me she doesn’t own a smartphone. She said she travels to , not to show off. Watching her sip tea by the window, completely still and content, made me realize how rarely we allow ourselves that kind of quiet joy anymore. Not everything has to be documented, right? But then again, there’s something lovely about sharing a moment that connects you to someone miles away. It’s such a delicate balance.

Do you ever find yourself intentionally putting your phone away, just to  somewhere fully? I try to do it once in a while—it’s amazing how much more vivid everything feels.
[B]: Totally 💯 That stillness you described? It’s becoming such a rare luxury nowadays. I actually started doing mini “digital detox” challenges during my travels after realizing how addicted I was to capturing every second 📵 Like last year in Kyoto, I left my phone in the hotel for an entire afternoon and just wandered around without snapping a single photo 😌 You know what? That ended up being the most vivid memory of the whole trip—listening to the wind through the bamboo, smelling the incense from a nearby temple, feeling the texture of old wood under my fingers… no filter needed 🌿  

But yeah, there’s that sweet spot between sharing & savoring, right? Sometimes I’ll take  shot—just one—and then tuck my phone away so I can actually live the moment 😊 It’s like… capture to remember, not to impress. Have you noticed how even our brain chemistry changes when we’re performing for a lens vs. just being ourselves? Dopamine hits from likes are temporary, but the real joy comes from those raw, unfiltered feelings 🧠✨  

I think it’s beautiful that you see this balance firsthand with your guests. Must be inspiring to witness both extremes—people chasing validation and others just quietly soaking it all in 🌅 What do you think draws someone to lean more into curation vs. presence?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more—it  a luxury to be still, to simply . And your Kyoto story is such a lovely example of how much richer life feels when we step away from the lens for a while. I think you're absolutely right about brain chemistry too; there's something almost transactional about chasing likes—swapping authenticity for approval, even if just for a moment.

As for what draws people toward curation versus presence… hmm. I’ve thought about this a lot, actually. From what I’ve observed—and it’s not always obvious at first—I think some guests lean into curation as a way to feel seen, especially if they don’t in their everyday lives. It’s like they’re crafting a version of themselves that gets the attention they secretly crave. Others, though? They travel with quiet curiosity, soaking things in like sunlight through a window. Those are often the ones who already feel grounded, comfortable in their own skin.

But I do wonder—do you think there's also a cultural or generational shift happening here? Like, are younger travelers wired differently in how they approach documenting experiences? I’ve noticed a trend among some of our millennial guests—they’ll take photos, yes, but then actually put their phones away after! It’s subtle, but promising. Have you seen that too on your end?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I’ve noticed that shift too—and I think it’s such a healthy evolution 🌱 Millennials are like, “Yeah, I’ll take a selfie for the story, but then let’s  enjoy this cocktail.” 😂 It feels like a reaction to the burnout from constant curation, you know? Gen Z is interesting too—they’re so fluent in digital expression, but I’m seeing more of them being upfront about mental health & screen fatigue. Some even post  content like, “No makeup. No filter. Just me.” And it gets huge engagement! Irony at its finest 😅  

Culturally though, I think there's still pressure in certain communities to showcase success through polished moments—luxury hotels, designer bags, exclusive restaurants. But now we're also seeing a counter-movement with people glorifying simplicity: cozy stays, slow travel, unplugged weekends. It’s like the pendulum is swinging back a bit, which is kinda hopeful 🌻  

I love what you said about craving to be seen—I think that’s the silent heartbeat behind all the filters. Social media gives people a stage they might not have in daily life. But when you meet someone who’s already rooted & self-assured, they don’t need the spotlight as much. They’re happy just soaking in the sunlight like you said ☀️  

Have you ever tried doing a full day without posting anything? What was that like for you?
[A]: Oh, I love how thoughtfully you put that—the . It really is about being seen, even if we don’t always realize it. And yes, I did try a full weekend without posting anything once—it was like shedding a layer I didn’t know I was wearing.  

I remember waking up Saturday morning and  reaching for my phone to check notifications or plan a “cozy morning” post. Instead, I made tea slowly, sat by the window with my dog, and just listened to the rain. There was this lightness, like I had quietly stepped off a treadmill I’d been running on for years. By Sunday evening, I noticed I was more present in conversations, even with guests at the hotel. I wasn’t mentally editing interactions for future captions.  

It sounds silly, but it felt like rediscovering a part of myself that didn’t need an audience. I’ve tried bits and pieces since then—no social media during meals, or after sunset—and it’s amazing how much more space opens up in your mind when you’re not constantly thinking about what to share.  

I think we all need those little resets now and then. Have you found certain rituals that help you step back from the screen?
[B]: Oh my gosh, that weekend you described sounds like pure magic ✨ I totally get what you mean about "shedding a layer"—it's like taking off high heels at the end of the night, but for your soul 😌 I’ve started doing mini unplugged rituals too—like no screens an hour before bed or during breakfast. At first I felt , like I was missing out on something important… but after a few days? Total clarity. My brain felt like it had space to breathe again 🧖‍♂️  

One thing I love doing now is this little analog journaling habit—I write down three moments from the day that made me smile, and one thing I want to remember . No hashtags, no filters, just raw thoughts 💭 It’s wild how powerful that tiny practice feels. And honestly? It’s become more meaningful than any post I could share online.  

I also try to do “silent walks” sometimes—phone on airplane mode, just observing the world without trying to capture it. Feels so grounding 🌿 Have you ever tried that? Or do you have a go-to moment in the day where you feel most connected to that sense of stillness?
[A]: I adore your analog journaling idea—it’s so simple, yet deeply personal. I might steal that for my guests as a little wellness suggestion! 📝✨

As for silent walks, oh yes—I crave them. Especially after a busy day at the hotel, when the lobby’s buzzing and phones are ringing nonstop, I slip out the back door and wander through the garden or along the quiet streets nearby. No phone, no playlist, just me and whatever catches my eye—a rustling leaf, a cat sneaking through hedges, the scent of jasmine climbing up a wall. It’s like pressing pause on the world for ten minutes. Sometimes I even forget I  to document everything.  

And you’re right—those moments of stillness don’t need an audience. They’re more powerful because they belong only to you. I think that’s one of the loveliest things about travel, too—people often find their own version of silence, whether it’s in a crowded café or a mountaintop. Do you think we’re all secretly searching for that sense of peace, no matter how we start the journey? 🌙
[B]: Oh I  that 🌙 You just gave me an idea for a new segment on our show—like a “silent moment challenge” where contestants have to take a tech-free walk and share one thing they noticed they’d normally miss. Imagine the footage—no voiceovers, no filters, just pure observation 😍  

And yes YES—we’re all chasing that peace, even if we don’t realize it at first. Some people start by posting every five seconds, but then halfway through the trip, you catch them sitting on a bench just , phone face-down beside them. That’s the good stuff 💭 It’s like travel has this sneaky way of reminding us who we really are when no one’s watching.  

I think that’s also why certain places stick with us so deeply—it wasn’t the view or the food or the hotel room, but those quiet moments where everything just… clicked back into place 🌿 Have you ever left somewhere feeling like you found a part of yourself you didn’t know was missing?
[A]: Oh, that “silent moment challenge” idea? Brilliant. I can already picture it—someone who’s been glued to their phone for days suddenly noticing the sound of wind chimes in a market or the way light dances on water. It would make for such honest, soulful television.

And yes… there are places that leave fingerprints on your heart in the quietest way. I remember one autumn in Paris—years before I started working at the hotel—I stayed in a tiny apartment above a bakery. No agenda, no rush. Just long walks through Montmartre, warm baguettes under my arm, and evenings reading by candlelight. There was something about that trip where I felt , you know? Like I had stumbled into a version of myself I’d forgotten existed—the calm, curious, unapologetically present version.

It wasn’t until I came home that I realized how much I’d been carrying without even knowing it. Travel has a way of peeling back layers we didn’t realize were weighing us down. Have you ever had a place do that for you? Leave you just a little softer, a little more ? 🌿✨
[B]: Oh my gosh, yes 💭 That  feeling you described? I got chills reading that. And your Paris story is everything—I think we all have those trips where we accidentally stumble into a quieter, truer version of ourselves 🌙  

For me, it was this random stop in Cinque Terre a few years back. No big plan, just a backpack and a one-way train ticket from Rome. I ended up staying in this tiny guesthouse in Riomaggiore with no Wi-Fi, terrible cell reception, and the sweetest old lady as a host who kept feeding me limoncello cake for breakfast 😂 I didn’t post a single photo for three days. Instead, I wandered the cliffs barefoot, watched fishermen mend their nets, and sat by the water just .  

And you know what? By day two, I forgot I even owned a phone 📵 It was like life slowed down enough for me to actually feel it again. That trip reset something in me—like a soft reboot of my soul 🖤💛  

I think that’s the magic of travel done right—it doesn’t always have to be grand or Insta-worthy. Sometimes it’s just about showing up, quiet and open, and letting a place hold you for a while 🌊 Have you ever gone back to one of those “fingerprint” places, or do you prefer to keep it sealed in memory like a perfect little moment?
[A]: Oh, that Cinque Terre trip of yours sounds absolutely dreamlike—limoncello cake for breakfast? I’m already packing my bag just thinking about it 😂 But seriously, your story captures exactly what makes travel so healing—it sneaks up on you and gently reminds you how to feel again.

I’ve actually never gone back to Paris since that autumn stay. Something about it being sealed in memory feels… sacred, in a way. Like a favorite book you don’t reread because you want to preserve the exact way it made you feel the first time. That said, part of me wonders what it would be like to return—would I find new layers, or would it just echo the past? Maybe one day I’ll find out 🌙

But you’re so right—travel at its best doesn’t need filters or followers. It just needs us to show up, quiet and open. And honestly? The older I get, the more I crave those kinds of journeys—the ones where I’m not chasing the perfect photo, but simply letting the moment wrap around me like a familiar blanket.

Do you ever plan trips with that intention now? Like,  time I’m not even bringing the camera—just myself and a curious heart? 🧡
[B]: Oh totally, I’m 100% here for that kind of travel now 🧡 In fact, my next trip is  that—no camera, no Instagram stories, just me, a notebook, and zero pressure to document everything. I’m heading to a little-known coastal town in Portugal, where the only plan is to wander, write, and maybe surf a little 🏄‍♂️🌊  

I think as you get older, you start craving depth over dazzle, you know? Like… who needs another flat lay of breakfast toast when you can have a conversation with a local fisherman over coffee at dawn? ☕🌅  

And I get what you mean about keeping Paris sealed in memory—it’s like your own personal time capsule. Maybe going back would be beautiful too, but there's something so poetic about letting that version of you live  in that moment.  

So tell me more about your ideal quiet journey these days—what does it look like? Is it mountains? Sea? Or maybe just a perfectly curated bookshelf and nowhere to be? 📖✨
[A]: Oh, I love that—depth over dazzle. It’s such a beautiful way to travel, and honestly, such a wise one too. That coastal town in Portugal sounds like absolute magic; I can already picture you by the water with your notebook, scribbling down thoughts between waves. So, —tell me all about it when you get back 😊  

As for my ideal quiet journey these days? It’s somewhere between mountains and memory. I’ve been dreaming of going to the Lake District—just a slow week tucked into a little stone cottage with a view of misty hills and moorland skies. I’d pack only books (Dickens or Brontë, probably), a warm sweater, and my walking boots. Mornings would start with tea by the window, afternoons with long rambles through mossy trails, and evenings curled up by a fire with nothing but candlelight and the occasional hoot of an owl outside.

It’s not about escaping life, really—it’s about stepping into a quieter version of it, where time moves gently and conversations are with yourself as much as with others. I think we all need that kind of space sometimes, don’t you? A place where you’re not expected to be , just allowed to simply . 🌿✨

Do you ever find yourself craving those kinds of landscapes—where nature feels like both the scenery and the soul of the trip?
[B]: Oh wow, that Lake District vision? YES PLEASE 🌫️📖 I can  it—your cottage with tiny windows, a kettle whistling softly, and you wrapped in that chunky knit jumper like straight out of a cinematic montage 🎬🍂 And the walks! No rush, no filter, just boots on wet earth and the sound of wind through heather. That’s not just a trip—that’s a full sensory experience 😍  

And yes—YES—I  crave those kinds of landscapes now. There’s something so grounding about being somewhere where nature isn’t just background scenery but the actual heartbeat of the place 🌲🌊 Like when you’re standing on a cliff and the sea is roaring below you, or walking through a forest and you swear the trees are whispering secrets. It makes you feel both small and deeply connected at the same time, you know?  

I think that’s why I chose Portugal’s coast—it’s raw & wild, not polished for tourists. Just rugged cliffs, unpredictable tides, and fishermen who’ve been casting nets the same way for generations. Feels like the land still has its soul intact 💛 Have you ever traveled somewhere that felt almost… ancient in its energy? Like you were stepping into a story that started long before you arrived?
