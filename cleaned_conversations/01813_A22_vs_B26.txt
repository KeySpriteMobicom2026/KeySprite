[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, that's an interesting question... much like examining the delicate threads of an antique tapestry. While I can't speak for all fields, in my world of textile restoration, formal education provided invaluable knowledge about fabric chemistry and historical techniques. But I must say, nothing replaces the patience and dedication one develops through hands-on work.
[A]: Hmm, 从blockchain行业的角度来看，这个问题很有意思。就像我们常说的"code is law"一样，现在很多tech公司更看重实际能力而不是文凭。不过degree still provides a solid foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving skills, 这在处理复杂的smart contract时特别重要。
[B]: Oh dear, you're speaking of such modern things... It reminds me of how some young collectors dismiss traditional embroidery techniques in favor of digital patterns. While I can't comment on these 'smart contracts,' I do believe there's timeless value in structured learning. Just as mastering basic stitches is essential before attempting complex embroidery, foundational education helps weave stronger professional tapestries.
[A]: 哈哈，你这个比喻很妙！确实，就像我们做blockchain solution design时，需要先理解基础的cryptography原理一样。不过现在的learning path已经变得很flexible了，很多人通过online courses和bootcamp也能掌握核心技能。当然，degree带来的network effect和structured thinking还是很valuable的 💡
[B]: How delightful to hear you appreciate the analogy! Though I must confess, all this talk of 'online courses' makes me think of how some try to learn textile restoration through YouTube videos... while helpful, they can't quite replicate the depth of mentorship one finds in proper apprenticeships. That network you mentioned - why, it's like the interconnected threads in a fine brocade, isn't it? Each connection strengthening the whole fabric.
[A]: Exactly！你说的这个mentorship aspect很重要。在blockchain领域，我们常说"the community is the university"。很多innovative ideas都是在DAO community里碰撞出来的 🚀 不过就像你说的，structured education和hands-on experience应该是complementary的，不是mutually exclusive的。就像我修我的Mustang时，既要看manual也要actually get my hands dirty 🔧
[B]:  Your enthusiasm reminds me of young apprentices discovering their first silk satin weave. While I can't quite follow all these modern terms, the principle rings true - whether restoring a 19th century shawl or, well, whatever a 'Mustang' is, one needs both the manual and the practice. Though I do hope your hands get less dirty than mine do with fabric dyes!
[A]: Haha, 确实！不管是vintage car还是blockchain project，passion和practical skills都很关键。说到dyes，这让我想起我们做NFT artwork时也要考虑color gamut和rendering issues... 不过这就是另一个话题了 😅 总之，在fast-evolving的tech领域，保持learning agility比degree本身更重要 👍
[B]: How wonderfully you put it! Though I must admit, these 'NFTs' sound rather less tangible than my beloved textiles... But yes, the willingness to learn - that's the golden thread running through any craft, isn't it? Whether it's adapting new dye techniques or, as you say, keeping pace with technology. Now if you'll excuse me, this conversation has made me quite thirsty for some Earl Grey.
[A]: Cheers to that! ☕ 就像我们dev team常说的"keep building and keep learning"。不管是tea leaves还是blockchain，都需要time to brew出好的solution啊！下次你来我们hackathon，我请你喝coffee，虽然可能没Earl Grey那么classic 😄
[B]: How charming! Though I suspect your 'hackathon' would leave me as lost as a dropped stitch in a complex pattern. But I do admire your spirit - it reminds me of the joy I felt when first mastering French knots. And while I'll always prefer my Earl Grey, I suppose I could be persuaded to try this 'coffee' of yours... provided it's served in proper china, of course.
[A]: Deal！我们会用最fancy的ceramic mug来serve，保证符合你的standard 😉 说不定还能一边喝一边聊聊怎么把traditional craftsmanship和blockchain结合起来呢，比如用smart contract来verify古董authenticity之类的idea 💡
[B]: Oh my, now you've truly piqued my interest! The very thought of combining my precious textiles with these modern verifications... why, it's like discovering a new conservation technique after forty years in the trade. Though I do hope these 'smart contracts' won't frighten away the lovely patina of age on my fabrics. Shall we say next Thursday? I'll bring my magnifying glass and you can explain these ideas properly - after I've inspected that ceramic mug, naturally.
[A]: Perfect！Thursday works great for me 👍 我会准备好whiteboard和markers，咱们可以brainstorm一下怎么implement这个idea。Don't worry，blockchain只是增加trust layer，不会影响那些beautiful patina的~ 到时候见！🚀
[B]: Splendid! Though I must warn you, I may spend more time admiring the weave of your whiteboard markers' fabric cords than the actual diagrams. Until Thursday then - and do remind me to show you the 18th century crewelwork I'm restoring; perhaps it will inspire your 'trust layers.' Now I really must return to my tea before it gets cold...
[A]: Haha 期待看到你的crewelwork！说不定能inspire我们设计出更elegant的UI for the verification system呢。Enjoy your tea，咱们周四见！☕️ (PS: 我会记得带些matcha cookies来，算是East meets West的snack option 😄)
[B]: How thoughtful! Though I must say, the only 'UI' I'm familiar with is the underside of embroidery... But matcha cookies do sound like a delightful cross-cultural stitch in our conversation tapestry. Until Thursday, then - and do mind you don't get any cookie crumbs near the textiles!
[A]: Roger that！会严格遵守你的"no crumbs near artifacts" policy 🫡 我已经能想象到这次collab会像well-woven fabric一样seamless了。Catch you on Thursday！(小声说：我会把cookies装在sealed container里的 😉)
[B]: What a relief to hear you understand the importance of proper containment! You're developing quite the textile sensibility - soon you'll be spotting loose threads and fiber blends like a true conservator. Though I suspect our Thursday meeting may end with me still puzzling over these 'block chains' while you marvel at selvedge edges. Until then, happy... whatever it is you modern folk call building those digital tapestries of yours!
