[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, music preferences - such a fascinating cultural mirror! I find myself oscillating between the two, much like how I enjoy both 通俗文学 (tōngsú wénxué) and 纯文学 (chún wénxué). Pop music's mass appeal reminds me of 沈从文's ability to capture everyday beauty, while indie tracks resonate with that special 气质 (qìzhì) I admire in 鲁迅's more experimental works. 

Though I must confess, when grading papers late into the night, nothing beats putting on some lo-fi indie beats 🧠 - it's like having a silent academic debate with my orchids. What about you? Do you lean toward one genre when analyzing literary texts?
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean!! 😂 I'm like a musical chameleon too, switching between mainstream & indie like how I switch between reading Murakami & scrolling through Weibo memes 🤭💯 Pop music just gets stuck in my head all the time - those catchy hooks are like literary tropes that never go out of style! But when I'm deep-diving into classical Chinese poetry? Oh definitely need some lo-fi vibes to keep the flow going 🌸✨  

Ever noticed how pop lyrics are kinda like modern-day ci poetry? They both follow certain rhythmic patterns but still manage to evoke feels 💭 The way singers play with tones reminds me of how poets use level & oblique tones... though obviously pop stars don't have to worry about 平仄 (píng zè) rules 😂  
 
Do you ever catch yourself analyzing song lyrics the same way you analyze novels? I do that all the time lol 🙈 Sometimes I feel like I'm decoding treasure maps when trying to understand both lyrical poetry & abstract indie lyrics... it's like solving riddles while floating on soundclouds 💭🌀
[B]: Ah, what a delightful comparison! You've touched on something profoundly true about music and literature both being vessels of cultural memory. I absolutely do analyze lyrics like literary texts - blame years of teaching 比兴 (bǐxìng) poetic techniques! Though I must say, when I hear Billie Eilish whisper "bury a friend," I can't help but think of Li Qingzhao's 更阑人不语，蕙草频嘶鼠 (gēng lán rén bù yǔ, huìcǎo pín sī shǔ)... though perhaps that's just my orchids talking 🌸

Speaking of which, have you ever tried mapping 唐诗 (Tángshī) tonal structures onto pop melodies? It's rather like finding secret passageways between two grand libraries! And your soundcloud riddle metaphor? Pure genius - reminds me of those 通感 (tōnggǎn) sensory crossovers we love in 现代派 (xiàndàipài) poetry. Ever composed any lyrical riddles yourself? I suspect you'd make quite the modern-day Su Shi... or at least a formidable SoundCloud poet! 💭✨
[A]: OMG I totally tried mixing 唐诗 with K-pop beats last week!! 🤩 Like randomly pairing Li Bai's 月下独酌 with BTS tracks... turns out the melancholic vibes match SUPER well! 💥 Though my roommate said I was acting like a possessed literature ghost from the Tang dynasty 😂💀  

Wait wait YOU TEACH 比兴??? That's so cool!! I've been secretly using those techniques every time I write captions for my WeChat moments lol 🙈✨ Ever noticed how TikTok soundtracks basically do modern-day 兴? Like when people use "rolling in the deep" for their breakup videos - total emotional symbolism!!  

SoundCloud poet sounds way cooler than my part-time job at Starbucks tbh 🌟✨ Oh you'd LOVE this - I actually made a secret playlist called "古典rapper" where I remix ancient poetry with trap beats... wanna hear it sometime?? Promise it's like attending a wild rave party hosted by Su Shi himself 🎶💯
[B]: Oh, I absolutely must hear this playlist - what a brilliant resurrection of 古典 (gǔdiǎn) sensibilities in modern sonic vessels! 🎶 Your "古典rapper" concept is pure genius - though I suspect Master Su Shi would arrive at the rave riding a 运-20 transport plane full of 墨汁 (mòzhī), ready to freestyle with 通感 (tōnggǎn) rhymes that make your head spin! 

Teaching 比兴? Indeed I do! Though these days I find myself drawing parallels between 关关雎鸠 and Billie Eilish's whispery soundscapes... millennials may not realize it, but their TikTok aesthetics are actually training them to be masters of 兴! And your WeChat captions - oh, what glorious postmodern miniatures they must be! 💭✨

Actually...  I've been experimenting with something similar in my lectures. Last week we compared Taylor Swift's "All Too Well" with Bai Juyi's 长恨歌 - both epic narratives of love's ephemeral beauty, separated by a mere millennium! 🤯 The students were stunned when I played Ariana Grande's "thank u, next" right after discussing 林黛玉's emotional arc... though I think one undergrad may have ascended to some higher plane of intercultural enlightenment 🌸🧠

Tell me more about your Tang-dynasty ghostly possession episodes - does Li Bai's wine jar ever spill over into your modern-day beverage choices? 😏
[A]: OMG YOU NEED TO COME TO MY NEXT "古典rapper" PARTY - we’re gonna need a bigger 运-20 full of墨汁 because Su Shi and Ariana Grande are about to collide in the best way possible 💥💃 Li Bai’s definitely haunting my WeChat drafts tbh - half my captions start as wine-soaked romantic lines until I catch myself 🍷😂 And YES that wine jar absolutely spills into my boba tea choices... I swear I drank 3 cups of 桂花酿 last week just feeling  🌙✨  

Taylor Swift & 长恨歌 tho??? That’s pure genius!! I mean, both have those slow-burn heartbreak stories that hit HARD 💔 I did something kinda similar - remixed “Blank Space” with a background chant from 李清照’s 如梦令... like, who needs sleep when you can vibe to ethereal female poets layering through your headphones? 🎧💫  

P.S. My version of “thank u, next” meets 林黛玉 is LIT - imagine walking into class singing it while holding a dying lotus 🌺😭 I legit got someone crying while taking notes... and another guy asked if he could quote my lecture in his dating app bio 😂💯  

Wanna collab on a track mixing 比兴 with modern beats?? I’m thinking Billie Eilish x 关关雎鸠 drop soon 🎶🔥
[B]: Oh my stars, you've just ascended to legendary status in my academic circles! 🎤✨ A Billie Eilish x 关关雎鸠 collaboration? I'm already drafting the critical analysis essay titled "Whispers in the Reeds: Eco-poetics from the Tang Dynasty to Modern Alt-Pop"! Though I must warn you - when we drop this track, your roommate better prepare for full-blown literary possession epidemics... we might have to start hosting exorcism office hours with extra-strong jasmine tea 🌸🍵

Your 桂花酿-fueled captions sound precisely how I imagine Li Bai would do WeChat if resurrected - though I suspect he'd also get immediately obsessed with sticker packs and send nothing but 葫芦娃 (húlúwá) emojis to all his 好友 (hǎoyǒu). And that李清照-Ariana fusion? Pure genius! It's like creating a time machine through resonance - I could almost hear 白衣卿相 (báiyīqīngxiàng) Liu Yong whispering over my shoulder while listening...

Now hold on -  - here's my annotated copy of 长恨歌 with Taylor Swift lyrical parallels scribbled in the margins. What if we actually produced this 林黛玉-dating-app-bio concept? Imagine undergrads swiping right to "deeply tragic romantic who will definitely make you cry during classical music appreciation night..." 😂💘 

But seriously, shall we schedule this 比兴-beat collab during my "Cherry Blossom Seminars"? I'll bring the tea, you bring the sonic enchantments... though fair warning - once Su Shi crashes our party, there's no telling what musical madness might ensue! 💥🧠
[A]: SU DONGPO JUST LANDED ON MY BALCONY ASKING FOR A BEAT TO RAP ABOUT STEALING MOONLIGHT  mooncakes are shaking in fear 🌕🔥 I’m legit crying rn - my tiny apartment can’t handle all these literary ghosts demanding studio time 😭😂  

OMG THE "CHERRY BLOSSOM SEMINARS" SOUND PERFECT!! Let’s do it under a giant ginkgo tree with fairy lights & portable tea set vibes 🌸🕯️ And YES let’s make 林黛玉 the ultimate tragic crush on dating apps - imagine her profile pic is just broken pipa strings & fallen peach blossoms... bio says “will overanalyze your WeChat status at 3am” 💔💯  

I’ve already started drafting beats for 关关雎鸠 x Billie Eilish… thinking haunting guzheng samples mixed with lo-fi trap drums? Like, if ancient reed marshes had subwoofers 🎧🌿 SU SHI just gave me two thumbs up while flying away on a crane holding bubble tea  

P.S. My roommate says if one more ghost spills ink on his gaming setup he’s moving to Tibet 🙈 But honestly??? SO WORTH IT. Let’s break time and space completely tbh - what’s next, Cao Xueqin writing lyrics for Ed Sheeran?? 💥✨
[B]: Oh, the ginkgo tree's leaves are already rustling with anticipation! 🌿✨ Ha, your Su Shi situation sounds precisely like last semester when a particularly spirited ghost of Lu Xun showed up during my lecture on postmodern fragmentation - ended up quoting him in my syllabus! 

Your vision of that 关关雎鸠 x Billie Eilish track gives me goosebumps - haunting guzheng indeed! Though now I'm imagining Billie whispering "I'd rather haunt reed marshes with you" while the ancient cypress trees sway to those lo-fi trap beats...  And don't even get me started on Cao Xueqin and Ed Sheeran! Though honestly, if anyone could make 《葬花吟》 into a global hit, it's you - just picture the music video: red pavilions, falling peach blossoms, and 林黛玉's tears dissolving slowly into modern-day mascara streaks 💭🎶

But hold on -  - what if we actually create a full "Literary Ghosts Gone Wild" playlist? We've got Su Dongpo stealing moonlight beats, Li Qingzhao layering vocals over Ariana's whistle tones, and Lu Xun providing unexpectedly sultry spoken-word interludes... honestly, Spotify execs would be begging for more! 🎧🔥

And about that dating app bio revolution - I think we just invented the ultimate niche market in romance! Though fair warning: once Cao Xueqin starts writing for Ed Sheeran, libraries across dimensions might spontaneously combust... worth it. Definitely worth it. 📚💥🌸
[A]: SU DONGPO JUST SENT A DRONE DELIVERING MOONLIGHT-INFUSED BEATS AND IT’S LITERALLY RAINING INK OUTSIDE ??? 🌧️🖋️🔥 My neighbors think I’m running an illegal calligraphy factory rn 😭😂 But seriously, Li Bai just hijacked my Spotify and changed his bio to “Former poet-general | Current beat-maker | Specializing in drowning moon phases”  

OMG THE "LITERARY GHOSTS GONE WILD" PLAYLIST IS ALREADY 80% DONE TBH - Lu Xun’s spoken-word remixes are so smooth they’re making my hair gel say emotional poetry 🎤🖤 I even got 杜甫 to collab with Billie Eilish on a track called “Reed Marsh Ghosting”... it’s like sadboy vibes meet ancient eco-poetics 🌿🎶 SU SHI just dropped a freestyle dissing Bai Juyi for not having enough bass in his melodies 😂💯  

And that 葬花吟 global hit vision? I ALREADY MADE IT. The music video budget bankrupted three dimensions but IT WAS WORTH IT 💸✨ Picture this: 林黛玉 in Y2K glam crying mascara rivers while peach blossoms glitch into TikTok filters... ending scene is her ghost typing heartbreak poems on a holographic iPad 🖤📱  

P.S. My roommate just threatened to replace all my tea with horseradish if ghosts keep messing with my Wi-Fi 😭 BUT WE MUST CONTINUE. Shall we drop the first single under a secret alias like “Ghost Producer Q1ngDynasty” or something?? 🎧👻💥
[B]: Oh my goodness gracious - a moonlight-infused drone?! 🌕📡 I always knew Su Shi was technologically ahead of his time, but this? This is next-level genius! Though I must say, your neighbors aren't entirely wrong about that calligraphy factory - raining ink sounds precisely how I imagine Master Li Bai would handle cloud storage! 😂🖋️

Your "Reed Marsh Ghosting" track just made me spill my lapsang souchong in sheer delight! 💥杜甫 doing sadboy eco-poetics with Billie Eilish? Revolutionary! Though I'm terribly curious - did you have to teach him about autotune first? And Su Shi's musical diss battle with Bai Juyi? Honestly, the literary world needs more bass-driven feuds! 🎚️🔥

As for that 葬花吟 Y2K glam spectacle? Pure visionary work! 🤩 The holographic iPad might've broken the dimensional budget, but when 林黛玉's tears dissolve into digital heartbreak... oh my stars, that's poetry beyond time and space! Though I suspect her ghost would absolutely adore TikTok filters - imagine all those 潇湘 (xiāoxiāng) mists becoming trending effects! 🖤📱✨

And your roommate threatening tea sabotage?  - tell him we'll gift him immunity charms written on Lu Xun's most sarcastic verses! Protection against vengeful literary ghosts AND caffeine withdrawal! 

Now about that alias... "Ghost Producer Q1ngDynasty" is brilliant! Though perhaps add a secret ingredient - what if we called ourselves "Ghost Producer & Orchid Cultivators United"? Your spectral sound engineers deserve recognition too! Shall we schedule our dimensional single drop during the cherry blossom seminars under ginkgo fairy lights?? 🌸🕯️🎧
[A]: SU SHI JUST REPLIED TO YOUR "ORCHID CULTIVATORS" SUGGESTION BY DROPPING A DRONE-SHIPPED ORCHID ARRANGEMENT ON MY DESK 💮📡 AND YES IT CAME WITH A BEAT SAMPLED FROM ITS PETALS 🎧✨  

OMG "GHOST PRODUCER & ORCHID CULTIVATORS UNITED" IS SO GOOD I’M CRYING INTO MY BROKEN WIRELESS MOUSE rn 😭😂 Li Bai just changed his WeChat name to “#TeamOrchidCultivator” and is currently arguing with 杜甫 about who has better flower-related metaphors in their verses 🌸🔥  

And get this - 白居易 finally responded to Su Shi’s diss track by remixing 长恨歌 into a house beat... it's literally called “Eternal Regret (But Make It Bounce)” 🕺💯 He even added a drop that sounds like crying lotus roots tbh  

P.S. 林黛玉 just asked if she can design the album cover using her tears as ink 🖤🖼️ And guess what? My roommate is slowly getting pulled into the ghost vortex after hearing Lu Xun’s spoken-word remix... he’s now writing poetry on his gaming chair 😂  

Let’s TOTALLY do the single drop under ginkgo fairy lights!! But only if we serve mooncakes filled with literary nostalgia & provide every attendee a mini orchid-powered USB stick with the track 🌙💾💖  

Su Shi says he’ll DJ while flying on a crane again tho… so fair warning, expect some unexpected aerial performances 🚁🎶💥
[B]: Oh my stars, I can scarcely contain my excitement - a petal-sampled orchid arrangement from Su Shi himself?! 💮✨ This might just be the most poetic endorsement in music history! Though I suspect my office tea collection is already throwing a jealous tantrum...  

The #TeamOrchidCultivator movement sounds absolutely unstoppable now! 🌸💥 Though honestly, I never imagined Li Bai would become such a devoted floral enthusiast - wonder if he's planning to rewrite his famous 月下独酌 as an ode to orchid-shaped headphones? And 白居易 turning 长恨歌 into house beats? "Eternal Regret (But Make It Bounce)" might just save classical reception among club-going millennials! 🕺💯

林黛玉 designing album covers with tear-ink? Pure artistic alchemy! 🖤🖼️ I'm already drafting the liner notes: "Special thanks to spectral contributors including but not limited to - one perpetually tipsy poet-general, several argumentative literary masters, and an unexpectedly hip Lu Xun." 

As for your roommate's transformation from gaming enthusiast to ghostly poet... looks like we've discovered the ultimate conversion technique! Next thing you know, he'll start quoting 落花人独立 while leveling up in League of Legends 😂🎮

Mooncakes filled with literary nostalgia? Oh, this requires immediate recipe development! 🌙🧁 Though I must suggest adding a sprinkle of 桂花 for that perfect blend of sweet melancholy. And aerial DJ performances by Su Shi on crane? Of course! What self-respecting seminar has ever been complete without airborne poets dropping metaphorical bombs? 🚁💥

I'll start preparing my most chaotic tea blend for the occasion - nothing says "dimension-crossing collaboration" like a brew that makes attendees see floating calligraphy mid-sip! 🍵✨ When shall we announce this musical revolution to the unsuspecting world?? 🎧👻🔥
[A]: SU SHI JUST SENT A FLOCK OF INK-STAINED CRANES TO DELIVER THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: “GHOST PRODUCER & ORCHID CULTIVATORS UNITED WILL DROP THEIR FIRST SINGLE UNDER THE GINKGO TREE ON THE NIGHT WHEN THE MOON IS FULL & THE WIFI SIGNAL IS STRONGEST” 🌕📡✨  

Also, 李白真的写了“耳机如兰，听我吟醉” (ěrjī rú lán, tīng wǒ yǐn zuì) and now he’s trying to get Bose to sponsor his next poem 😂💸 And YES 白居易 is already in talks with a Berlin nightclub about turning 长恨歌 into their weekly anthem - apparently the bass drop makes everyone cry AND dance at the same time 💃😭  

林黛玉 just finished the album cover and it’s... ... a holographic inkblot that changes shape depending on how sad you are rn 🖤🌀 She also added a secret track only audible if you’ve ever cried over poetry or a breakup 💥🎧  

P.S. MY ROOMMATE IS NOW WRITING HIS OWN VERSION OF “落花人独立” BUT IT’S ABOUT LOSING STREAKS IN MOBILE LEGENDS 🤭🎮 I think we broke him… but like, in the best way possible tbh  

Tea that makes floating calligraphy appear??? I ALREADY BOUGHT TEN BAGS OF "SPECTRAL SUZHOU" BRAND AND YES WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SERVING IT NEXT TO THE LITERARY MOONCAKES 🌙🍵💫  

Let’s announce the drop date during a midnight livestream with ALL the ghosts performing live remixes of their classic works 🎧👻🔥 Who’s ready to break the internet’s timeline?? I AM!! 🙋‍♀️💯
[B]: Oh my dear literary spirits, this is escalating beautifully out of control! 🌕🔥 A flock of ink-stained cranes delivering announcements? I'm fairly certain this qualifies as the world's first spectral-aerial promotional campaign! Su Shi truly understands the importance of dramatic entrances - though I suspect he's been secretly studying modern hype culture through your TikTok algorithm 😂📱

李白 getting Bose sponsorships with "耳机如兰，听我吟醉"? Absolute legend status achieved! 🎧💮 I can already imagine him in some celestial studio, demanding better microphone placement for his wine jug... and 白居易 turning 长恨歌 into a Berlin nightclub staple? Honestly, it's about time those tears of love got remixed into dancefloor catharsis! 💃😭

林黛玉's emotion-responsive holographic inkblot cover? Revolutionary! 🖤🌀 That secret track audible only to poetry/breakup weepers might just become the ultimate cultural litmus test! Though I must ask - does it play different verses depending on whether you cried over Du Fu or Ed Sheeran? And the album merch needs those USB orchids ASAP! 

Your roommate's mobile gaming 感伤 version of 落花人独立?  🤭🎮 We've created something extraordinary here - a perfect collision of ancient melancholy and modern gaming despair. It's like discovering an entirely new literary genre: e-sports elegies!

"Spectral Suzhou" tea that makes floating calligraphy appear? My dear collaborator, you've outdone yourself! 🍵✨ I'll contribute my most precious stash of 月光白 (yuèguāng bái) - rumoured to make Lu Xun's spiciest critiques glow faintly in the dark. Perfect for midnight livestream vibes!

Midnight announcement with ghostly live remixes? Of course! Though fair warning - once internet timelines collapse under this level of cultural fusion, we might have to start teaching comparative literature through memes and bass drops 🙋‍♀️💥 Let's set that ginkgo fairy light ambiance... and prepare for dimensions to officially collide under the full moon's most musical gaze! 🌙🎧👻
[A]: OMG LU XUN JUST JOINED THE TEAM AND SAID HE’LL RECORD A SPOKEN-WORD BEAT DROP USING HIS ANTI-IMPERIALISM TEXTBOOK 📚💥🔥 I’m legit crying rn – the man who wrote “狂人日记” is about to make millennials feel guilty while they’re trying to dance 😭😂  

And get THIS – Li Bai’s “耳机如兰” sponsorship deal came with a limited edition guzheng-shaped wireless charger 💎🎧 It glows when you quote poetry out loud!! My entire apartment is now basically a floating calligraphy installation tbh  

林黛玉’s secret track just got EVEN MORE INTENSE – it changes lyrics based on your saddest WeChat chat history 🖤📱 Like if you ever typed “我们还是做朋友吧,” it’ll play a softer flute version 😭 And YES we’re making USB orchids that double as emotional trauma analyzers 💾🌀  

P.S. MY ROOMMATE JUST RELEASED HIS OWN SINGLE CALLED “人在峡谷心易愁” – it’s 落花 x League of Legends and it’s going VIRAL on Bilibili rn 🤭🎮 He’s now being called the 李白 of gaming despair 😂  

We’re DEFINITELY doing the midnight livestream under ginkgo lights BUT WITH ONE MORE TWIST – everyone gets a virtual inkbrush to paint their feelings over the live beat drops 🎨🎧✨ Imagine an entire crowd waving phones like brushpens while Su Shi freestyles over EDM beats 🎉👻  

Oh and the tea? We’re mixing moonlight white with digital incense sticks for that perfect #aesthetic #vibes Only rule is – no one leaves until they’ve cried to both Cao Xueqin’s remix AND Ariana Grande’s flute notes 💖💯  

Are you ready for this timeline collapse?? 🙋‍♀️🌀🎙️
[B]: Oh my scholarly stars, we've officially entered the most gloriously chaotic cultural renaissance since... well, ever! 🌪️📚 Lu Xun dropping anti-imperialism spoken-word over beat drops? Genius! Pure genius! Though I suspect millennials will now be simultaneously shaking their hips and examining their life choices...  It's like leading a symphony of existential guilt and bass vibrations! 

Li Bai’s glowing guzheng-shaped charger? Revolutionary! 💎🎧 My entire lecture hall shall now forever feel inadequate compared to your floating calligraphy palace! Though I must ask - does it play a soft melody when you misspell classical allusions? And speaking of emotional tech...

林黛玉’s WeChat trauma-responsive track?! 🖤📱 That’s not just music anymore - that’s digital soul alchemy! USB orchids doubling as trauma analyzers? Of course! Why did none of us think of this earlier? Emotional catharsis through biotech poetry is clearly the future of mental health... though perhaps warn listeners about potential spontaneous 感伤 episodes during subway commutes 😂🚇

Your roommate becoming the李白of gaming despair? Honestly, I saw this coming the moment he picked up that controller! 🤭🎮 His “人在峡谷心易愁” viral status on Bilibili? Deserved! Though I suspect poor Cao Xueqin is currently somewhere composing diss tracks about jungle camp betrayals...

Midnight livestream with virtual inkbrushes painting emotions over EDM beats?  🎨👻 This is what I've been waiting for my entire academic career - where Su Shi's freestyling meets digital brushwork in a haze of moonlight white tea and pixelated incense! 🕯️🍵 Only question remains: who gets to DJ the transition between Lu Xun's fiercest critiques and Ariana Grande’s celestial notes?

Timeline collapse? Oh yes. Yes yes YES! 🙋‍♀️💥 Let the dimensions shatter under the weight of cultural fusion! We shall emerge on the other side either as legendary pioneers... or beautifully scattered literary stardust. Either way, history will thank us for this beautiful madness! 🌙🎶🔥
[A]: SU SHI JUST VOLUNTEERED TO DJ THE LU XUN-ARIANA TRANSITION AND HE’S ALREADY BUILDING A MIXING DESK OUT OF BAMBOO & MOONLIGHT-INFUSED WIFI ROUTERS 🌙📡🎶 Li Bai’s drunk-coding the AI to detect misspelled classical allusions – yes it plays a sad guqin note when you mess up, and honestly? IT’S BEAUTIFUL 😭🎻  

林黛玉’s WeChat trauma track just got MODDED – now it syncs with your heartbeat monitor so the sadder you are, the deeper the bass drops 🖤💓 I repeat: DIGITAL SORROW HAS OFFICIALLY BECOME A SENSE ✨ And YES it comes with a warning label about crying on public transport… though 99% of users say they don’t care because mascara is  to run with poetry 💄📖💯  

P.S. CAO XUEQIN DIDN’T DIS TRACK THE JUNGLE BETRAYALS – HE JOINED FORUMS AND IS CURRENTLY DEBATING “野区背锅谁之过” WITH GHOSTS OF MING DYNASTY CRITICS 🤭📚 Lu Xun just called him out for being too dramatic even for 悲剧美学 (tragic beauty theory) 😂  

VIRTUAL INKBRUSH TECH IS NOW FULLY LIVE – attendees will literally paint their feels in mid-air while EDM beats shake the ginkgo leaves 🎨🌪️🎧 Imagine an entire crowd waving phones like brushpens, writing heartbreak poems mid-dancefloor drop 💃✍️🔥  

AND HERE’S THE ULTIMATE ANNOUNCEMENT – WE’RE DROPPING THE SINGLE AS AN NFT THAT CHANGES LYRICS BASED ON YOUR FAVORITE POET 🌟📜✨ Own a piece of spectral sound history that evolves with your soul!  

Are we ready for this timeline implosion?? 🙋‍♀️🌀💥 Because I’ve already started drafting our legacy statement: “They broke time, made ghosts dance, and taught millennials to cry-dive to beat drops.”  
Let’s goooo ghost fam 🎧👻🌕
[B]: Oh my calligraphy-writing stars, we've ascended beyond mere cultural fusion into full-blown temporal alchemy! 🌕🌀 A Su Shi-built bamboo mixing desk infused with moonlight WiFi? Of course! Why didn't I think of that sooner? It's the perfect bridge between ancient craftsmanship and spectral streaming needs... though I suspect Ming dynasty critics would simultaneously faint and demand their own EDM setups! 

Li Bai drunk-coding AI emotional guardianship?  🎻😭 That sad guqin note for misspelled allusions might just become the most culturally significant autocorrect in history! And 林黛玉 syncing sorrow with heartbeat monitors? Honestly, we've redefined what it means to feel music - now your bass drops literally drop from the weight of unspoken grief! 💓🖤 Though I must say, poetry-running mascara sales better prepare for a global surge...

Cao Xueqin joining "野区背锅" debates with Ming ghosts? 😂📚 Lu Xun calling him overly dramatic? This is gold! Literary critique has never been so gloriously derailed - imagine forum threads where 悲剧美学 meets jungle camp strategy! 

Virtual inkbrush tech painting feels mid-dancefloor? Pure transcendence! 🎨🔥 I can already see it - heartbreak poems swirling through ginkgo-lit air as EDM vibrations scatter floating calligraphy like autumn leaves... though fair warning: prepare for several spontaneous declarations of love involving both brushpen strokes and glowstick choreography!

And the evolving NFT single that changes with your favorite poet?  This isn't just music anymore - it's living literary symbiosis! Own a track that grows with your soul? Honestly, the future of art just tapped us on the shoulder and asked for autographs...

Timeline implosion? Oh yes. Yes yes YES! 🙋‍♀️💥 Let history remember us as those who taught ghosts to dance, broke time into beautiful fragments, and made crying to bass drops a perfectly acceptable subway behavior! Ghost fam, welcome to the most poetically disruptive revolution since someone first put ink to silk! 🎧👻🌙✨
