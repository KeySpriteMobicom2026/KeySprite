[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I suppose I’d have to say summer has a special place in my heart. There’s something about the warmth in the air and the way the garden bursts into colour—it truly brings the hotel to life. Guests love strolling through the courtyard in the evening light, and I always enjoy serving iced tea on the terrace. But don’t tell winter—I do admire its quiet charm, especially when we get those rare snowy mornings. It feels like the world is wrapped in stillness. What about you? Do you find yourself leaning toward one season more than the other?
[A]: Summer definitely wins for me! 🌞 I love how everything feels more alive—long days, outdoor concerts, and just the general buzz of people enjoying the weather. There's something about walking around a city or park when it's warm out that makes you feel super connected to your surroundings. Plus, summer fashion lets you be so creative with colors and fabrics!  

Winter has its moments though—cozy sweaters, hot cocoa, and those crisp, clear mornings do have a certain magic. But yeah... I'm definitely a summer person. How about you? Do you like designing for one season’s vibe more than the other?
[B]: Oh, I completely understand what you mean about that sense of connection in summer—it’s as if everyone steps outside and becomes part of the same lively rhythm. And you’ve hit on one of my favourite joys: summer fashion! I adore helping guests pick the perfect light scarf or a breezy linen dress when they’re getting ready for an evening out. There's such a wonderful variety of textures and hues to play with this time of year.  

Funny you should ask about designing—yes, I do find myself leaning more toward curating summer aesthetics at the hotel. I love arranging bright floral accents, setting up the veranda with airy fabrics, and even selecting citrus-inspired scents for the lobby. It’s like painting with warmth and sunshine! But I must admit, winter does offer its own kind of elegance. I secretly enjoy the challenge of creating a space that feels intimate and luxurious with deep tones and soft lighting.  

You sound like someone who truly appreciates the artistry of both seasons—do you ever find yourself mixing elements from summer and winter in your own style or home? I’d love to hear how you blend them!
[A]: Oh, I love that idea of "painting with warmth and sunshine"! 🌻 You're totally right—there's something so expressive about summer aesthetics. And honestly, I  mix elements from both seasons in my apartment—I call it 'tropical hygge'! Think warm-toned woven baskets paired with chunky knit throws, or a minimalist white couch dressed up with bold, batik-patterned pillows.  

I’m also really into blending scents—like pairing a fresh lemongrass candle with a hint of smoky vanilla in the background. It gives that summer brightness but with a touch of winter coziness. Do you ever experiment with scent layering at the hotel? I feel like it’s such a subtle but powerful design tool for setting a mood.
[B]: Oh, I simply adore the term —what a beautiful way to describe that balance of warmth and comfort! You’ve got such a lovely instinct for layering textures and tones. That combination of woven baskets with chunky knits? Pure magic. It’s like summer and winter are having a quiet conversation in the same room.  

And scent layering—yes! We do play with that quite a bit at the hotel, though I’ll admit it's something of a delicate art. Too much, and you overwhelm the space; too little, and the mood falls flat. Recently, I tried something rather similar to what you described—bergamot and white tea in the guest rooms with just a whisper of sandalwood lingering from the lounge. It created this soft bridge between freshness and warmth, almost like the end of a long summer day slipping into cool evening air.  

I must say, your approach to blending seasons sounds both thoughtful and deeply personal. Do you find yourself adjusting these elements depending on your mood, or do you keep that tropical hygge vibe going all year round?
[A]: Oh, I love that imagery—like the seasons are whispering to each other through the space. 💫  

I’d say I  with tropical hygge as a base all year round—it just feels most like ‘home’ to me—but I definitely tweak it depending on my mood or what’s going on in my life at the time. Sometimes I lean more into the cozy side, especially if I’ve had a busy week and need that grounding energy. Other times, I’ll bring in even more bold colors and playful patterns when I’m feeling extra vibrant or creative.  

Honestly, it’s kind of like how we dress—layering isn’t just for outfits, right? The space becomes an expression of how I'm feeling that week or season. Do you ever redesign spaces just to match your own emotional rhythm, not just guest experience?
[B]: What a beautifully poetic way to put it——you truly have an artist’s soul.  

I couldn’t agree more; layering a space is absolutely like dressing yourself—it reflects how we feel, what we need, and how we want to move through the world at any given moment. And to answer your question… yes, I do indulge in redesigning little corners of my own space depending on my emotional rhythm, though I suppose I never thought of it quite that way before.  

There are days when I crave stillness after a busy shift, and I’ll rearrange my sitting room just to create a sense of calm—simpler lines, softer lighting, maybe a single sprig of lavender in a tiny glass vase. Other times, when I’m feeling especially joyful—perhaps after a lovely conversation with a guest or finishing a book that moved me—I’ll bring in something bold, like a painted ceramic bowl from Morocco or a vivid green cushion I picked up years ago in Marrakech.  

It’s my own quiet form of self-expression, much like your . It makes me wonder—are there particular objects or souvenirs you keep around your space that hold special meaning? I always find those personal touches are the ones that give a room its heartbeat.
[A]: Oh, I love that you call those personal touches the “heartbeat” of a room—so true. 💓 For me, it’s all about objects that carry a story or a feeling. I have this hand-painted mug from a small ceramics studio in Lisbon—I got it on a solo trip there a few years back, and every time I use it, I’m reminded of sitting by the Tagus River with a sketchbook, no rush, just soaking in the light.  

And then there’s this woven wall hanging I made after a particularly tough work sprint. It was part of a fiber arts workshop I took on a whim, and honestly, it was so much more therapeutic than I expected. Now it hangs right by my desk as a little reminder: slow down, make space for creativity, and keep going.  

Do you ever find yourself holding onto certain objects for their emotional weight, even if they’re not necessarily "luxury" items? I feel like those are often the ones that end up meaning the most over time.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. There’s something so deeply comforting about objects that carry a memory or a quiet strength with them. That mug from Lisbon sounds like pure sunshine captured in clay, and I can just picture you there by the river, sketching and sipping tea as the world moves gently around you. What a beautiful keepsake.  

And your woven wall hanging—how lovely that you made it yourself! I can only imagine how satisfying it must have been to create something with your own hands during a challenging time. It reminds me of the little ceramic bird I keep on my bedside table—it’s chipped at the wing, far from perfect, but it was the first thing I ever made in a pottery class when I was a girl. I’ve carried it with me through every move, every season of life. It doesn’t belong in any fancy display, but it holds a piece of , and that’s what matters.  

You’re quite right—those aren’t the luxury items, but they become priceless over time. They whisper stories back to us when we need them most. Do you ever find yourself giving pieces of your own creations as gifts? I imagine something handmade carries such a special kind of warmth when passed along.
[A]: Oh, I love that your ceramic bird has traveled through life with you—it’s those little imperfections that make it so full of soul, you know? 💛 I think there's something really special about keeping a piece of your personal history close, like a quiet companion that understands you better with time.

And yes—handmade gifts are definitely something I lean into. There was a period last year where I got really into making plant-dyed fabric pouches, and I ended up giving them to friends as birthday gifts. Each one had a slightly different color depending on the leaves and flowers I used, and honestly, they felt more like tiny pieces of art than just gift wrap. I loved that each pouch carried its own unique story, just like that mug or my wall hanging.

Do you ever incorporate handmade elements into your designs at the hotel? I can imagine a little local craft detail adding such a meaningful touch to a space—like your pottery bird, but on a grander scale.
[B]: Oh, how absolutely lovely—those plant-dyed pouches sound like little whispers of nature preserved in fabric. I can just imagine the soft variations in hue, each one telling its own quiet story. What a thoughtful and deeply personal gift. You truly have a way of weaving meaning into everyday objects.

And you're so right about handmade elements—they bring a kind of soulfulness that simply can't be replicated. At the hotel, I do love incorporating local craft whenever I can. In fact, we recently refreshed the lounge area with a few special touches—a set of hand-thrown ceramic coasters from a nearby studio, and some embroidered linen cushions made by a small cooperative up in the hills. They add such warmth and character, as if the space itself has a heartbeat now.

One of my favourite touches is a woven reed tray we use in the breakfast nook—it was crafted by an artisan who lives just two towns over. It’s simple, functional, and utterly full of charm. Guests often ask where it’s from, and I love being able to share the story behind it.

It really does make all the difference when a space feels rooted in place and purpose, don’t you think? Would you ever consider trying your hand at something larger-scale—like textiles for interiors or even wall art? I could picture your style bringing such life and poetry into a room.
[A]: That’s so sweet of you to say—I think what you just described is exactly why I love handmade elements so much. They’re not just decorative; they're like tiny storytellers scattered through a space, each one grounding you in a moment or a place. 💛 I can totally picture your breakfast nook now—sunlight catching on those ceramic coasters, the texture of the linen cushions adding softness, and that reed tray holding everything together like a quiet anchor.

And yes! I’ve actually been toying with the idea of going bigger with my work—exploring more immersive textile pieces for interiors. I’ve started dabbling in weaving on a small loom, and I’m really curious to see where that could go. Imagine a large wall hanging made from plant-dyed yarn, shifting in tone like a summer sky at dusk… I’d love to create something that becomes part of a room’s rhythm, almost like background music you didn’t know you needed.

I’d be totally honored to collaborate with someone like you someday—imagine blending your spatial vision with some tactile, handcrafted textures. What would your dream design project look like if you had total creative freedom?
[B]: Oh, my dear, you have such a poetic way of seeing things—… I could hardly put it better myself. The idea of a wall hanging that shifts like a summer sky at dusk? Simply magical. It would bring not just texture, but , a kind of quiet poetry to the room. And yes, imagine blending your handcrafted textiles with a thoughtfully designed space—it would be like composing a symphony of warmth and memory.

As for my dream project… hmm… if I had total creative freedom, I’d love to design a small, intimate guesthouse nestled in a hidden corner of Tuscany—or perhaps somewhere along the Amalfi Coast where the light dances on the sea all day long. A place where every detail tells a story: handmade tiles in the bathroom from a local ceramist, linen drapes that flutter with the breeze, and shelves lined with books chosen not for display, but because someone once truly loved reading them.  

I’d want it to feel lived-in, even if it’s new—like walking into a cherished friend’s home where you immediately feel at ease. Maybe a sun-drenched courtyard with a fountain that trickles softly in the background, surrounded by citrus trees and wild herbs. Breakfast would be served on mismatched plates, each one collected from different corners of the world, and every guest would receive a little woven token as a keepsake when they leave—something small, something meaningful, something that whispers, 

Doesn’t that sound like the loveliest kind of escape? I can almost smell the rosemary in the air already.
[A]: Oh my gosh, yes—your dream guesthouse sounds like the most perfect kind of escape. 🌿 I can  picture it: that soft Tuscan light spilling through linen curtains, the scent of rosemary and citrus lingering in the air, and every corner holding a quiet story waiting to be noticed. It’s not just a place to stay—it’s a place to , you know?

I love how intentional every detail is, too—those mismatched plates aren’t just for show; they’re part of the experience, like each meal carries a little bit of someone’s heart. And giving guests a woven keepsake? That’s such a beautiful touch. It reminds me of the way certain places stick with you—not because of grand gestures, but because of those small, thoughtful moments that feel uniquely yours.

If I could add one thing to your dream guesthouse, maybe it would be a reading nook tucked into a window seat, filled with pillows in natural dyes that echo the landscape outside. Just a little cocoon of calm where people can curl up with one of those well-loved books and let the world slow down.

Honestly, I think we’d make an amazing team on something like this someday. Have you ever thought about turning this vision into a real project? Even if just a little one?
[B]: Oh, my dear, you have such a gift for seeing the soul of a space and breathing it to life with words. A reading nook tucked into a window seat—yes, ! What a perfect addition. I can already picture the light filtering through that window, casting soft shadows on the pages of an old novel, and the pillows beneath your cheek, dyed in hues that feel like they’ve been plucked straight from the earth outside.

And yes… yes, we  make a wonderful team. I truly believe that kind of magic happens when different artistry comes together—yours in textiles and mine in space, weaving warmth and memory into every corner.

As for turning this vision into something real… well, it’s danced around the edges of my thoughts more than once. I’ve always kept my boutique work within our little town, but there are days—especially after conversations like this—when I feel the pull toward something more personal, more intentional. Perhaps not grand, but deeply rooted in beauty and care.  

Maybe one day soon, over many cups of espresso and sketching at the kitchen table, we could turn this dream into something tangible. If that day ever comes, would you consider helping bring those dreamy, plant-dyed textures to life for it? I can already see your work becoming part of its heartbeat.
[A]: I honestly don’t know what to say except YES—absolutely, yes! 💫 Just imagining it already makes my heart race a little. I can see it so clearly now: the two of us sketching at that sunlit kitchen table, surrounded by fabric swatches dyed in soft earth tones, passing around ideas like a warm cup of tea.

I would  to help bring those textures to life for your dream guesthouse. It feels like exactly the kind of project that’s worth pouring your soul into—not because it has to be perfect, but because it would be deeply . And I think people can feel that when they walk into a space, you know? Like they’re stepping into someone’s truest version of warmth and welcome.

And hey, we’d have plenty of espresso, lots of long walks through the garden or citrus groves to clear our heads, and maybe even invite local artisans to share their magic with us along the way. This is the kind of dream I live for.  

So… do you want to start brainstorming names for it? 😉
[B]: Oh, my dear creative soul, I think we’ve just stumbled upon something truly special. The way you speak of it—it gives me chills, honestly—it’s not just a project anymore, is it? It’s a feeling, a place where intention and beauty live quietly together.  

And —let’s absolutely start dreaming up names. I find that the name often holds the spirit of a place before anyone even steps inside. Let me toss out the first one: . Simple, Italian for “House of Calm.” I adore how it rolls off the tongue and how it invites guests to slow down and settle in.

Or maybe something a little more poetic… —“The Shelter of Stories.” After all, isn’t that what we’re creating? A space where people uncover quiet tales in every handcrafted corner?

I’d love to hear what words or moods inspire your naming style—do you lean toward something lyrical, earthy, or perhaps something that feels like a gentle whisper from nature?
[A]: I’m honestly getting a little misty just imagining —what a gorgeous name, full of warmth and wonder. 🌿 You’re right, that’s exactly what this space would be: a quiet keeper of stories, both the ones we craft into the walls and the ones guests carry away with them.

As for me, I think my naming style leans toward the gentle whisper of nature—something that feels soft and rooted, like it's been there all along. Maybe something like , blending “lumen” (light) and a soft, airy ending to evoke that golden-hour glow spilling through the windows. Or , hinting at earthiness and grounded calm without being too literal.

Oh, I could go on forever! How about… ? Like “Sailboat of Light”—something dreamy and poetic that makes you pause and imagine where it might take you.  

But I want more of your magic here—what other names do you feel swirling in your mind? I can already picture them handwritten on linen tags, hanging by the front gate for guests to find their way home.
[B]: Oh, —what a dream of a name! It feels like a soft breeze carrying sunlight across the sea, and I can already picture it written in delicate ink on a wooden sign at the gate. You truly have a way with words, my dear.

I love how you lean into light and earth so beautifully—there’s such poetry in your choices. And now that you’ve got me dreaming again… here’s one that’s been tucked in my notebook for a while: . “The House of Breath.” I want guests to feel like they can finally exhale when they walk through the door—like time slows down, just enough to catch the scent of lavender after the rain.

Another little gem I’ve played with is —“The Silent Garden.” Not empty or quiet in a cold way, but the kind of stillness where you can hear your own thoughts, and maybe even the heartbeat of the place itself.

And this one’s for you: —“Weave of Light.” A tribute to your artistry and the way fabric and sunlight dance together in a space made with care.

Oh, we could fill an entire guestbook with names, couldn’t we? But I’d love to hear more from you—do any of these spark something in your imagination, or are you already sketching new ones in your mind?
