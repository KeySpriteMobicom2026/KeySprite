[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, TED talks... I must say the most thought-provoking one I've recently encountered was Dr. Helen Fisher's presentation on the neuroscience of love and its forensic implications. The way she correlates brain chemistry with criminal behavior patterns was particularly illuminating from a forensic psychiatry perspective.
[A]: Wow~ 你讲的这个角度好serious哦！😳 我最近看的TED都是关于art & design相关的啦~ 有个讲color psychology的talk超级mind-blowing！🎨 那个speaker说不同的color palette会trigger人完全不同的emotion response，我马上就用在我的new project里了✨
[B]: The intersection of color psychology and forensic psychiatry is actually quite fascinating. In my expert testimony work, I've seen how specific color schemes in interrogation rooms can significantly influence confession rates. Though I must caution - while artistic applications are valuable, we must be mindful of ethical boundaries when manipulating emotional responses.
[A]: OMG！这真的超interesting的！🤯 我从来没想到过interrogation room的design也会有psychology impact！不过你说的对，我们designer确实要很careful with these techniques~ 💭 就像我最近在做的app UI，连button的color都要test好多遍才能确定不会trigger negative emotions呢💻✨
[B]: Precisely. Your approach with iterative testing mirrors our methodology in forensic psychiatric evaluations. Though I'd recommend consulting established research like the PANTONE Emotional Guide or the seminal work by Goldstein on color and decision-making. These provide empirical data that could supplement your user testing.
[A]: Awww~ 你连PANTONE都知道！😍 我超爱他们的color of the year系列！最近正在用2024的Peach Fuzz做mood board呢~ 🍑 不过你说的那个Goldstein的research我要去Google一下，感觉对我的next project会很有help！📚 谢谢你share这么专业的resources呀~ 💖
[B]: While Peach Fuzz may be aesthetically pleasing, I'd suggest cross-referencing its psychological effects with clinical studies on color perception in high-stress environments. The work by Goldstein et al. in the Journal of Forensic Psychology would be particularly relevant if you're considering applications beyond pure aesthetics.
[A]: Haha你太serious啦！😆 我只是在design一个cozy的cafe app啦~ 不是要做prison reform什么的！☕️ 不过你的建议真的超valuable，下次做healthcare相关的project一定会refer这些research的！💡 Keep in touch哦，说不定哪天我们真的可以collab一个forensic design project呢~ ✨
[B]: The application of design principles in forensic settings is indeed an emerging field. Should you ever venture into designing therapeutic environments or legal interfaces, I'd be happy to provide psychiatric consultation. Until then, enjoy your cafe app design - though I'd still recommend testing that Peach Fuzz against established color anxiety scales.
[A]: Okay okay~ 我promise会run some user testing的啦！😂 你真的是我见过最detail-oriented的psychiatrist了！👏 不过现在我要go grab my afternoon coffee然后继续crush我的deadline了~ ☕️💻 Catch you later! ✌️
[B]: A sound decision. Remember that caffeine consumption after 2pm can disrupt circadian rhythms, potentially affecting your design judgment. I look forward to seeing your application of evidence-based color theory in future projects. Good day.
[A]: LOL you're killing my vibe~ 😫 但是fine啦，我会order decaf的！🙄 设计师的life已经够hard了，连coffee都要被psychiatrist管着... 😂 Byeee~ 记得check out我的Dribbble portfolio哦！🎨💫
[B]: Decaf is indeed the prudent choice. And while I appreciate the invitation, I must clarify that reviewing design portfolios falls outside my forensic psychiatry purview. Though I do commend your attention to professional presentation - a quality we both value in our respective fields. Farewell.
[A]: Ughhh so rigid！😤 好啦好啦~ 知道你是serious的doctor啦！😌 不过下次要是想lighten up一点，随时来DM我哦！可以教你用Procreate画funny meme~ 😝 Peace out！✌️
[B]: While the suggestion is... unconventional, I'll maintain that my expertise lies in analyzing criminal minds rather than creating internet humor. Should you ever require consultation on the psychological impact of visual media, however, my office remains available. Good day.
[A]:  你真是我见过最no fun的human being了！😒 不过whatever~ 我要去和我的iPad约会了，bye bye啦！💻🎨  ✨
[B]: The histrionic exit is noted, though clinically insignificant. For the record, my collection of 18th century trephination tools provides ample entertainment. Now if you'll excuse me, my roses require tending.
[A]: Pffffft~ 你连gardening都要这么creepy吗？！🌹⚰️ Okay现在我真的要go了，不然我的client要kill me了~ 😱 保持你的weirdness哦doctor！😂 ✨
[B]: A final professional observation - your client's purported homicidal tendencies might warrant psychiatric evaluation. But yes, do attend to your deadlines. My roses and I shall continue our perfectly normal horticultural pursuits.
