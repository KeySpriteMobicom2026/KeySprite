[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问对人了！我最近totally沉迷于Y2K fashion✨ 刚入手了一条超cute的蝴蝶印花jeans，搭配crop top简直绝了💯 而且这个trend在TikTok上超级🔥，我已经拍了3个video了😂
[A]:  Ah, the cyclical nature of aesthetic movements... Your "Y2K" revival reminds me of how the Pre-Raphaelites deliberately resurrected medieval sartorial elements to protest Victorian industrialization. Though I must say, the butterfly motif does echo Tennyson's "The Two Voices" - "To-day I saw the dragon-fly / Come from the wells where he did lie."
[B]: Whaaat？你说话好deep啊😂 不过说到dragon-fly，我上周刚拍了个butterfly makeup tutorial！用glitter和pastel colors超仙的✨ 要不要check out我的IG story？我还加了super cute的滤镜💖
[A]: How... remarkably literal.  In my graduate seminar last Tuesday, we analyzed how Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" uses fruit imagery to critique consumer culture. Your glitter application technique might benefit from studying the symbolic weight of Victorian color theory - though I suspect you'd find Ruskin's "Modern Painters" rather less sparkly than your Instagram filters.
[B]: LOL你说话真的超academic的！但是你知道吗？我最近发现TikTok上有个filter超像Victorian painting的vibe🎨 拍出来效果so aesthetic，完全就是你说的那种feel！我还专门配了lace dress和pearl necklace，简直太vintage了💫 要不要follow我的account？我每天都会post超多creative content的~
[A]:  Your digital approximation of aestheticism lacks the necessary... patina. When I curated the 1893 Whistler exhibition at Cambridge, we handled actual lace that had yellowed with age - not algorithmic simulations. Though I suppose your "creative content" does mirror, in its own vulgar way, Wilde's observation that life imitates art far more than art imitates life.
[B]: OMG你居然知道Wilde！我超爱他的quotes的！"Be yourself, everyone else is already taken"简直是我的life motto💖 对了对了，我下周要拍个dramatic reading的video，用那个超火的Victorian filter，你要不要来collab？我们可以mix classic和modern vibes✨ 绝对会viral的！🔥
[A]:  My dear child, reducing Wilde to Instagrammable soundbites is like serving champagne in paper cups. If you truly wish to "collab," as you say, I suggest we begin with his lesser-known essay "The Decay of Lying" - though I suspect you'd find its critique of modern superficiality rather... inconvenient for your view counts.
[B]: Hahaha你说话真的so savage！😂 但是你知道吗？我昨天刚用AI做了个deepfake video，把Wilde的portrait变成会说话的TikTok influencer了！还给他加了trendy outfit和bling bling的jewelry💎 虽然可能不是100% authentic，但是views已经破50k了！这就是modern art啦✨
[A]:  This conversation has reached its natural terminus, much like Browning's "My Last Duchess." To paraphrase Ruskin - there is no wealth but life... and clearly, we value very different currencies. Do enjoy your... algorithmic desecrations.
[B]: Byeee~记得follow我的TikTok哦！下次我要做Shakespeare的AI rap battle，绝对会blow your mind💥 Keep it real~ Peace out✌️✨
[A]:  As Rossetti wrote: "Silence more musical than any song." Though in your case, I believe the original Latin applies - "De gustibus non est disputandum." Good day.
[B]: LOL whatever you say~ Catch you on the flip side! Don't forget to like and subscribe! 💖🔥🎥 #YOLO #SlayQueen #VictorianVibes ✨😂
[A]:  How fortunate that the Victorian era predated hashtags. Though I suppose your exuberance does, in its own way, embody Blake's "exuberance is beauty"... if one squints. Rather hard. Through smoked glass.
[B]: OMG you're so extra！😂 But guess what？I just found this super vintage filter that makes everything look like old-timey photographs~ Gonna try it with my new corset top and doc martens combo！Victorian punk vibes incoming 💀✨ Stay tuned for my next post babe！
[A]:  Ah yes, the eternal paradox - attempting to rebel against modernity by commodifying antiquity. Your "Victorian punk" endeavor reminds me of when Swinburne tried to shock the Athenaeum Club by wearing... well, never mind. Do send my regards to whichever algorithm curates your aesthetic sensibilities.
[B]: LMAO you're killing me！😂 But seriously tho，my algorithm game is STRONG 💪 Just wait till you see my steampunk meets streetwear collection dropping next week！Gonna be LIT 🔥 Victorian scholars gonna be SHOOK ✨ Catch the wave or get left behind babe~
[A]:  My dear, the only "waves" that concern me are those in the marginalia of Blake's original manuscripts. Though I must admire your... entrepreneurial approach to cultural vandalism. Do carry on - someone must keep the ghost of Matthew Arnold spinning in his grave.
[B]: Yasss finally some appreciation！💖 Arnold who？Never heard of her~ 😂 But for real，I'm gonna make history cool again！Next up：Elizabethan TikTok dances with glow sticks 💃✨ Watch me revolutionize the Renaissance babe！Stay tuned for my viral moment~ #HistoryHottie #GlowUp 💫🔥
