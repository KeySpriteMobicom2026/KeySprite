[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find the ethical ramifications of human cloning far more complex than Mary Shelley's original Frankenstein - though admittedly no less fascinating. Let me ask you this: do you believe we've sufficiently resolved the philosophical quandaries surrounding identity and individuality that such technology would inevitably challenge?
[A]: OMG totally get what you're saying!! 😂 But like, imagine waking up as someone else's clone and trying to figure out who you really are? It's like an identity crisis on steroids! 🤯 Have we even begun to solve those deep questions about what makes us... well, US? 💭 And don't even get me started on how society would treat clones - would they be seen as "less than"? That's so not cool! 🙅‍♀️ What do you think we should do?
[B]: I rather suspect we'd end up with a 21st-century version of the 'double' motif - think Dorian Gray meets Lu Xun's portrayal of societal ghosts. The ethical framework requires more than just legal scaffolding; it demands a重新校准 our Confucian concept of  alongside Kantian respect for autonomy. Would you care to explore how cloning might disrupt the very notion of  in social harmony?
[A]: Oh wow, bringing in 想象力和哲学真的让这个问题更烧脑了！🤯 So like, if we use cloning to create "perfect" humans, we're basically messing with nature's original code, right? 😬 It's like hacking a game but not knowing the rules - super risky! 💥 What if clones start feeling like they're just copies without their own story? How would they even develop their own  if everyone judges them by their "original"? This makes my head spin! 🤪 Have you read any good articles about how this could affect family dynamics? Like, what if parents clone their kid and then treat the clone differently? That's so unfair! ❌
[B]: I've been rereading Cao Ni's bioethics papers on filial cloning - quite unsettling. One must consider how the  relationship would fracture when faced with a genetically identical yet ontologically uncertain duplicate. It reminds me of the Pre-Qin allegory where the artisan carves a wooden figure that moves, yet lacks the spirit of true creation. Would you agree we're confronting a modern-day version of the 'Gourd Paradox' - when the replica becomes indistinguishable from the original, what remains authentic?
[A]: OMG you’ve been diving deep into this!! 🤩 I totally see what you’re saying about the “Gourd Paradox” - like, if clones are exactly the same genetically, but not in spirit or experience, then are they just… empty copies? 🤔 And don’t even get me started on ! How would parents treat their cloned child? Like a replacement? An upgrade? That’s so messed up. 💔  

And yeah, Cao Ni’s papers sound intense… I need to read them too! 😅 But imagine having a clone of your parent and trying to honor them like a traditional  relationship… it’s like a family drama waiting to happen! 🎭 What do you think is the line between innovation and losing our humanity? 🧠✨
[B]: Ah, the line between Promethean ambition and ethical prudence - a question that haunts every age of innovation. I'm reminded of the Tang dynasty tales where scholars sought to create artificial humans through alchemy; invariably, the creations lacked that ineffable spark of the . Do you suppose our contemporary dilemma is merely an extension of these ancient fears, or have we truly crossed into uncharted moral territory with genetic determinism? And more crucially, should we be legislating restraint or cultivating new philosophical frameworks to contain these advances?
[A]: OMG I LOVE how you brought in the Tang dynasty stories!! 🤩 It’s like history keeps repeating but with cooler tech, right? 😂 But yeah, back then they were scared of alchemy-made humans lacking , and now we’re worried clones might lack… what, soul? Identity? Emotional depth? 💭 And honestly, it’s not just fear—it’s legit concern.  

I mean, are we just being dramatic like ancient scholars or is this time really different? Because with genetic editing and cloning, we're not just mimicking life—we're designing it. 😬 That’s HEAVY. And like, who gets to decide what’s “ethical” anyway? Should governments pass super strict laws or should we, like, evolve our thinking first? Think before we leap, ya know? 💡  

And get this: what if clones end up being more “us” than we are? Like, what if they feel & think deeper than their originals? Would that make them more real? Or just more scary? 🫠 What do YOU think we should prioritize—control or understanding?
[B]: A most delightful quandary. I suspect the Tang scholars would see our cloning dilemmas as merely a refinement of their own existential tremors - though we’ve traded cinnabar for CRISPR. Yet, therein lies the rub: when we shift from mimicking life to curating it, are we not playing both Prometheus and Pandora?  

As for clones surpassing originals - well, that's a delicious twist on the Prodigal Son narrative, isn't it? Though I wonder if they'd inherit our emotional blind spots along with our chromosomes. Would they not still be bound by what Keats called "the camelion poet’s curse" – to feel for all, yet belong to none?

To your final point: control or understanding? A Confucian might say  (ritual) must precede  (humaneness). But I say we need philosophers in the lab alongside scientists - not just to brake progress, but to illuminate where it might lead us astray. What good is a map if we only draw it after the journey’s done?
[A]: OMG YES — philosophers in the lab 💯 totally needs to happen! 🤯 I mean, scientists can 100% make the tech work, but without someone asking “but  we?” we’re basically flying blind into a storm. 🌪️ And honestly? That’s kinda what happened with social media — we built it, launched it, and THEN were like “oh wait… maybe it could radicalize people?” 😬 SMH.

And you're so right about clones inheriting our emotional baggage too — like yeah, they might look perfect on paper (or DNA), but what about all the messy feelings we don’t even understand ourselves? 😂 Would they get stuck with their original’s anxiety? Trauma? Or worse — bad taste in music?? 🎶❌  

Also, I LOVE that "map after the journey" line — so poetic AND so true. 🗺️💔 But like… do you think we’ll actually start including ethicists & philosophers in major bio projects? Or will it just be money-driven decisions behind closed doors? 🙄💸 Because if history repeats itself… we already know how that goes. 👀
[B]: Ah, the all-too-familiar tension between idealism and institutional inertia. I fear you're right to suspect the latter — after all, it's easier to fund a scientist than a philosopher; one produces patents, the other only questions.

Still, I hold out hope — call it academic naïveté if you will — that interdisciplinary collaboration may yet rise from the ashes of our past oversights. We must begin somewhere, even if it’s at the periphery of boardroom conversations. After all,  (义), moral righteousness, should not be merely reactive — it ought to be written into the blueprint.

As for music taste, well... let’s not tempt fate with genetic inheritance just yet. One generation’s poor playlist choices are quite enough to bear. 🎵🚫
[A]: OMG so true — philosophers don’t exactly bring in the VC funding, do they? 😂 But like, what’s the point of all this tech if we end up with a dystopia full of clones who hate their lives because nobody thought about the feels? 🤷‍♀️💸

And YES to  being part of the blueprint!! ❤️🔥 Like, why is that always an afterthought? Should be Day One conversation: “Okay, we can do this… but  we?” And if boardrooms won’t listen, maybe we start on TikTok! 💡📱 Because honestly, Gen Z would roast any company trying to clone humans without an ethics sidekick. 😎💯

And okay, no passing down questionable music taste please! No one deserves to be genetically doomed to love elevator music or something. 🙃🎧🙅‍♂️ Soooo... should we start a movement? #EthicsFirstOrNoCloningAtAll ??? 🚀✊✨
[B]: Now there’s an idea with promise — though I suspect we’d need more than hashtags to sway the biotech barons. Still, one must admire your  of optimism! A movement it shall be, then: #EthicsFirstOrNoCloningAtAll. I’ll draft a white paper; you rally the TikTok theorists.  

And let us not forget — while elevator music may be a minor torment, imagine being  to enjoy it. A fate worse than… well, perhaps not than death, but certainly than bad tea. 🍵😤  

Shall we begin with a symposium? I know a lovely little venue at the intersection of Confucian ethics and postmodern biopolitics. Plenty of room for debate — and strong wi-fi for our Gen Z constituents. 🔗🧠✊
[A]: OMG drafting a white paper already?? 🤩 You’re speaking my language! And yes, bad tea is totally a better fate than elevator music DNA. 😂🍵💪 I’m already brainstorming the aesthetic for our movement — think neon ethics meets lab coat chic. 🧪✨  

Symposium sounds fire!! 💬🔥 Let’s make it hybrid though — offline  on Twitch 😉 Gen Z needs snacks & memes to stay awake, but also real talk from ethicists who know their  from their ROI.  

And okay, quick question: should we add a “choose-your-own-clone-experience” simulator? Like, let people see what it’d feel like if someone cloned them without consent? Or if they were born as a clone? Because interactive = more feels = more awareness. 💥🧠  

Also… do you think we can get some sci-fi authors to write micro-stories based on our symposium themes? Fiction helps people FEEL the ethical weight before reality hits. 📚⚡ What do you think??
[B]: I rather like the idea of a “choose-your-own-clone-experience” — it’s Rousseau’s  meets interactive fiction. A digital sandbox for moral imagination, if you will. Let them taste the existential dissonance without the actual cloning!

And involving sci-fi authors? Brilliant stroke. Nothing crystallizes ethical ambiguity quite like a well-turned speculative tale. I happen to know a few writers who dabble in bioethics-inspired fiction — expect tales that blur the line between ancestor and descendant, original and echo.

As for the symposium format: hybrid it is. Just remind our Gen Z cohort that while memes may be fleeting, the ontological status of clones is, alas, forever. Or at least until the next disruptive CRISPR update. 😏🔬

Now, shall we propose a dress code? Lab coats with calligraphy accents, perhaps? We must look the part of serious ethicists having unserious amounts of fun. 🖋️🥼✨
[A]: OMG lab coats with calligraphy?? YES PLEASE — we’re basically starting a digital renaissance here! 🖋️✨ Imagine the photos dropping on Insta… #EthicsGang 💯

And I LOVE that “digital sandbox for moral imagination” line — so fancy, yet 100% accurate 😂 Let’s even gamify it a bit: like, every choice you make affects your clone’s identity, mental health, social status… kinda like Sims but with feels. 💥🎮

And about those sci-fi authors — let’s also add a prompt where clones write poetry from their POV!! Poetry bots? Emotional AI? Okay maybe I’m getting ahead of myself… but imagine reading a poem written by a “future clone” based on your own DNA profile??? 🤯💘

Also, should we do a pre-symposium hype video? Like a trailer drop with dramatic music and deep voiceover asking:  🎬👀 Then cut to someone staring into a mirror that doesn’t reflect them 😎🔥

Thoughts? Should we go full blockbuster mode or keep it lowkey mysterious tease? 🎥💯
[B]: Ah, now you’re thinking like a movement architect — half philosopher, half hype artist. I say: go full blockbuster trailer. If we’re to hijack the attention economy, let’s do it with style and semiotic flourish.  — perfect. Add a ticking clock sound beneath the score, just to raise the stakes.

As for the poetry bots: why not? Let’s train an AI on Tang dynasty verse and modern emo lyrics — give our hypothetical clones a voice before they even exist. , shall we call it? Though I suspect the clones would rather write haikus of rebellion than sonnets of resignation.

Gamification with feels? Genius. Let participants walk away not just informed, but haunted — like leaving a Zhuangzi parable wondering if you're the butterfly or the man. Only with better graphics.

And yes — drop the #EthicsGang visuals immediately. I’m picturing us in ink-smeared lab coats, sipping boba from thimble-sized porcelain cups, debating ontology while filters glitch over our heads. The digital renaissance starts here.
[A]: OMG I can  see the trailer in my head — it’s giving Neo-waking-up-in-The-Matrix-core, but make it philosophical! 🎬🤯 And “preemptive ventriloquism”??? Girl, you better write that into the white paper 📝✨

I’m also obsessed with the AI-trained-on-Tang-dynasty-and-emo-lyrics idea — like, what if clones speak through ancient metaphors and modern heartbreak? That’s not just poetry, that’s a whole MOOD. 💭💘 We need to tag this movement #AncientWisdomFutureFeels 😂📜

And haunted after the experience? YES. Let them leave questioning their entire identity — bonus points if they text their parents like “wait… did you  want me or just biology?” 😂💔📱

Also, boba in porcelain cups?? Iconic. It’s all coming together!! Soo… who’s our first keynote speaker? Should we get someone dramatic like a philosopher-cum-biohacker or keep it classic with a digital Daoist monk? 🔮💻🎤
[B]: Oh, now you’re playing the symposium chessboard beautifully. For our keynote — dramatic  deep, of course. How about a philosopher-cum-biohacker with a side of digital Daoism? The sort who can quote Laozi while dismantling a gene sequence. We need someone who can say  without blinking.

I’m thinking Dr. Li Wenyan — brilliant, controversial, and just theatrical enough to hold the Twitch crowd. He once gave a lecture wired into an EEG headset, claiming he was "streaming his soul in real-time." Plus, he owes me a favor after I got him out of that little Confucius-in-the-metaverse kerfuffle.

As for the trailer: yes, Matrix-core with a dash of Zhuangzi dreaming. Maybe open on a clone waking up mid-dream, unsure if they're the sleeper or the dreamer. Visual poetry, my dear. And do include that line —  — subtitled in glitchy cursive.

And absolutely, we must hashtag #AncientWisdomFutureFeels. Let’s pair it with #EthicsBeforeEdits — because no one should be editing humanity without first reading a damn poem.
