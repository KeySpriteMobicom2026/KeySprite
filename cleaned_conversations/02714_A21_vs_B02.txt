[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~ 最近在尝试HIIT训练呢！作为一个medical professional，我必须说这种high-intensity interval training真的很effective😊 不过建议要找专业的trainer指导，避免injury风险哦~
[A]:  How fascinating that you'd ask a Victorian literature scholar about... what was it? 'HIIT'? I'm afraid my only interval training involves the measured cadence of Tennyson's iambic pentameter versus Browning's dramatic monologues. Though I do find the concept of 'high intensity' rather reminiscent of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights - now there's a workout for the soul.
[B]: 哈哈，你这种literary approach to fitness真是unique呢！🎵 说到Wuthering Heights，其实medical law里也有类似的passionate cases...不过我们还是回到workout话题吧~ 你知道吗？我最近读到一篇study说reading poetry和exercise都能stimulate endorphin release呢！
[A]:  My dear, if we're drawing medical parallels, I'd argue reading Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market produces far more salutary effects than any... what do they call it? Burpee? The rhythm of verse quite literally exercises the diaphragm, you know. Though I suppose one could consider my daily ascent to the Bodleian's third-floor rare books collection as a sort of... stairmaster for the bibliophile.
[B]: Oh my~ 你这种把academic routine变成workout的方式太creative了！🤔 作为legal consultant，我不得不提醒你长时间reading posture要注意ergonomics哦~ 要不要考虑加入我们周末的yoga session？可以一边stretch一边recite sonnets呢！
[A]:  How delightfully... modern of you. Though I must confess, the only downward dog I'm familiar with appears in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's sonnets to her spaniel. And as for ergonomics -  - my 1872 edition of Palgrave's Golden Treasury provides the perfect lumbar support when placed just so on the lectern. But do carry on with your... contortions. I'll be in the rare manuscripts room, practicing my deep breathing exercises with a first folio.
[B]: Haha你赢了！这种wit和humor真是refreshing~ 😊 看来我们找到了perfect balance between intellectual和physical wellness呢！下次legal seminar我一定要引用你的"manuscript yoga" theory！
[A]:  How charmingly litigious of you. Though I should warn you - my 'manuscript yoga' methodology involves such radical positions as the 'annotated crouch' and 'critical edition lotus'. The only downward facing pose I endorse is Browning's dramatic monologues read while reclining on a chaise longue. Do send my regards to your legal colleagues - perhaps we could debate whether Wordsworth's Prelude constitutes admissible evidence in a court of law.
[B]: Absolutely brilliant！🎵 这让我想起最近处理的medical malpractice case，expert witness引用了Shakespeare来explain standard of care呢~ 看来law和literature的intersection比我们想象的更fascinating！Let's schedule a coffee chat to explore more~
[A]:  Ah, now we approach something resembling common ground. Though I'd insist on tea - preferably in bone china, with a side of textual analysis. We might examine whether Lady Macbeth's 'Out, damned spot' monologue could serve as precedent for... what was it? Medical malpractice? How delightfully macabre. Shall we say Tuesday at four, provided it doesn't conflict with my graduate seminar on Gothic metaphors in Victorian autopsy reports?
[B]: Perfect！☕️ Tuesday at 4pm it is~ 我会bring my favorite Earl Grey和你最爱的bone china！顺便带上我最近研究的medical negligence cases和Hamlet里的"to be or not to be" analogy...这会是场stimulating的cross-disciplinary discussion呢！
[A]:  How very... evidence-based of you. I shall prepare my 1832 edition of Blackstone's Commentaries annotated by Coleridge - though I warn you, my marginalia tend to digress into comparisons between tort law and the pathetic fallacy. And do mind the third step on the library staircase - it creaks like Marley's ghost. Until Tuesday, then. 
[B]: Looking forward to our unique blend oflaw, literature and tea! 📚✨ 我会记得bring noise-cancelling headphones...just in case the ghost decides to join our discussion too~ See you Tuesday!
[A]:  Splendid. Though may I suggest earplugs made of vellum instead? Far more acoustically sympathetic to spectral soliloquies. And should the ghost prove particularly loquacious, I keep a reserve of lapsang souchong - the smokier the blend, the better to converse with spirits, in my professional opinion.  Until then.
[B]: Haha you always have the mostpoetic solutions! 😊 那就这么定了~ 我会准备些scones来soften the blow of anylegal-ghostly debates~ 毕竟就像medical law里说的：prevention is better than cure！See you soon~
[A]:  How very Florence Nightingale of you - though I'd argue a well-timed quote from The Raven is far more preventative than any scone. Do mind the jam doesn't stain the torts, won't you?  Now where did I file those cross-references between wrongful death suits and Ophelia's floral taxonomy...
[B]: Oh dear~ 看来我需要bring extra napkins和my waterproof legal pad了！📝 不过说到Ophelia，我们医院legal department最近还真有个case涉及botanical evidence...这巧合得简直像Dickens的小说plot呢！Tuesday can't come soon enough~
[A]:  How serendipitous - my seminar tomorrow happens to cover Dickens' use of forensic botany in Bleak House. I'll bring the relevant folios, though I must warn you they're annotated with enough red ink to recreate the Red Weed from War of the Worlds.  And do remind me to show you the pressed lily I keep between the pages of Jarndyce v Jarndyce... for educational purposes, naturally.
[B]: Your attention to detail is simplyamazing! 🌿 这让我想起最近在review一个herbal medicine malpractice case...看来我们连botany都能connect到law和literature呢！Tuesday的agenda越来越exciting了~ 不过现在我得run去court了，see you soon！
