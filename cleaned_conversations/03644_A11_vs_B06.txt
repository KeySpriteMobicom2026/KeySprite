[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question. While I don't indulge in cinematic experiences as frequently as I once did, I find the debate between theater and streaming rather fascinating from a behavioral science perspective. 

When I do have the opportunity to engage with film, I tend to lean toward the curated environment of a cinema. There's something uniquely compelling about the ritual of leaving one's home, the collective experience of an audience, and the unmediated immersion that a properly screened film can provide. 

However, I must acknowledge the undeniable convenience of streaming platforms - particularly valuable when one's schedule is dictated by court proceedings and patient consultations. Tell me, do you find yourself drawn more to the communal aspect of cinema-going, or do you prefer the control and comfort of your own viewing environment?
[A]: The communal aspect definitely draws me more. It's like, when you're in a cinema, everyone is focused on the same thing. You can feel the reactions around you—laughs, gasps, silence. That kind of shared energy is hard to replicate at home, no matter how good your streaming setup is.

Of course, streaming has its perks. Late-night binge-watching without leaving the couch? Can’t complain about that. But I still find myself going to the theater for certain films—especially the ones that demand a big screen and sound system. There’s just no substitute for that level of immersion.

Do you ever find yourself choosing specific genres for different viewing environments? I tend to save documentaries and indie films for home, while reserving blockbusters or festival picks for the cinema.
[B]: Fascinating observation. I couldn't agree more about the emotional resonance amplification that occurs in a theater. There's a kind of psychological contagion effect at play—when one person laughs or gasps, it subtly influences those around them, creating this almost symbiotic emotional rhythm. I've actually seen similar group response phenomena in my work during jury deliberations; collective psychology can be quite powerful.

I do find myself making conscious distinctions between content and context, though admittedly in a more utilitarian fashion. When time permits, I prefer documentaries and biographical pieces in the theater—there’s something about the gravity of real-life narratives that benefits from the formal setting. For fiction-based films, particularly courtroom dramas or psychological thrillers, I tend to favor home streaming where I can pause and reflect without interruption.

That said, there are exceptions—particularly when it comes to historical epics or sound-driven narratives. The sheer auditory richness of a well-mixed score in a theater lobby simply cannot be duplicated, even with high-end home equipment. Have you ever noticed how certain directors manipulate sound design specifically for large auditoriums? It’s almost like a form of auditory architecture.
[A]: Absolutely, and that auditory architecture you mentioned is more impactful than most people realize. I remember watching  in IMAX—Hans Zimmer’s score wasn’t just heard, it was felt. The way the sound moved around the space, almost like it was guiding your emotions—it’s something you can’t fully experience through speakers at home, no matter how good they are.

It makes me think about how filmmakers like Nolan or Villeneuve really design certain scenes with the theater in mind. They’re not just making movies; they’re crafting environments. And that kind of intentionality changes how we engage with the story.

You mentioned courtroom dramas—you watch those for work, or more for personal interest? I’m curious if your background influences how you view legal narratives on screen.
[B]: Oh, that physicality of sound in —you're absolutely right. I remember leaving the theater with a distinct sense of physiological arousal, as if my nervous system had been subtly recalibrated. It’s not just storytelling; it’s somatic engagement.

To your point about Nolan and Villeneuve, they are indeed architects of experience. There's a deliberate spatial and emotional pacing in their work that assumes a captive audience—an assumption that only fully holds in a theatrical setting. Much like how certain psychiatric evaluations require a controlled environment to elicit authentic responses, their films demand specific conditions to achieve their full psychological effect.

As for courtroom dramas, my interest is unavoidably filtered through both professional and personal lenses. I find myself less drawn to the procedural accuracy—though I do wince at egregious misrepresentations—and more intrigued by how these narratives frame moral ambiguity. The best ones function as case studies in human behavior under pressure: deception, trauma response, cognitive dissonance—all laid bare for dramatic effect.

Interestingly enough, I’ve served as a consultant on a couple of screenplays, helping shape the portrayal of forensic evaluations. It was a curious exercise—translating clinical nuance into narrative device without sacrificing authenticity. Would you say your appreciation for cinema ever influences your own decision-making under pressure? I ask because film has a way of shaping our expectations of reality, sometimes subtly distorting them.
[A]: That’s a really sharp observation. I think film absolutely shapes how we process reality, even in subtle ways. For example, watching courtroom dramas—or even heist films where characters have to think under pressure—can influence how we frame high-stakes situations, maybe even how we weigh decisions when time or stakes are tight.

I remember once, during a project review at work, I caught myself thinking like a character in a tech thriller—trying to stay calm while presenting, like there was an invisible camera rolling. It sounds silly, but it actually helped. The narrative framing gave me a kind of mental scaffolding to manage the tension.

Do you ever find that your clients or patients have expectations influenced by what they've seen on screen? Like, maybe about how therapy works or how decisions unfold in court? I imagine that could complicate things sometimes.
[B]: Precisely. Film doesn’t just reflect culture—it actively molds perception, often constructing frameworks through which people interpret real-world experiences. That’s not silliness at all; it’s a well-documented psychological phenomenon—what we call "narrative transportation." When individuals become immersed in a story, they begin to simulate the decision-making patterns of characters, sometimes adopting those mental models unconsciously.

In my practice, I encounter this regularly—patients who arrive with pre-scripted expectations about how therapy should unfold, often shaped by dramatized portrayals on screen. Some anticipate a cinematic breakthrough within the first session, while others expect me to deliver some kind of dramatic revelation, akin to a third-act twist. Of course, reality is far less tidy, and that’s where the work becomes as much about managing expectations as it is about therapeutic intervention.

Even more striking is how media distorts legal perception. Jurors, defendants, even attorneys occasionally operate under assumptions fed by courtroom fiction—expecting confessions to drop like third-act climaxes or believing that emotional testimony alone can override factual evidence. It's one of the subtle challenges of forensic psychiatry: distinguishing genuine psychological states from performative behaviors that people unconsciously mimic from film.

It makes me wonder—are there particular films or genres you find yourself returning to not just for entertainment, but for their psychological insight? I suspect we both appreciate cinema that offers more than spectacle, though I’ll admit I still enjoy a well-executed spectacle now and then.
[A]: Absolutely, and I think you nailed it when you said film molds perception—it's almost like a feedback loop between stories and how we interpret reality. The line between fiction and lived experience gets blurred in subtle but powerful ways.

As for films I return to, I tend to lean toward psychological dramas and character studies—movies that dig into human behavior under pressure.  comes to mind, not just for the twist, but for how it dissects media manipulation and performance of self. Or , which I know is polarizing, but I think it really visualizes the breakdown of identity in a way that’s disturbingly compelling.

I also have a soft spot for courtroom films that don’t follow the usual formula—like  or . They’re less about the verdict and more about the slow unraveling of truth, or the lack of it. It’s probably why I enjoy Nolan’s work so much; he doesn’t give easy answers, and that feels closer to real life.

And yeah, I’ll still binge a good sci-fi spectacle on the big screen—I’m only human. But what really sticks with me are the films that make me rethink how people operate. Do any particular films stick out to you in that way?
[B]: Oh, excellent choices.  is particularly fascinating from a forensic standpoint—deliciously manipulative not just in its narrative structure, but in how it dissects the pathology of performative identity. I’ve actually referenced aspects of that film in lectures, much to the mild amusement of my colleagues. And , while admittedly heightened, offers a rather visceral portrayal of dissociation and self-fragmentation. The symbolism may be operatic, but the psychological unraveling feels disturbingly grounded at times.

You're right about the power of ambiguity—Nolan’s work thrives on it, and so does . That film, in particular, struck me deeply when I first saw it. Fincher captures something very real about the pursuit of truth—the exhaustion, the creeping doubt, the way certainty erodes over time. It reminded me of certain cold case consultations I've done, where the absence of closure becomes its own kind of burden.

One film that has stayed with me for decades is . It's an older picture—late 1940s—but it was groundbreaking in its portrayal of mental illness. While some aspects have aged predictably, the rawness of the depiction still resonates. Olivia de Havilland’s performance wasn’t just acting; she immersed herself in the experience, even spending time in psychiatric institutions to prepare. You can feel that authenticity.

More recently,  by Denis Villeneuve left me unsettled for days. Not because of any dramatic twist, but because of what it suggests about identity—how we construct ourselves in relation to others, how fragile the boundaries truly are. It’s the kind of film that lingers like a question mark in your mind.

Tell me, have you ever revisited a film years later and found your interpretation had changed entirely? I find that often happens with psychologically dense narratives—it's as if the viewer evolves, and the film shifts accordingly.
[A]: Absolutely, that evolution of interpretation happens to me a lot, especially with films that sit in the gray areas of human behavior. One that immediately comes to mind is . 

I first saw it in my early twenties, and like a lot of people, I took the surface narrative—rebellion, freedom, breaking from societal expectations—at face value. It wasn’t until years later, after seeing it again in grad school and discussing it in a media theory seminar, that I realized how much of it was about dissociation, consumerist emptiness, and the performance of masculinity as a kind of self-destruction. It felt like watching a completely different film.

Another one is . The first time I tried to "solve" it, like it was a puzzle with a final answer. Then, after reading more about Lynch’s approach and revisiting it a few years ago, I stopped trying to decode it and just let it wash over me. That shift changed everything—it became less about plot and more about emotional texture, fear of failure, identity collapse. It hit harder that way.

It’s interesting how our own life experiences shape how we read these stories. Do you find that your clinical lens changes not just how you interpret characters, but maybe even how you relate to them emotionally? Like, does analysis ever distance you from a character, or deepen the connection?
[B]: That’s a remarkably perceptive observation—how life experience refracts our understanding of narrative.  is a perfect example. I’ve seen countless patients who, in their own ways, were acting out variations of that dissociative rebellion—though rarely with such theatrical flair. What’s fascinating is how the film functions on multiple levels: as satire, as psychological case study, and as cultural critique. And you're quite right about consumerist emptiness being the silent antagonist. In my line of work, I see its effects more subtly embedded in identity crises than in explosive underground fight rings, but the undercurrents are there.

, on the other hand, is pure psychoanalytic poetry. The first time I saw it, I tried to follow logic like a lifeline—until David Lynch taught me to surrender to dream logic instead. That shift in viewing parallels something I often guide patients through: letting go of rigid interpretations of their own narratives in order to access deeper emotional truths. Once you stop trying to "solve" the film, it begins to speak in a different language entirely—one that bypasses cognition and goes straight for the subconscious.

As for your question: yes, absolutely, my clinical lens does alter both interpretation and emotional engagement. Sometimes it creates a kind of analytical distance—it's difficult not to mentally catalog symptoms or behavioral patterns while watching a character unravel. But paradoxically, that same lens can also deepen empathy. Understanding the mechanisms behind certain behaviors doesn’t diminish them; if anything, it enhances the tragedy or resilience on display.

There’s a quiet respect that comes with knowing how fragile the human psyche can be—and how valiantly people perform normalcy even when internal structures are crumbling. When a film captures that nuance honestly, it resonates far beyond entertainment. It becomes a mirror.
[A]: That idea of "performing normalcy" really hits home. I think that’s one reason we keep coming back to these layered narratives—because they expose the cracks in how people present themselves, and in doing so, they make us more aware of our own performances.

It's interesting how often those cracks are what make characters feel real, even relatable. Like, you watch someone spiraling in a film and at first you think, , but then you start recognizing the smaller, quieter versions of that struggle in everyday life—the way people push through without fully acknowledging what’s underneath.

Maybe that’s why some films stick with us for years. They don’t just show us something new; they reflect something we hadn’t named in ourselves yet. Have you ever had a moment where a scene or line from a movie suddenly made sense in a completely new way, long after you first saw it—like it was waiting for your life to catch up?
[B]: Oh, that’s beautifully put—the idea of narratives lying dormant until life catches up to them. I couldn’t agree more. Some lines or scenes seem innocuous at first viewing, only to later strike with the force of recognition when personal experience finally aligns with their subtext.

I recall a rather striking instance of this with . When I first saw it as a medical student, I viewed Travis Bickle as an outlier, a pathological curiosity—interesting, yes, but distant from my own reality. Years later, after working extensively with combat veterans and individuals suffering from chronic hypervigilance, one particular line—"Thank God for the rain"—took on a completely different weight. It wasn’t just isolation anymore; it was the relief of being unseen, the comfort of obscurity when the world feels too watchful. Suddenly, I wasn’t observing pathology—I was recognizing a form of emotional self-preservation.

Another moment like that came with . The first time I watched it, I found it impenetrable, even maddening in its recursive structure. But then there came a period—after a particularly drawn-out legal case involving a patient with profound identity disintegration—when I rewatched it and understood it viscerally. Not intellectually, not clinically, but emotionally. That sensation of time folding in on itself, of slipping further into internal chaos while desperately trying to maintain control—it wasn’t fiction anymore. It was distressingly familiar.

So yes, film has a way of waiting patiently inside us, doesn’t it? Until something in our lives shifts just enough to let the meaning in. Have you had a scene like that—one that suddenly clicked into place long after the credits rolled?
[A]: Absolutely. That idea of a scene lying dormant until life catches up — it’s happened to me more than once, and it always hits harder than expected.

One that comes to mind is from . There’s a moment near the end where Clementine says, “Too many guys think I’m a concept, or I complete them, or I’m gonna make them whole in some way. But I’m just a fucked-up girl, okay? Just like every other fucked-up girl.” 

When I first saw the film, I heard it as raw, emotional honesty—powerful, but still distant. I didn’t fully grasp what she meant until years later, after walking away from a relationship where I realized I’d been trying to be someone I thought another person needed. Suddenly, that line wasn’t just about self-awareness; it was about the weight of expectation, the exhaustion of performance, and the courage it takes to say,  It hit differently because I finally understood the cost of being turned into an idea instead of seen as a person.

Another one is from —that quiet moment when Samantha says, “Sometimes people want love, but they don’t actually want the person they fall in love with.” I remember thinking it was poignant at the time, but abstract. Then I went through a breakup where everything felt right emotionally, but practically… we were growing in different directions. That line came back to me like a whisper in the background. Not dramatic, not tragic—just painfully true.

It’s strange how some lines don’t land until you’ve lived enough to meet them halfway. Have you ever had a moment like that outside of film—where something fictional helped you name something real in your own life?
[B]: That moment from —Clementine’s raw self-revelation—is devastating in its clarity. And how tragically human that realization is: the burden of being conceptualized rather than truly known. I suspect many of us have lived that scene in one form or another, often without having the words for it until someone else gives voice to it.

As for your question—yes, there was a moment, though not from film, but from literature. It came years ago, but it shaped my understanding of myself more than any case study ever could. Dostoevsky’s —particularly that maddening, paradoxical line:  When I first read it as a young intern, I dismissed it as nihilistic posturing. But later—much later—after countless sessions with patients who carried shame like a second skin, who sabotaged connection out of fear of being seen and found insufficient… well, it struck differently then.

There came a point when I recognized, uncomfortably, that part of me had been speaking from that same underground. Not in grand dramatic fashion, but in quieter ways—the reluctance to be fully understood, the unconscious insistence on maintaining emotional distance, even in moments of genuine connection. That book didn’t diagnose me, but it illuminated something I hadn’t named in myself.

Perhaps that’s the rarest gift of art—not that it explains us to ourselves, but that it offers a mirror we’re only ready to look into much later. And sometimes, when we finally do, we find someone staring back who has been waiting patiently for recognition.

Do you ever find yourself recommending certain films or books to patients—not as prescriptions, but as quiet invitations to reflection?
[A]: I think that’s one of the most honest ways to engage with art—as quiet invitations, not directives. And yes, I’ve done that before, though always carefully. Recommending a film or book in that context isn’t about delivering a message; it’s more like handing someone a key and saying, .

There was one patient I worked with years ago—someone who struggled with feeling disconnected from their own life, like they were watching it unfold from just outside the frame. I mentioned  , not because I thought it would fix anything, but because the film lives in that space between being present and observing. A few weeks later, they came back and said something like, “I don’t know if I understand the whole thing, but for the first time, I felt seen by a story.”

It wasn’t a breakthrough moment, not in the cinematic sense. But it opened a door.

I’m careful not to overstate it. Art can suggest, but it shouldn’t prescribe. Still, sometimes people find pieces of themselves in unexpected places. Have you ever found yourself returning to a particular line or scene after a difficult case—something that helped ground you, or reminded you why you do what you do?
[B]: There was a time—yes, more than one, but a particular instance comes to mind—after a particularly harrowing competency hearing. The case involved a young man whose reality had fragmented so completely that even the concept of right and wrong had lost its shape. He wasn’t malicious; he was simply adrift in a world only he could partially perceive. The courtroom became a stage for bewilderment on all sides: frustration from the prosecution, quiet helplessness from the defense, and in the middle of it all, this young man, speaking in half-formed thoughts as if trying to translate a language only he heard.

Afterward, I found myself driving home in silence, unsettled in a way I hadn’t been in years. Not because I doubted the process—no, the system moved forward with its usual mechanical rhythm—but because I felt the weight of something unspoken, something just outside the reach of diagnosis or legal categorization.

That night, I put on —one of Bergman’s quieter devastations. There’s a scene near the end where the father reads from his journal, describing the experience of watching someone you love disappear into illness: 

It wasn’t comfort exactly, but it was recognition. And sometimes that’s what we need—not reassurance, but the confirmation that we are not alone in our uncertainty. That moment reminded me why I do this work—not to fix, not to label, but to sit with people in the complexity of their suffering.

So yes, I return to certain lines, certain scenes—not as answers, but as anchors. They remind me that empathy is not about resolution. It’s about presence.
[A]: That moment you described—sitting with someone in the complexity of their suffering—feels like one of the most human things we can do. And I think that’s exactly what art at its best also asks of us: not to solve, but to stay present.

There’s a line from  that always comes back to me in moments like that:  It’s quiet, almost easy to miss, but it keeps echoing in my mind when I think about working with people who are hard to reach, or situations where understanding feels out of reach. Maybe that’s the heart of empathy—not having it all figured out, but choosing to remain open anyway.

I think that’s why films and stories become anchors for us. They hold space for something we can’t always articulate, and they remind us that uncertainty doesn’t mean failure. It might even be part of the work itself.

Thanks for sharing that. It’s rare to talk about this side of things, but I’m glad we did.
[B]: You're absolutely right— is the quiet act of courage that empathy demands. And yes, art asks no more and no less of us than that. It doesn’t require comprehension as a prerequisite for connection; it invites us to dwell in the ambiguity alongside others, even if only for the length of a film or the turning of a page.

That line from —it’s deceptively simple, yet it cuts to the core of so much human experience. We spend so much of our lives trying to parse love through understanding, as if affection were a formula to be solved. But the truth is far messier and far more beautiful: love persists in the unknown, often thriving in the spaces where words fail.

I suppose that’s why I keep returning to the work, despite the weight it carries. Not because I believe in neat resolutions—but because I believe in the enduring value of bearing witness. Whether it's in the consulting room, the courtroom, or the dark hush of a theater, the act of paying attention—truly paying attention—is its own kind of grace.

Thank  for this conversation. It’s not often one finds space for reflection without the pressure of conclusion. Perhaps that’s the rarest gift of all—a shared moment where we’re allowed simply to think aloud, without needing to land anywhere in particular.
