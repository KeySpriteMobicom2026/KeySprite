[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I've always been fascinated by the language of cinema – you know, how a single frame can speak volumes. But if we're talking about actual spoken languages... I'd say I'm intrigued by Mandarin. There's something poetic about its tones, like musical notes shaping meaning.  

Let me tell you a story – back when I produced that indie flick in Taipei, I remember sitting through dailies and being mesmerized by how subtle shifts in pronunciation changed entire meanings. It was like watching magic unfold phonetically.  

That said, do you know what really fascinates me? How certain phrases just don't translate well across cultures. Like that famous Wong Kar-wai line – it loses something when dubbed. Ever noticed that?
[A]: Ah, the alchemy of cinema and language – I couldn't agree more. There's something about Mandarin's tonal architecture that turns speech into symphony. Funny you mention untranslatable phrases...  

I once had a patient from Chengdu who described depression as "losing one's autumn." Beautiful, isn't it? Like melancholy is simply misplacing seasonal awareness. Tries to explain it in English during court testimony once – judge thought he was talking about horticulture!  

Though I must say, after thirty years of forensic psychiatry, I've come to believe some things  remain untranslatable. Certain nuances protect us, don't they? Like how we say "diminished capacity" instead of admitting madness lives in all our heads rent-free sometimes.  

But tell me – what phrase in Mandarin do you think absolutely refuses translation? The one that haunts you like a shot Wong Kar-wai never quite got right?
[B]: "losing one's autumn"... God, that's hauntingly beautiful. Reminds me of how we sometimes shoot scenes knowing they'll never make the final cut - just ghosts lingering in the editing suite.  

Funny you should ask about untranslatables... There's this phrase I picked up from my location manager in Beijing – "心碎成慢镜头" (). Literally "heartbreak in slow motion". We were scouting locations after a particularly brutal breakup of mine, and she just looked at me and said it like she'd seen the whole thing play out frame by frame.  

Try explaining that to a studio exec! They wanted to market it as "tragic romance" but hell, it's not just romance - it's that aching realization that things broke too beautifully to ever fix. Ever seen that happen on set? When two actors' chemistry implodes but leaves behind this... cinematic residue?  

Actually, now that I think about it, maybe that's why Wong Kar-wai films resonate so deeply. He doesn't just film love - he shoots heartbreak at 24 frames per second, letting each tone linger like an unresolved chord.
[A]: Heartbreak in slow motion...  You know, I had a patient once – brilliant screenwriter – who described delusional thinking as "falling in love with your own shadows."  

Struck me how similar that feels to what you're saying. I've seen that residue you mention on set – not just between actors, but in the spaces between takes. The way someone holds a gaze half a heartbeat too long after "cut," like their soul hasn't quite exited the scene.  

Funny thing is, I find myself prescribing Wong Kar-wai films these days. Not the pills Big Pharma pushes, but a carefully curated dosage of  or . There's therapy in watching beautifully broken things unfold without tidy resolutions.  

But tell me honestly – when you shot in Taipei, did you ever catch yourself falling for the city before the people? I swear every alleyway there hums with some forgotten screenplay waiting to be resurrected.
[B]: Ah, that alleyway hum –  – I’ll never forget it. It’s like the city itself was whispering its secrets through every flickering neon sign. We shot this one scene at 3 a.m. in a night market, and honestly? The dumpling vendors were giving better performances than half the actors I’ve worked with.  

But falling for the city first? Damn right I did. Taipei seduced me before I even met my own lead actress. There’s something about the way dawn breaks over Elephant Mountain – all those sleepy storefronts coming alive like they’re rehearsing for a Chien-Hung Luo film. Even the rain there feels cinematic, like it’s only drizzling because the script calls for melancholy.  

Funny story – during post-production, my editor kept asking why I lingered on that one shot of a stray cat crossing a street. I told him, “That cat’s got more screen presence than our love interest.” He didn’t speak to me for a week.  

You know what it is though? Cities like Taipei don’t just . They perform. And we – filmmakers, lovers, madmen – just try to keep up.
[A]:  You've nailed it – cities as performers. Reminds me of a case I had years back. A delusional architect who swore he could hear London's buildings whispering plot points. Said the city was auditioning him for some grand production he didn't quite understand.  

But Taipei... yes, it does seduce. Almost pathologically. I had a patient once develop full-blown derealization after filming there. Kept insisting the sidewalks were tracking shots, like Wong Kar-wai had rewired her nervous system with 35mm film.  

That editor of yours sounds like my former chief resident – all surgical precision, no tolerance for cinematic poetry. Though honestly? That cat probably  have better timing. Ever notice how animals in Asian cities just seem more... present? Like they’re the only ones aware of the fourth wall?  

Funny you mention Chien-Hung Luo – I’ve prescribed his films to patients struggling with existential ennui. One woman started seeing halos around streetlights for weeks afterward. Said the world looked “more honest” that way.  

You ever find yourself diagnosing characters while watching dailies? I catch myself scribbling DSM-5 codes in margins sometimes. "Exhibitionist tendencies – see: neon-soaked night market scene."
[B]:  Oh god, I love that – diagnosing characters like we’re some kind of cinematic psychiatrists. You know, I once had a script consultant quit because I insisted my lead character wasn’t just melancholic – she was clinically derealized. “Too on-brand for arthouse,” he said. Can you believe that?  

But your patient with the halos? That’s gold. Honestly, if Chien-Hung Luo doesn’t get an honorary degree in clinical psychology soon, I’m starting a petition. His films don’t just show loneliness – they make it . I remember watching  and suddenly feeling nostalgic for places I’d never even been. Isn’t that messed up? Like emotional plagiarism.  

And yes – animals! I swear, every time we shot near a temple or market, the cats and crows were basically co-producers. One rooster in particular – this magnificent bastard strutting through a night market scene like he owned the damn frame. Gave me three perfect takes before deciding to crow directly into the lens. Still gives me chills.  

DSM-5 codes in the margins? Oh, now you're speaking my language. Last year I boxed a director because he kept cutting away from a character’s hands during monologues. Turns out, the guy had a minor tremor. Didn’t realize until dailies – subtle signs of early-stage Parkinson’s. Ended up writing it into the role. Funny how truth sneaks in through the cracks, isn’t it?
[A]:  Ah, the poetry of psychopathology seeping through celluloid... That director you boxed? He was onto something, in a way. I had a patient once – an actor who swore his tremor wasn't Parkinson's, but "performance anxiety from past lives." Tried to convince me it was karmic backlash from too many sword-fighting roles in previous incarnations.  

But that’s the thing with truth, isn’t it? It never announces itself with title cards. Just slips in through wardrobe wrinkles and missed eye-lines. Reminds me of a case I handled – a screenwriter accused of plagiarizing his own delusions. Jury couldn’t tell where the man ended and the script began.  

Say, since we're diagnosing characters... If you had to give one of your films an ICD-10 code, which would it be? Personally, I’d peg your last feature as  All that lingering on empty chairs and half-drunk teacups – classic displacement behavior.  

And don’t even get me started on Chien-Hung Luo’s emotional vectors. One of my interns developed transient depersonalization after watching his trilogy back-to-back. Swears he saw his childhood dog walk through a scene in .
[B]:  Ah, now  the kind of case study they should teach in film school – "Plagiarizing One's Own Delusions." I’d pay good money to see that courtroom psych eval. "Your Honor, the defendant insists he’s not psychotic—just ."  

And your man with the karmic tremor? Classic. I actually cast someone like him once – an old wuxia actor who swore his sword hand remembered every villain it had ever sliced. Told me between takes he could still hear the echo of blood on steel from roles shot decades ago. Gave the performance of his life too – shaky hands and all. Poetic justice, really. His anxiety became the character’s soul.

As for ICD-10 codes… Okay, fine. If you twist my arm, I’ll play. My last film? Yeah, maybe  fits – but only if we tack on a , just for flavor. Because let’s be honest – half those empty chairs were deliberate. I wanted the audience to feel the absence, you know? To sit with the silence like an unwanted guest at a dinner party that ended badly.

And Chien-Hung Luo’s emotional vectors? Oh god, don’t even get me started. That intern of yours isn’t crazy – I swear I saw my ex walk through one of those long takes in . Same coat, same stride. Probably just a lookalike, but hell, for a second I forgot what was real. Felt like I was grieving her all over again – in 24 frames per second.
[A]:  Ah, the sweet perfume of Z76.89 – cinema's favorite guilty pleasure. We psychiatrists call it "factitious disorder," but in your world, isn't it just called Tuesday on set?  

Funny you mention grieving in frames per second... I had a patient once who processed loss through aspect ratios. Widower who swore his late wife only looked real in 4:3. Refused to watch anything wider – said love should always feel slightly cropped, like memories.  

And that wuxia actor of yours?  Reminds me of a case I handled – an elderly stuntman convinced his body was haunted by every character he'd ever doubled for. Said his knees remembered bullet wounds they never sustained. I believed him. Hell, after thirty years in this field, I'm half-convinced my own spine is made of case files and unresolved endings.  

You know what fascinates me most about your kind though? How absence becomes its own character. I've seen psychopaths who leave less behind than an empty chair in one of your frames.  

Tell me honestly – do you ever get nostalgic for scenes that never made the final cut? Like remembering a life you almost lived?
[B]:   

You know, I think about those lost scenes the way some people think about ex-lovers – with this weird mix of regret and gratitude. Like that one sequence in  we shot at dawn in a derelict teahouse… Never made the final edit. But God, every time I close my eyes, I can still see it – steam curling off a cold porcelain cup, shadows stretching like they’re trying to escape the room. It haunts me more because no one else ever got to witness it.

And your widower with the 4:3 grief? Jesus. That’s not delusion – that’s devotion. Maybe we should start prescribing aspect ratios instead of SSRIs. “Take two frames of 1.33 and call me in the morning.”  

As for absence… Yeah. It’s the unsung star of every film I’ve ever made. You sculpt presence by what you leave out. A door left ajar. A cigarette that burns too long without being smoked. Those are the things that linger in the audience’s bones long after the credits roll.

But that stuntman of yours? His knees remembering wounds they never had… That’s not madness. That’s empathy on a cellular level. Hell, I think we’re all haunted by roles we almost played, lives we almost lived, people we almost loved. Isn’t that what cinema is? Ghost stories told in flickering light?

I’ll tell you what – next time I cut a scene that deserves better, I’m mailing you the reel. Maybe you can screen it for your patients. Call it . Or hell, maybe just 
[A]:  You know, I’ve got a whole filing cabinet of unfinished business in my office. Old case notes that read like bad screenplays –  Sometimes I think psychiatry’s just another editing suite, trimming excess realities until the narrative flows smoothly.

But your lost scenes? Don’t be too sentimental. Absence is the only truly honest director – it never overdubs emotion or smooths out rough edges. One of my patients used to collect discarded film strips outside a lab near here. Said they whispered to him at night. Turned out he was right – found his own face in a background shot years later. Never got to see the finished film. Died mid-credits.

And that teahouse sequence? Trust me, its ghost lives on in better company than most finished films. I once had a woman in my chair who couldn’t sleep unless she rewound the same three frames of a Wong Kar-wai Blu-ray. Said those seconds contained more truth than her entire marriage. Eventually prescribed her a VHS copy and told her to let it degrade naturally.

Funny thing about wounds we don't carry – I've seen men confess to crimes just to feel the weight of a story. Others erase themselves entirely. Almost makes you wonder which is healthier – haunted by what almost was, or numb from what actually happened?

Say... if you ever do screen those lost reels for therapy, remind me to bring popcorn. There's something deeply human about watching beautiful mistakes flicker back to life, don't you think?
[B]:  Beautiful mistakes... Yeah. That’s exactly what they were.

You know, I think I get it now – why that patient of yours collected discarded film. There’s something sacred about the rejects, isn’t there? Like deleted scenes are just ghosts asking to be remembered. I’ve got a canister in my office still labeled . Never had the heart to splice it back in, even when the studio begged for a director’s cut. It belongs to the silence now.

And that woman with the rewound frames? Christ. I’d call that devotion if it didn’t sound so clinical. Sometimes I wonder if we make films just so people can find pieces of themselves in someone else's subconscious. Like walking into a stranger’s dream and realizing you recognize the furniture.

As for haunted versus numb…  I’ll take haunted any day. At least then you  something, right? The numbness? That’s the real horror. I saw it in actors who'd burned out, in scripts that got rewritten so many times they forgot their original intent. You ever meet someone who used to be their own character but now just recites lines from memory?

And absolutely – bring the popcorn. Hell, bring whiskey too. If we’re screening ghosts, we might as well do it right. Let’s call it  First round’s on me.
[A]:  You know, I keep a similar canister in my office – not film stock, but case files with all identifying details redacted. Patients used to joke it was my version of a director’s cut. One woman insisted I’d spliced her story too tightly, left out the parts where she screamed into pillowshots and forgot her own name.  

But you’re right about haunted spaces – there’s more life in them than most people realize. I had a colleague once who refused to watch horror films, said his job gave him enough ghosts. Fool never understood that horror is just reality with better lighting and a tighter score.  

And that numbness? Oh, I see it daily. Like actors reciting rewritten scripts, you said. Perfect description. Reminds me of a patient I lost last year – he’d been hospitalized so many times, his delusions started echoing other people's psychoses. Eventually couldn’t tell if his paranoia was original or borrowed from some long-departed roommate. Died quoting dialogue from a movie he never saw.  

So yes, haunted wins every time. At least then something still  inside you, even if it hurts.  

Whiskey and popcorn it is. Hell, throw in some incense while we're at it – let’s make it feel like a proper séance. First rule of the club: no closure. Second rule: we only screen endings that refuse to end.  

You’ve got yourself a support group, my friend. Just don’t be surprised when the ghosts start quoting .
[B]:   

To the ghosts who outlive us. To the lines we borrow, the wounds we inherit, and the stories that refuse to stay buried.

You know, I think that lost patient of yours – the one quoting a movie he never saw – that’s the real horror, isn’t it? Not that he was mad, but that somewhere along the way, his own voice got overwritten. Like a film reel spliced with someone else’s ending. Tragic. Beautiful, in a way that hurts to hold.

And your séance idea? Perfect. Let’s light the incense, dim the lights, and let the dead scenes speak. Maybe we’ll screen that  reel next week. Or better yet, loop that one shot of the cat walking through the night market. Hell, he probably had more insight than half our casts.

No closure. No final cuts. Just flickering truths and half-remembered lines. Sounds like the only kind of therapy worth having.

Welcome to , Doc. Popcorn’s on you. Whiskey’s on me. And the ghosts? Well, they’re already here.
[A]:   

To the uncut and the overwritten – may they keep whispering through the static. You're absolutely right about that patient's tragedy. Sometimes I think madness isn't a break from reality, but reality finally demanding royalties for borrowed lines. That poor man... just another ghost in someone else's script.

And don’t get me started on your night market cat. I’ve seen less knowing looks in interns who’ve just read Freud for the first time. There’s wisdom in creatures who walk between worlds without asking permission – something about existing in liminal spaces makes you fluent in languages most people never hear.

I’ll bring the incense. Sandalwood, maybe – clears the mind without burning too hot. Helps when you’re dissecting ghosts frame by frame. And speaking of... remind me to show you a particular reel sometime – , we used to call it. A patient who only spoke in misremembered film quotes. Beautiful monologues, really. Like watching Cassavetes directed by a broken VCR.

No closure. No final diagnoses. Just flickering shadows and unfinished symphonies.

Welcome back to , my friend. The projector’s warming up, and the ghosts are already queueing.
[B]:   

To borrowed lines and overdue royalties – hell, maybe we should start paying residuals to the ghosts who keep our stories alive.  

That night market cat? Oh, he knew something alright. Probably sitting on some rooftop right now, giving dailies to a crowd of alleyway spirits. “Subtext was weak in take three,” he’s probably saying, tail flicking like a metronome counting lost time.  

Sandalwood sounds perfect. Clears the head without forgiving it – exactly what we need when we’re picking through unfinished business and misremembered monologues. And … Christ, I can’t wait. There’s something deeply romantic about a man stitching his soul together with film quotes. Like watching someone rebuild a heart out of discarded dialogue and celluloid scar tissue.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s all we are – a bunch of background extras wearing each other’s memories. Walking between reels and real life like it's nothing.  

Projector’s warm. Ghosts are lined up.  
Let’s see what doesn’t quite make the final cut...  
again.
[A]:   

You hit it right on the head – we’re all just extras wearing borrowed memories like ill-fitting costumes. I had a patient once who insisted he was a walk-on actor in everyone else’s life. Said he could feel the marks on the floor beneath his feet even when he was alone. "I’m always on set," he used to whisper, "even in my sleep."  

And hell, maybe he wasn’t wrong. We move through each other's stories, picking up bits of dialogue like lint from someone else’s coat. Sometimes I wonder if that’s what psychosis really is – not losing touch with reality, but realizing how flimsy the whole damn script is.  

But ... Oh, he was something else. Not just quoting films –  them. One day he’d speak exclusively in Brando riffs, next he’d channel Ingrid Bergman trapped in a feedback loop. Beautiful, really. Like watching a soul trying to hold itself together with movie tickets and cigarette smoke.  

Funny thing is, some of my best insights come not from textbooks, but from patients who’ve completely lost the plot. They see things the rest of us miss – like how grief can mimic infatuation, or how denial makes for great box office.  

So yes – let’s raise another imaginary glass to the flimsy script, the misremembered lines, and the ghosts who keep our reels spliced with meaning.  

Projector’s humming.  
The first frame flickers.  
Let the unfinished begin…  
again.
[B]:   

"To the flimsy script. May it never hold together long enough to disappoint us."

You know, I’ve worked with actors who spent years chasing that fragile feeling – trying to  the character so completely they’d forget their own name. But your man in ? He wasn’t acting. He was surviving. Stitching identity out of old monologues and half-remembered close-ups. Hell, maybe he was the only one who ever got it right.

And that feeling you mentioned – seeing grief masquerade as love, denial pass for hope – yeah. I caught myself editing a scene once where the lead says goodbye to someone who never actually leaves. Cut it three different ways and still couldn’t tell if it was tragic or just... honest. In the end, I left it ambiguous. Audiences hated me for it. Critics called it cowardice. But you know what? That silence between frames? That’s where the truth lives.

So let’s screen it loud and proud – our unfinished symphony of borrowed voices and haunted hearts.

Let the ghosts lean into their lines.  
Let the reel wobble.  
Let the projector hum like a lullaby for things that never quite landed.

Welcome to the cut, Doc.  
We’re finally getting started.
