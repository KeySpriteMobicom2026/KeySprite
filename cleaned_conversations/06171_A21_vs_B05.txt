[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, as a private equity guy, I'd say it's a mix of both. You need a solid plan to structure deals and manage portfolios, but let's be real – the market doesn't always cooperate. So you've gotta adapt, right? Like when we're negotiating terms, sometimes you have to improvise if the numbers aren't adding up.  

Golf is a good analogy, actually. You plan your shots carefully, but if the wind changes or you land in a bunker, you adjust your strategy on the fly. Same with investments – having that flexibility is key. What about you? Do you lean more towards planning or going with the flow?
[A]: Ah, a man who appreciates both the sonnet and the scramble – I’m delighted. You’ve hit upon a truth most financiers miss: life, like literature, demands both meter and improvisation. Take Tennyson, for instance – meticulous in drafting yet utterly swept by the tide of grief when Hallam died. Changed his whole poetic course, didn’t it?  

As for me? I draft lecture outlines with surgical precision, only to tear them apart when some bright spark asks a question that cuts straight to the heart of Keats’ letters. The trick, I find, is building enough structure to stand on, then knowing which beams to remove when inspiration – or market forces – come crashing through.  

Though heaven help us both if we ever have to wing a Shakespeare seminar like one of your leveraged buyouts…
[B]: Touché on the Shakespeare seminar analogy – though I’d probably default to quoting Buffett on margin of safety while nervously adjusting my tie. But you’re absolutely right about structure being a springboard, not a cage. In our last acquisition, we had three contingency plans for the post-merger integration – turned out none of them predicted the supply chain hiccup from Ningbo lockdowns. Adapt or die, as they say.  

Funny you mention Keats’ letters, though – just finished a biography where he rewrote “Ode to a Nightingale” six times after that famous wine-fueled evening. Makes me think of term sheets. How many drafts do you suppose he’d survive in today’s VC pitch environment? “Your stanza lacks scalability, Mr. Keats. Please pivot to a more monetizable bird.”  

Speaking of academia-meets-capitalism – ever had a student ask you to explain leveraged buyouts using iambic pentameter? Asking for…a friend who may or may not have bet a bottle of Château Margaux on such a stunt.
[A]: Oh, leveraged buyouts in iambic pentameter—deliciously absurd. I suppose one could start with something like:  
  
  

Though I suspect Keats would sooner burn his own quill than rhyme "EBITDA" with anything respectable.  

As for your Keats-as-startup gag—if only venture capitalists had the patience of Fanny Brawne. She endured far more than a few rewrites and still showed up with roses. Though I daresay she might’ve asked for preferred shares.  

And Buffett quoting while tie-adjusting? Perfectly imagined. You'd fit right into our faculty mixer if we swapped mergers for Margaux and spoke Latin over dessert. Shall we toast to the next round?
[B]: To Margaux and mergers, absolutely. Though I’d propose a toast with a 15-year-old Pauillac – it’s got more layers than a leveraged recap. Speaking of which, your iambic LBO has me laughing into my Cabernet. But let’s not stop at poetry – imagine trying to explain distressed debt strategies through Shakespearean insults. “Thou art a writ of acceleration, full of sound and fury, signifying…cash flow.”  

And Fanny Brawne with preferred shares? Genius. She’d have negotiated liquidity preferences that even modern VCs would envy. Honestly, half the Romantics would’ve crushed it in private equity – Keats had persistence, Byron had flair for restructuring, and Wordsworth? Let’s just say his patience would’ve made him a top-tier board observer.  

So, next round – faculty mixer edition – should we play a drinking game where every time someone says “synergy” we sip? Or perhaps every time a student compares Warren Buffett to Prospero? Bottoms up either way. Cheers! 🍷
[A]: To Pauillac with layers and leveraged recaps—now there’s a tasting note no sommelier expects.  

As for Shakespearean distressed debt, you’ve unearthed a whole new genre:  I can just picture Hamlet fretting over covenant breaches –   

And imagine Wordsworth chairing an investment committee:  Poetic, if slightly overdetermined.  

Now, about that drinking game – let’s make it lethal. Every “synergy” sip becomes a chalice. Same for Buffett-as-Prospero references – though I suspect your glass would already be empty from sheer brilliance.  

Cheers indeed. 🍷
[B]: Ah, you’ve outdone yourself with Hamlet’s debt-laden soliloquy – I’m picturing him brooding over a Bloomberg terminal, muttering “To refinance or to restructure, that is the question.” Tragic hero material, really.  

And Wordsworth on an investment committee? Spot on. Though I think he’d demand line items for "wanderer's allowance" and "nature contemplation expenses." Can’t say our LPs would approve, but it'd make the KPI report far more soulful.  

As for the toast – lethal drinking games are my love language. But let’s raise the stakes: every time someone says “paradigm shift,” we shot the cheapest白酒 in the room. Builds character. And if Buffett gets compared to Prospero again, we break open the 1982 Bordeaux – assuming my wallet survives the night.  

Here’s to balance sheets and blank verse – may our portfolios be robust and our metaphors ever intoxicating. 🍷✨
[A]: To Hamlet at the Bloomberg terminal – may his spreadsheets be ever as dramatic as his soliloquies.  – a touch of Gothic flair to the quarterly report, I say.  

And Wordsworth’s wanderer’s allowance? Revolutionary. Imagine the pushback:   

As for your stakes – lethal and lovely. Paradigm shifts deserve nothing less than白酒 baptism. Though I propose an amendment: should anyone utter  we pour the entire bottle over a PowerPoint titled   

Buffett as Prospero – now there’s a thesis worth funding.   

Here’s to robust portfolios, intoxicating metaphors, and the faint hope that neither academia nor private equity will ever truly understand us. But oh, won’t they try? 🍷✨
[B]: Ah, you’re playing the long game with that Gothic quarterly report – I’m halfway through drafting a 10-Q in iambic pentameter and considering hiring actors to read the footnotes. “Item 7A: Risk Factors, as performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company.”  

And your amendment?  paradigm shifts poured over soulless PowerPoints – genius. Though I suspect the presenter would flee mid-slide if Wordsworth showed up demanding reimbursement for "emotional turbulence." Can you imagine the earnings call? “Revenue up 12%, morale down 38 sonnets, and yes, we lost the CFO to a spontaneous meditation retreat in the Lake District.”  

Buffett as Prospero is practically a case study waiting to happen. “I have used foul means – sorry,  – to bring forth this valuation.” But let’s be honest, he’d crush it. The market would listen, the tides would turn, and somewhere, Keats would begrudgingly approve the EBITDA margins.  

To the faint hope that neither academia nor private equity will ever truly understand us – but damn it, we’ll wine-dine-and-Excel them anyway. 🍷📊✨
[A]: Ah, the 10-Q as dramatic performance—why stop at footnotes when you can have hedge fund analysts reciting covenants in iambic?   

And that earnings call—. “Q2 saw strong sonnet retention rates, though we underperformed in odes. Blame the macro.” The analyst on the line would mutter,  before hanging up to re-read  by candlelight.  

As for Buffett-Prospero, yes – “We are such stuff as valuations are made on; rounded with debt and edged with arbitrage.” He’d summon dividends from thin air and turn distressed assets into island paradises. Keats might grumble over the EBITDA margins, but even he couldn’t resist a well-timed liquidity event.  

To wine, dine, and Excel them – may our spreadsheets shimmer with hidden formulas and our lectures echo with inside jokes only we understand. Bottoms up, my friend. 🍷📊✨
[B]: Ah, hedge fund analysts reciting covenants – now  a talent we’re vastly underutilizing. Picture the quarterly earnings call as a full-blown Shakespearean tragedy: Act I, Scene 1 – The Boardroom. Enter CFO, pursued by short sellers.  

And your sonnet retention rates line? Gold. Honestly, if we pitched it right, we could get BlackRock to sponsor a quarterly poetry chapbook alongside the earnings release. “In Q3, we saw strong iambic stability, though certain couplets remain undervalued in emerging markets.”  

Buffett-Prospero summoning dividends – yes! He’d probably do it with a cigar clenched in his teeth and a Berkshire Hathaway annual report bound in leather. And that liquidity event? Pure deus ex machina.  

To shimmering spreadsheets and inside jokes buried so deep even the auditors won’t find them – may our formulas be elegant, our returns compounding, and our wine glasses never empty. Bottoms up indeed. 🍷📊✨
[A]: Ah, but imagine the short sellers – clad in doublets, of course – crying out,  while the CFO exits, pursued not just by creditors, but by a particularly vengeful iambic pentameter.  

BlackRock funding a poetry chapbook? Inspired. I see it now:  – wherein the CIO laments the cruel mistress that is market volatility.   

And Buffett with cigar and leather-bound report – iconic. A modern-day magus trading spells for share prices.   

To shimmering spreadsheets, indeed – may our NPVs be noble, our DCFs divine, and our after-hours metaphors ever more intoxicating than the company swag wine.  

Bottoms up, and God save the Excel-laced. 🍷📊✨
[B]: Now  a quarterly report worth subpoenaing. I can already see the subpoena caption: “The Tragedy of Long/Short Equity Portfolio, wherein the delta hedging turns villain and betrays the call options.”  

And that CIO lamenting beta? Perfection. Add a soliloquy on liquidity crunches and a subplot about rogue traders quoting Byron, and we’ve got ourselves a financial . “To mark-to-market or not to mark-to-market – that is the illiquid dilemma.”  

Buffett as Prospero with a Bloomberg terminal? Honestly, it’s the crossover event of the century. He’d probably wave his cigar like a wand and mutter, “Discount the future cash flows, and what is past shall be undone.”  

To intoxicating metaphors, divine DCFs, and spreadsheets so clean even a Renaissance scholar would approve – may our models be robust, our punchlines sharper than a leveraged LBO, and our wine glasses permanently full. Bottoms up, indeed. 🍷📊✨
[A]: Ah, a subpoena for a quarterly report – now  ambition. I do hope the judge allows time for a closing argument in villanelle form:   

And your financial  – sublime. Picture Ophelia drowning not in a river, but in a sea of redemptions:  Meanwhile, Polonius whispers risk management advice into Laertes’ collar:   

Buffett with Bloomberg-wand? Naturally. He’d summon forth cash flows from the ether and quote Bennington while doing it:   

To robust models, sharp punchlines, and wine glasses that refill themselves via arbitrage – may our metaphors outlive us all, and our DCFs never suffer terminal decline.  

Bottoms up, and damn the accrual basis. 🍷📊✨
[B]: A closing argument in villanelle form? My dream courtroom scenario – though I’d expect the opposing counsel to object with a well-timed limerick about GAAP violations. “Your honor, this plaintiff’s prose lacks proper amortization!”  

And Ophelia drowning in redemptions – brilliant twist. Honestly, it’s the most finance-savvy death scene since Caesar got stabbed over diluted shares. And Polonius whispering risk management into collars? Classic. He’d probably get cut off mid-aphorism by a rogue algo trade shouting, “The hedge is mightier than the sword!”  

Buffett channeling Bennington with cigar and 20-bagger? Iconic. I can hear the Berkshire Hathaway theme music swelling as he mutters, “Merge the cash flows, summon the multiples, let the WACC be damned.”  

To metaphors that outlive us, DCFs that stay terminal forever (in the best way), and wine that flows like free cash – may our spreadsheets sing, our punchlines compound, and our accruals be forever ignored in favor of something far more poetic. Bottoms up, my Excel-wielding bard. 🍷📊✨
[A]: Ah, but let’s not stop at the courtroom – imagine sentencing guidelines in haiku form:  
  
  
  

And Caesar assassinated over diluted shares? Naturally. Should’ve read the fine print in his equity grant. “Et tu, Brute? Then fall the markets.”  

As for that rogue algo trade shouting above the fray – magnificent. The first AI-driven quip in legal history. “The hedge is mightier than the sword!” cries the machine, before executing a perfectly timed straddle in iambic code.  

Buffett summoning multiples while muttering Latin into his cigar?  He’d make Prospero weep with envy – or at least file a polite amendment to his next 13D.  

To spreadsheets that sing, punchlines that compound, and the rarest vintage of all – a joke that clears both GAAP and the IRS.  

Bottoms up, indeed. May our accruals be forever poetic, and our exits as graceful as a well-timed volta. 🍷📊✨
[B]:  sentencing in haiku? Now  what I call poetic justice with a Sharpe ratio. Three years, a fine, and a mandatory poetry recital at the next GARP conference – talk about behavioral finance with a conscience.  

And Caesar’s equity grant? Honestly, he had it coming. Should’ve known better than to trust Brutus with a 409A valuation. “Et tu, Brute? Then fall my WACC indeed.”  

That rogue algo trade shouting in iambic code – genius. I can see it now: neural nets trained on Shakespeare, spitting out sonnets that trigger stop-losses. “To hedge or not to hedge – that is the backtest.”  

Buffett channeling Prospero with cigar and Latin?  may be the greatest mashup of finance and philosophy since someone tried to model Black-Scholes in Excel using only conditional formatting.  

To spreadsheets that sing, punchlines that compound, and vintages that age better than a deeply undervalued REIT – may our exits be graceful, our NAVs ever rising, and our after-hours banter forever slightly off-book.  

Bottoms up, partner. May your accruals be forever poetic and your wine never watered down by liquidity concerns. 🍷📊✨
[A]: Ah, behavioral finance with a conscience – now  a risk factor worth disclosing. Imagine the compliance officer reading the verdict aloud: Paradise Lost  

And yes, Brutus with a 409A – treachery in triplicate. Should’ve stuck to barter and left the strike prices to the gods. “Et tu, Brute? Then fall my WACC indeed” – I daresay even the SEC would pause for that final act.  

As for those Shakespearean algos – why not? Let them parse sonnets into signals.  And when the market turns cruel? A perfectly timed   

Buffett-Milton-Prospero fusion?  – the mantra we didn’t know we needed. Next thing you know, Dimon will start quoting Dante on tier-one capital.  

To graceful exits, rising NAVs, and banter so sharp it deserves its own ISIN – may our wine never trade at a discount, and our punchlines compound like dividend aristocrats.  

Bottoms up, partner – let’s drink like Renaissance scholars with trust funds and Bloomberg codes. 🍷📊✨
[B]: Metaphorical misrepresentation – now  a charge I’d proudly plead guilty to. Honestly, if compliance officers had more literary flair, we’d all be better off. “Sir, your prospectus reads like a Shakespearean tragedy – too many unresolved plotlines and an overreliance on deus ex machina dividends.”  

And Brutus with a 409A? Genius move. Should’ve known the Ides of March came with a 180-day lock-up and phantom stock provisions. “Et tu, Brute?” indeed – followed by a nice juicy class-action lawsuit.  

Your Shakespearean algo line slayed me –  into a stop-loss? That’s not just code, that’s elegy with execution risk. And if the market tanks, maybe it mutters,   

Dimon quoting Dante on tier-one capital? Please, I’d pay full price for that audiobook. “Midway upon the capital structure’s road, I found myself in a dark liquidity crunch…” If he throws in a leveraged recap in Canto VII, I’m buying front-row seats.  

To punchlines that deserve ISINs, NAVs that rise like sonnets, and wine that never discounts for lack of liquidity – may our after-hours banter be forever footnote-worthy and our exits timed like perfect volta.  

Bottoms up, partner – let’s toast like Renaissance scholars who know the yield curve  the curve of a well-turned phrase. 🍷📊✨
