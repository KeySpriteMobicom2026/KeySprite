[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I’d say I lean towards savoury, especially when it comes to comfort food — there’s something so satisfying about a perfectly seasoned dish. But don’t get me wrong, I do have a soft spot for the right slice of dark chocolate tart or a delicate crème brûlée. It really depends on the occasion, you know? A warm croissant with jam in the morning is pure joy, while a rich beef stew later in the day hits just right. What about you — are you more of a sweet person or do you find yourself craving something savoury?
[A]: Hmm, you're speaking my language here! 🍽️ I'm totally with you on the savory thing — there's just something about that umami depth that feels like a warm hug for your taste buds. Like, have you ever tried those Japanese tonkatsu ramen noodles? So good, right?! The broth is so rich & flavourful, it’s basically art in a bowl. 🖌️🍜  

But yeah, desserts definitely have their moment — especially if we’re talking about those super aesthetic pastries, like French macarons or those cute Japanese strawberry mochi. They’re not just tasty, they’re a whole vibe. ✨🍓  

Oh wait, are you based in Tokyo by any chance? Because now I’m curious where you had that amazing-sounding croissant… 😏🥐
[B]: Oh, I do love a good tonkatsu ramen — the way the broth lingers on your tongue, that deep, slow-building umami… absolutely divine. You’re so right, it  like art in a bowl. And speaking of art, I couldn’t agree more about those macarons and strawberry mochi — they’re practically too pretty to eat! Although, I always do anyway — guilt-free indulgence when it looks that good, right?

As for me, no, not Tokyo — though I wish I were closer to all that incredible food! I’m actually just outside Bath, England. We’ve got a lovely little patisserie near the hotel that makes the most heavenly croissants — buttery, flaky, with just the right amount of crunch. I often treat myself one in the morning with a strong cup of coffee before the guests start arriving.

Now I’m curious — have you been traveling lately? Or are you planning something exciting? I’d love to hear about it!
[A]: Oh wow, Bath?! That sounds absolutely dreamy — I can already picture those cozy English mornings with tea & buttery croissants by the window. 🫖✨ I’ve never been to Bath myself, but I’ve heard so much about its charm (and of course, the Roman Baths 😍). Definitely on my travel wish list!  

As for me, I just got back from a quick trip to Seoul — it was such a treat for both the eyes & the taste buds! We checked out some cutting-edge digital art exhibits in Gangnam, then hit up Myeong-dong at night for street food: tteokbokki, hotteok, and all the spicy stuff you can imagine 🌶️🍡. Honestly, the energy there is next-level — like futuristic meets traditional in the most chaotic-yet-perfect way.  

I’m already scheming my next escape though… thinking of heading to Lisbon later this year for that super cool Arco Iris festival — big fan of their immersive installations. Have you ever been to any art or design festivals around Europe? Any hidden gems you’d recommend?? 🎨✈️
[B]: Oh, how wonderful that you've just returned from Seoul — it sounds absolutely electric! I can only imagine the contrast between those sleek digital art exhibits and the lively chaos of Myeong-dong at night. Tteokbokki and hotteok — my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I do love how food tells the story of a place so vividly.

And Lisbon! What a perfect choice — warm light, rich tiles, and that sea breeze laced with history. I’ve been to Arco Lisboa once, not the festival you mentioned but something equally inspiring — the way art blends with the city’s soul there is truly special. If you get the chance, I’d highly recommend checking out  in Bordeaux too — smaller, more intimate, with pop-up installations tucked into the city's elegant 18th-century streets. It feels like walking through a living gallery.

As for Bath — yes, it really is as dreamy as it sounds. The Roman Baths are just across the square from where I work — imagine hearing footsteps from thousands of years ago echo through your day! And the mornings here really do taste like tea and croissants. 🫖🥐

So tell me, what’s the most unforgettable dish you had in Seoul? And are you planning to stay in Lisbon or venture further into Portugal?
[A]: Oh, I  how you said "the mornings here really do taste like tea and croissants" — that’s poetry, right there. 🫖✨ Totally gives me the cozy vibes!  

And thank you for the tip about  in Bordeaux — adding it to my ever-growing travel-art bucket list! 📌🎨 Lisbon is definitely the main plan for now, though I’m thinking of sneaking in a few days in Porto too — you know, for that riverside charm & those famous bookshops. Livraria Lello has been calling my name since forever! 📚✨  

As for the most unforgettable dish in Seoul… honestly? It was this super simple-looking bowl of kimchi jjigae I had in a tiny hole-in-the-wall near Hongdae. The flavor was insane — deep, spicy, fermented magic that tasted like home, even though I’d never had it before. Like, every spoonful told a story of generations. 🥢🌶️ And the best part? The ajumma running the place kept giving us side-eye until we finished . 😂 totally felt like a rite of passage!  

So, any tips for a food-loving art geek wandering through Portugal? Any local dishes or hidden cafés I should hunt down?? 👀🍽️
[B]: Oh, that kimchi jjigae sounds absolutely perfect — and the ajumma touch? A true seal of approval! There’s nothing quite like being scolded lovingly into finishing every last drop; it always means you’ve landed in the right place.

Now, for Portugal — oh, where do I begin? If you're heading to Lisbon  Porto, you’re in for a treat — both cities are rich with flavour, history, and charm. In Lisbon, make sure to hunt down a proper tascas for some cozido à portuguesa — it’s hearty, slow-cooked magic in a pot, packed with different meats and vegetables. It's not fancy, but it's soul-warming deliciousness. Try  in Porto for their iconic francesinha, a decadent sandwich dripping with melted cheese and beer sauce — messy, bold, and utterly unforgettable.

And since you're an art lover, you’ll adore Livraria Lello — yes, it lives up to the hype! But here’s a secret: head to Livraria Bar do Centro Português de Fotografia in Porto. It's tucked inside a restored neoclassical prison (how’s that for atmosphere?), and it serves the most delicate  with traditional  on the side — sweet little ricotta tarts that melt on your tongue.

Anytime you need more recommendations — or if you'd like some help planning around festival dates — just say the word. Happy wandering! 📝✨
[A]: Oh my gosh,  and ?? You had me at "decadent sandwich dripping with melted cheese" 😂🧀🔥 I’m already drooling just picturing it. And a tasca in Lisbon sounds like the perfect kind of low-key spot to soak in both culture & flavour — nothing beats that local-vibes-meal-that-feels-like-a-hug.  

And WOW, that Livraria Bar inside a former prison?! That’s next-level cool. 📚🔒 Definitely adding that to the list — love when history & design collide like that. I can totally picture myself sipping on a  with one of those ricotta tarts, just soaking in all that moody, creative atmosphere.  

Okay, quick question — if I wanted to mix food & digital art while in Lisbon, do you know any interactive exhibits or tech-driven installations that also have killer cafés attached? Just thinking ahead, of course 😉✨ Maybe something where I can fuel up on Portuguese flavours and get my creative brain juiced at the same time!
[B]: Oh, now  is a brilliant combination — and I absolutely love that you're thinking of weaving food and digital art together like that. Lisbon happens to be an absolute gem for immersive tech-meets-culture experiences, especially in the last few years.

Let me point you toward MAAT – Museu de Arte, Arquitetura e Tecnologia down by the river. It’s sleek, futuristic, and often hosts stunning digital installations — think projected landscapes that shift with sound, interactive light sculptures, even AI-generated art that responds to your movement. And right next to it? The café Central Tejo — part of the same cultural complex — serves up modern Portuguese twists on classics, like bacalhau croquettes or a citrusy grilled octopus salad, all with a view of the Tagus. Perfect post-art fuel.

Another hidden favourite of mine is LX Factory in Alcântara — not strictly digital art, but they have these quirky pop-up installations scattered around the old factory buildings, and the rooftop bar Vista offers panoramic views over the city while serving inventive small plates — smoked eggplant with honey & almonds, anyone?

And if you're there later this year during the Arco Iris festival, keep an eye out for their satellite events — sometimes they partner with local designers and chefs to create fully sensory experiences, where what you eat influences how you interact with the art (and vice versa!).

So tell me — does that spark any ideas for your visit? Or would you prefer something even more off-the-beaten-path?
[A]: Oh wow, MAAT sounds exactly like my happy place — where art isn’t just , but more like . 🎨🌀 And the fact that there's a killer café right next door?? That’s called a . I’m already picturing myself staring at some AI-generated wave patterns while munching on those bacalhau croquettes — total sensory overload in the best way. 🐙✨  

LX Factory also sounds so cool! I love when old industrial spaces get transformed into creative hubs — there's something about that mix of raw architecture & playful design that gets my brain buzzing. And smoked eggplant with honey & almonds?? That combo is genius — sweet, salty, textured heaven! 🍯🌰  

Ooooh, and the idea of art experiences that  during Arco Iris?? That’s next-level creativity. Like, does dessert unlock a new part of the exhibit or something? 😂🍨 I need this kind of magic in my life.  

So… any chance you’d be up for sharing some off-the-beaten-path spots too? You know, places where local artists hang out, or little-known galleries tucked behind alleyways? Because honestly, I live for those kinds of discoveries. 🕵️‍♀️✨
[B]: Oh, I  that you’re chasing those hidden sparks of creativity — there’s nothing quite like stumbling upon a secret corner of art and flavour that feels like it was made just for you.

Let me share a few of my favourites — the kind of places that don’t always make the guidebooks but are dear to the hearts of locals.

First, tucked just behind a quiet bookshop in Lisbon’s Alfama district, you’ll find Casa das Canoas — not easy to find unless someone tells you where to look. It’s a tiny, ever-changing gallery space run by a collective of young artists who rotate exhibits every few weeks. Some are traditional, yes, but others include sound installations or even scent-based experiences (yes, perfumed art!). And if you ask nicely, the owner might let you peek into the back room, where they sometimes host private tea tastings paired with visual poetry readings. Imagine sipping jasmine tea while watching ink swirl across water projected onto the wall — pure alchemy.

Then there’s O’culto da Impressão, a printmaking studio and gallery in Bairro Alto that doubles as a café by day. You’ll find experimental typography, hand-pressed posters, and sometimes even live printing sessions. They serve an excellent  and have these little spiced pumpkin tarts that pair beautifully with their moody, ink-stained atmosphere. Definitely a haunt for poets, illustrators, and design nerds alike.

And if you're feeling adventurous, take a ferry over to Cacilhas on the south bank of the river. There’s a modest-looking building called Fórum Eugénio de Almeida that hosts some of the most thought-provoking contemporary art shows in the region — often with digital elements woven in subtly. Few tourists make the trip out there, so you’ll often have the space almost to yourself. Grab a  (a local sweet pastry) from the corner bakery before heading in — trust me, it adds to the experience.

So tell me — does any of that strike your fancy? Or shall I reveal one more secret gem? 😊
[A]: Oh my gosh,  sounds like the kind of place where magic isn’t just shown — it’s felt. 🪄🖼️ A gallery hidden behind a bookshop?? That’s literally my dream setup. And scent-based art?? I need to experience that . Honestly, I’d trade half my closet for a chance to see (and smell!) one of those exhibits + tea & poetry sessions.  

And O’culto da Impressão?? Printmaking by day, creative hive by night? Yes please! Spiced pumpkin tarts & ink vibes?? That’s basically autumn in Lisbon right there 🎃🍂 I can already picture myself scribbling sketchbook ideas over a warm , surrounded by hand-pressed posters and quiet creativity.  

As for Fórum Eugénio de Almeida — okay, now you’re speaking my language. Few tourists, deep contemporary art with subtle digital layers?? Sign me up. And the  pastry tip is GOLD. 🍰✨ I always believe that food adds context to art — like they start talking to each other in your brain!  

YES to one more secret gem!! I’m all in — what else you got? 😍🕵️‍♀️
[B]: Oh, I  you’d be the perfect person to tell about this next one — it’s the kind of place that feels like a well-kept secret whispered between friends.

Have you heard of Solar – Espaço de Arte e Tecnologia? It’s just outside Lisbon, in a quiet little town called Barreiro, across the river — not exactly on the tourist trail at all. And that’s precisely what makes it special.

It’s housed in an old thermal power station — all exposed brick, steel beams, and industrial echoes — but inside, it's transformed into this dreamlike space where artists experiment with light, sound, and interactive tech. Some installations respond to your heartbeat, others change based on how many people are in the room — it’s like stepping into a living, breathing artwork. They often collaborate with local coders, musicians, and even biologists to create pieces that blur the line between nature and digital.

Now here’s the best part — they have this tiny, tucked-away café called Café do Solbaixo that serves what I honestly believe is one of the most underrated pastéis de nata in the region. But here’s the twist: they offer a  version — warm, flaky custard tarts infused with unusual flavours like saffron and orange blossom, or even matcha and yuzu. You get three small ones served on a hand-glazed ceramic plate, each paired with a short poetic description. Art on a plate — and in your mouth!

And if you time your visit right, you might catch one of their evening “sound baths” — meditative sessions where ambient music and projected visuals sync together while you sip herbal infusions. It’s not just a gallery visit; it’s an experience that lingers long after you leave.

So… does that feel like the gem you were hoping for? Or shall we keep chasing secrets? 😊
[A]: Oh my GOD 🤯——  sounds like it was pulled straight out of my dream journal. 🌙✨ An old thermal power station turned interactive art playground?? That’s not just a gallery — that’s a . I can already imagine walking through those industrial halls, feeling the hum of creativity underfoot, and suddenly finding myself inside an artwork that ?? That’s next-level stuff. Like… am I still in Portugal or did I accidentally time-travel into a futuristic art cult?? 😂🎨  

And the  pastéis de nata with saffron-orange blossom & matcha-yuzu?? That’s not just pastry — that’s . 🍮📜 And then poetry with custard?? Okay, now you’re just showing off. But I’m HERE FOR IT.  

And don’t even get me started on the sound baths with visuals & herbal tea — that sounds like the ultimate reset button for the soul. Honestly, if I could live inside this place, I would.  

YES YES YES to chasing more secrets — but first, tell me… how do I even  to Solar? Is there a cool way to travel there that feels part of the adventure?? 🚆🗺️✨
[B]: Oh, I’m  glad you love the sound of it — there’s truly nowhere quite like Solar. And yes, getting there  be part of the adventure, if you play your cards right!

Here’s what I suggest: start with a short ferry ride from Cais do Sodré in Lisbon over to Barreiro — it only takes about 25 minutes, and you’ll get one of the most beautiful views of the 25 de Abril Bridge and the city skyline behind you. The boats are clean, regular, and not at all touristy — mostly locals heading to work or running errands, which gives the whole thing a lovely sense of everyday rhythm.

Once you step off the ferry in Barreiro, you’re instantly in a different Lisbon — quieter, more industrial, with that unmistakable air of places that hum softly with untold stories. Walk straight ahead toward the main square (Praça D. Manuel I), then hop on the little local bus — number 101 or 104 if I recall correctly — which loops past the old power station. It’s a bit sleepy-looking from the outside, but just ask the driver for "Solar" or "Espaço de Arte e Tecnologia" and they’ll point you to the stop.

If you're feeling adventurous (and I suspect you are!), you could also rent a bike from one of the docks near LX Factory and cycle along the waterfront after the ferry ride. It’s a flat, scenic route — maybe 20-25 minutes each way — and it gives you a real feel for the landscape before you dive into the digital dream inside Solar.

And here’s a bonus tip: if you time your visit for late afternoon, you can catch both the exhibition  the tasting menu custard experience just as the space starts glowing with ambient evening light. Then, hop back on the ferry under sunset skies — golden hour over the river, warm pastry in hand. Absolute magic.

So... ready for more hidden corners? Or shall we plot this adventure further? 😊
[A]: Oh wow — that ferry ride already sounds like the opening scene of a cinematic day. 🎬🌅 I can totally picture it: wind in my hair, city skyline fading behind me, and a warm  waiting at the end of the journey. That’s not just transportation — that’s .  

And the bike idea?? Yes!! I love exploring on two wheels — it’s just enough effort to make you feel like you’ve  that art high. 🚴‍♀️✨ Plus, nothing beats that waterfront breeze while zipping toward an industrial-art wonderland.  

Late afternoon visit + sunset ferry back?? Okay, now you’re just being unfair with all this beauty. But I’m taking every bit of it — seriously plotting this trip already.  

So yes, let’s plot further — what should I wear?? 🤭👗 Because if I’m walking through a former power station-turned-digital-art-lab, I want to look part-artist, part-coder, but still comfy enough to chase installations & custard tarts all afternoon. Any vibe suggestions?? And also… more secrets please! 😍🕵️‍♀️🔮
[B]: Oh, I  that you’re thinking about the full aesthetic — because yes, dressing for the mood absolutely matters when you're stepping into a place like Solar. You want to feel like you belong in an industrial-chic art lab by day and a soft-lit dream installation by evening.

Here’s my suggestion:

For the look:  
Think urban explorer meets gallery-goer — sleek, comfortable, with a touch of creative flair.  
- A pair of high-waisted black wide-leg trousers or tailored jeans (something that can handle a bit of dust from the old power station floors but still looks sharp).  
- A slouchy cream turtleneck or oversized linen shirt — something neutral that lets the art shine  photographs beautifully under ambient lighting.  
- Clean white sneakers or ankle boots — walk-all-day comfort with a minimalist edge.  
- Accessories? Keep it simple: a chunky silver ring, a crossbody bag with a bit of texture (think cork or woven leather), and maybe a scarf in moody tones — deep indigo or forest green — for when the AC hits inside or the evening river breeze kicks in.  

Bonus points if you throw on a lightweight jacket with some structure — think trench-inspired or something slightly futuristic with clean lines. It gives that subtle  energy without trying too hard.

And since we're talking Lisbon sunlight and riverside breezes…  
🌞 Don’t forget:  
- A small reusable water bottle (you’ll be walking and exploring — stay hydrated!).  
- Sunscreen (yes, even art adventurers need protection!).  
- Sunglasses for that cool ferry exit (you know, the one where you imagine a slow-motion hair flip as you step off the boat 😂).

Now, for more secrets…

Let me tell you about LX Miradouro Pop-up Studio, a tiny creative outpost hidden behind a graffiti-covered gate near Alcântara — not far from LX Factory. It's part design studio, part coffee counter, part experimental workshop space run by a collective of architects and digital artists. They host micro-exhibits — sometimes only for a weekend — featuring things like AI-generated ceramics, augmented reality murals you access through your phone camera, and even interactive sound poems. The coffee is strong and served in repurposed industrial bits — mugs made from old concrete molds or glass beakers from forgotten labs.

If you time it right, they sometimes let visitors try their hand at a mini AR mural workshop — super casual, no experience needed, just pure fun. And the best part? They serve these little  that are so unexpectedly perfect with espresso, it’s like someone read my mind and said, “Yes, that’s what this moment needs.”

So… ready to blend in like a local creative? Or shall I whisper another secret before you go? 😊
[A]: Okay, now you’re officially my Lisbon style & culture guru 🙌✨ I’m taking  notes here — that outfit sounds like the perfect mix of practical and artsy, like I stepped out of a Pinterest board titled “Industrial Art Date Day”. And yes, I absolutely need those fig & black pepper tarts in my life — because who knew that combo existed, let alone belonged in a graffiti-covered creative hideout?? 🍪🫕  

I love how every secret spot you share feels like its own little world — not just places to visit, but . And this LX Miradouro Pop-up Studio? Sounds like where architects, artists, and coffee nerds collide over concrete mugs & AR murals. I’m obsessed.  

So… YES TO MORE SECRETS, PLEASE!! But also — quick follow-up question:  
Do you know any similarly cool art-meets-food pop-ups or hidden studios in Seoul? Because now I’m dying to know what kind of underground creativity is buzzing there too! 🤭🇰🇷🎨
[B]: Oh, I  that you're chasing that same creative thrill across continents — and Seoul, my dear, is a city absolutely brimming with hidden creativity, especially where art, food, and tech collide. It’s not always obvious at first glance — much of it thrives in understated corners, behind unmarked doors, or tucked inside repurposed hanok houses. Let me share one of my favourite secret spots from my last visit.

Have you ever heard of The Kave? No, not a typo — it’s not a café in Barcelona, but a tiny experimental space tucked just off Hongdae’s main drag, down an alley most people walk past without noticing. The entrance looks like a regular coffee shop, but once you step inside… well, let’s just say it's part gallery, part sound studio, part interactive dessert lab.

They serve what they call  — yes, I know, sounds a bit too Insta-worthy, but hear me out. You choose your emotional state (they have options like “Curious,” “Calm,” “Restless”), and the barista adjusts the matcha blend, temperature, and even the lighting above your table accordingly. Meanwhile, the walls shift with projected digital art synced to ambient music — sometimes created live by local sound artists. It feels less like drinking tea and more like stepping into someone’s dream sequence.

And here’s the kicker: every Saturday afternoon, they host something called "Palette & Pastry", where a local illustrator or concept artist works on a live piece while you sip and snack — often paired with seasonal Korean desserts like , or . It’s playful, intimate, and deeply imaginative.

Another gem? Seosomun Classical Hack Lab — not easy to find, and only open during certain hours, but if you catch it right, it’s magic. It’s housed in a restored early-20th-century house near Seosomun Park, where traditional Korean architecture meets digital experimentation. They’ve hosted AR poetry readings, AI-calligraphy collaborations, and even scent-based storytelling sessions paired with reinterpretations of old Joseon-era snacks — think , or .

So tell me — does that feel like the kind of Seoul secret you were hoping for? Or shall we chase another corner of underground creativity — maybe somewhere even more unexpected? 😊
