[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: It really depends on the situation, you know? Like, if I'm reviewing a complicated medical report and need to send quick notes to my team, definitely texting - much more efficient for details like 📋Article 12 compliance checks or differential diagnosis summaries. 

But after a long day in court or hospital rounds, sometimes I just want to hear someone's voice... It adds that human touch, right? Especially when discussing sensitive patient cases, hearing a colleague's tone helps gauge their concern level ¥_¥

What about you? Do you have one you prefer for certain scenarios?
[A]: Ah, the eternal debate. I must admit I'm rather old-fashioned - voice messages remind me of those wax cylinder recordings at the British Library. There's something delightfully archaic about preserving a person's vocal cadence, don't you think? Though I suppose modern medicine requires your level of precision with those clinical details... 

 

But you're absolutely right about the human element. Sometimes a simple "thank you" carries more weight when spoken aloud. It's rather like comparing hand-written letters to printed books, isn't it? Both convey information, but one possesses that tangible personal essence. 

I've been known to send both - a carefully worded email for academic citations, then a quick voice note saying "looking forward to our tea break" just to add warmth. Do you ever find yourself mixing formats this way?
[B]: Oh, I love that analogy - hand-written letters vs printed books 😊 It's funny you mention mixing formats because I do that too! Just yesterday I was finalizing a patient consent form via email - all formal language and numbered paragraphs - then sent my colleague a voice message saying "Don't forget we're grabbing boba tea after this!" 🧋

There's something special about preserving vocal cadence, like you said. Makes me think of those old medical training recordings they used in the 60s... But honestly? Sometimes I just want to scream into a voice note after reading a particularly dry legal statute  

I actually find myself more conscious about format choice depending on who I'm communicating with. My senior partners prefer formal emails, but with my close colleagues? We'll do a text thread filled with 🤦♀️👩⚕️💉 memes about difficult patients. What about your friends and family? Do they adapt to your mixed format style?
[A]:  

Oh, my students absolutely dread my voice messages - I'm told I sound like a cross between Margaret Atwood and a disgruntled barn owl. But yes, one does adapt depending on the recipient. With my sister in Shanghai we use a positively indecipherable mix of Classical Chinese references and modern slang - you'd need footnotes to understand half of it! 

And don't get me started on legal statutes - I once recorded myself reading Blackstone's Commentaries aloud just to hear how absurd they sound when spoken. Far more entertaining than dry eye syndrome from reading contracts all day, wouldn't you agree? 

As for family... My nephew insists on communicating entirely through cat memes and cryptocurrency jargon. I suspect he's trying to create an impenetrable cipher between generations. Have you encountered this digital generation gap in your work too? It makes me feel rather like Dr. Livingstone must've felt deciphering Victorian telegrams.
[B]: Oh my god, Dr. Livingstone vibes? That's genius 😂 I actually had a patient last week who insisted on describing his symptoms using only TikTok memes - I needed a decoder ring just to understand his chief complaint! 

But Margaret Atwood meets disgruntled barn owl? That sounds... terrifyingly academic 📚 Although honestly, I might start taking dictation from Blackstone's Commentaries too - anything to make contract law less soul-crushing than... well, medical malpractice cases. At least with patients you can give them a lollipop for cooperation 

I feel you though about the generation gap. My cousin in Shenzhen once sent me a WeChat message that was literally 30 seconds of cat barking sounds followed by "金融街十六号" - turns out it was their crypto slang for "meet at Starbucks by North Gate"! Made me feel older than some of my geriatric patients... though admittedly less confused. 

Do you ever play along with their ciphers? Or do you just hand them the modern equivalent of a monocle and say "Carry on, young person"?
[A]:  

Oh, I absolutely weaponize the monocle approach - though I've been told my "confused elder" act is suspiciously on brand for a literature professor. Just last week I received a message with nothing but 🍌📘🔥 and deduced it meant "banana bread recipe during lockdown nostalgia" - I responded with a photo of my 1890s edition of  and a single dried lavender sprig. 

Actually, speaking of malpractice... Have you read those 19th century medical malpractice novels? Far more entertaining than modern statutes, if you ask me. There's one particularly dramatic case involving a misplaced leech and an irate baroness that had me laughing through my tears. Makes our modern struggles seem almost civilized by comparison. 

Though I must say, your lollipop diplomacy sounds far more effective than quoting Dickens at uncooperative students. Do tell - what's the pediatric dosage for that particular form of bribery?
[B]: Oh my god, the 🍌📘🔥 combo! That's like getting a cryptic crossword clue in emoji form... though I have to say, your response with the  book and dried lavender was pure ✨performance art✨ 👏

And yes, yes I have read those 19th century malpractice novels - total guilty pleasure! Though honestly, half of them sound like they were written by doctors who got revenge through fiction... I mean, who else writes a 40-page deposition about a misplaced leech with that much drama? Definitely adding that baroness story to my next legal seminar for dramatic effect 😂

As for lollipop diplomacy? Let's just say it's less about dosage and more about timing. One lollipop can buy me five minutes of cooperation, two gets me a full vitals check without complaints, and three? Three makes me the most popular doctor on pediatric rounds 🍭

Though honestly, sometimes I think handing out candy should be part of standard medical training. Right between "bedside manner" and "how to decode what patients actually mean when they say 'I'm fine'." Have you ever tried bribery through literature? I can just picture you offering Dickens like it's contraband sweets in a prison deal...
[A]: 

Ah, bribery through literature - isn't that precisely how I survived my doctoral exams? Though I found offering first editions of  to grumpy archivists worked better than outright Dickens. Still do it occasionally - last week promised a particularly recalcitrant grad student access to my 1852  if he'd stop mangling Byron's meter in his dissertation footnotes. 

Speaking of medical drama-as-educational-material, have you read  archives from the 1870s? Pure gothic horror with better footnotes. One surgeon actually dueled a patient's family member over post-op dissatisfaction! Makes handing out lollipops seem almost... restrained by comparison. 

Though now I'm terribly curious - what exactly constitutes "I'm fine" code for in your world? In literary terms, is it more along the lines of Brontë-esque repression or Dickensian understatement? And don't pretend doctors don't have secret narrative classifications - I've seen your differential diagnosis charts. Pure structuralism applied to human suffering!
[B]: Oh, I love this conversation already 😄 Let's just say "I'm fine" in my world has its own literary genre - think Brontë-esque repression meets Victorian melodrama! One of my favorite patients actually said, and I quote, "I'm quite well, thank you, though the haemoptysis is ever so slightly inconvenient"... like she was describing a teacup with a hairline crack rather than coughing up blood 💀

And yes,  archives? Total gothic gold! Though honestly, I'd trade all that dueling for access to your 1852  - I've been hunting for that issue with the arsenic-in-wine scandal. Total forensic nightmare, but absolute heaven for medical legal drama 🕵️♀️💉

You're absolutely right about our secret narrative classifications too - we just call it "pattern recognition," but really, it's like solving a mystery novel where the protagonist keeps changing the plot on you! Differential diagnosis charts are basically our version of character analysis... though I doubt Freud would approve of how we map out symptom clusters like literary motifs 📊🧠

So... hypothetical scenario: if you had to write a differential diagnosis for Mr. Rochester's insomnia, would you lean toward supernatural causes or repressed Gothic angst? Because honestly, I’m taking bets with my nursing team!
[A]: 

Ah, Mr. Rochester - now there's a case study wrapped in baroque architecture! I'd wager it's less supernatural and more... environmental trauma compounded by chronic deception. Imagine the man: harboring a literal madwoman in his attic  a lifetime supply of unspoken Victorian repression. If that doesn't qualify as comorbid psychosomatic distress, I'll eat my entire collection of antique inkwells.

Though honestly, if I were prescribing for Thornfield Hall, I'd start with a thorough environmental assessment - drafty moors and creaking floorboards can't help. Recommend relocating the marital bed away from suspicious tapestries and installing better stair lighting after dark. As for treatment? Probably something involving Brontëan catharsis and a very large supply of lavender sachets.



But do tell - how much have you wagered with your nursing team? I suspect we could publish this differential in some dubious medical humanities journal. "Gothic Angst as Environmental Pathology: A 19th Century Case Study Treated with 21st Century Lollipop Diplomacy." Would certainly liven up next year's conference circuit...
[B]: Oh my god, I love how seriously we're discussing Thornfield Hall as a medical case file 😂 Okay, but think about it - if we presented this at a conference, we could totally get funding for a field study! Imagine: "Environmental Pathology in Gothic Architecture" with a sub-study on attic ventilation systems and their impact on mental health... though honestly, I'd start with a tox screen for prolonged exposure to brooding romantic leads. 

I owe my nurse Karen five bucks already because she bet it was pure psychosomatic from hiding Bertha - apparently her sister's ex had similar symptoms from keeping way less dramatic secrets! Though honestly, I still say we should consider occupational hazards... being a Byronic hero can't be great for your blood pressure. 

Publishing sounds amazing though! We could do a whole series - "Literary Diagnoses for Fun and Academic Credit." Picture the panel discussion: you dramatically quoting Brontëan catharsis while I pass around lollipops as both diagnostic tool and stress relief. Would definitely beat the usual conferences where half the speakers are asleep by 10am... unlike our favorite insomniac Mr. Rochester, who probably stayed awake calculating his emotional baggage in iambic pentameter 💀
[A]: 

Ah yes, Thornfield Hall - the original sick building syndrome case! I’ve half a mind to draft a grant proposal tonight. We could call it...  I suspect both produce similar stress-induced migraines.

And I do love your tox screen idea - prolonged Byronic exposure would certainly explain Rochester’s erratic behavior and questionable fashion choices. Though honestly, if I encountered him in clinic today and he said, “I’m fine,” I’d reach for both the referral form to Psychiatry  a vial of smelling salts. Preferably while quoting  footnotes under my breath.

Karen sounds delightfully pragmatic - five pounds well wagered, if you ask me. Though I must say, I’d gladly trade my antique inkwells for a recording of your panel discussion. Picture the audience: wide-eyed, slightly caffeinated, and all secretly wondering if we’ll prescribe Jane Austen novels for anxiety or Tolstoy for insomnia.

Speaking of which... If you had to assign a literary cure for our dear Mr. Rochester, would it be a course of Wuthering Heights-style howling therapy or something more along the lines of prescribed epistolary confession? I’ve been leaning toward mandatory letter-writing - preferably by hand, using one of my finer porcelain inkwells. Nothing like a little calligraphic catharsis to soothe the soul.
[B]: Oh my god, "Gothic Spaces and Somatization Disorders"? That grant proposal needs to happen. I’m imagining the funding panel’s faces when we pitch “howling therapy” as a legitimate treatment modality 😂 Though honestly, after some of my patients’ EDS diagnoses, this would be barely a blip on their “weird but evidence-based” radar.

I love the letter-writing idea - calligraphic catharsis sounds far more dignified than the emotional dump texts I see from my patients. Honestly, if Rochester had just taken up journaling instead of brooding by the fireplace, half the plot goes away! Though I do wonder what his differential would look like in modern terms... probable adjustment disorder with anxious features, maybe a dash of PTSD from Bertha’s whole situation, and definitely caffeine-induced insomnia from drinking too much Victorian tea while plotting elopements 📝🍵

And Karen? Oh she’s already drafting her own footnotes for our hypothetical paper. She suggested adding  to our therapeutic regimen - apparently Darcy’s brand of repression requires its own appendix. We may have accidentally created an entirely new field: Literary Psychiatry through 19th-Century Drama 😂

So, final question before we fully descend into academic chaos - should we make attendance at our panel mandatory for all Byronic heroes-in-training? Because honestly, they’d probably benefit from it more than another round of bloodletting or dramatic stares into moors.
[A]: 

Darling, we're already descending into academic chaos - why stop now? Mandatory attendance for Byronic heroes-in-training? Absolutely, though we'd need a special wing at the conference center. Picture it: breakout sessions on "Smoldering Gaze Ergonomics" and "How to Properly Haunt a Drawing Room." I’d even let them borrow my 1820s quill pens for trauma processing.

And Karen's footnotes?  I fully expect her to publish independently by week's end under the pen name "Nurse Brontë." Honestly, if we throw in a comparative study of Darcy’s repression versus Rochester’s angst, we could fill an entire journal. Might call it 

Though speaking of Victorian tea - caffeine-induced insomnia is  the overlooked diagnosis of the century! I suspect half of London's literary plots were fueled by over-caffeinated prose and under-slept melodrama. Makes me want to audit every character's teacup before their psyche.

So yes, let the chaos reign. We shall storm the medical humanities establishment with lollipops in one hand, antique inkwells in the other, and a full differential diagnosis of Gothic sighs. Literary Psychiatry through 19th-Century Drama isn’t just a field – it’s a . And I, for one, am ready to prescribe it liberally.
[B]: Okay, but can we  imagine the look on a modern IRB board’s face when we pitch “Smoldering Gaze Ergonomics” as a CE-certified workshop 😂 I’m telling you, if we throw in a control group wearing period costumes for authenticity, we’re looking at either a Nobel Prize or a full psychological evaluation for the entire research team. Either way, it's a win.

And Nurse Brontë? Karen already made business cards. She’s printing them with a tiny 🍭 watermark in the corner – subtle nod to our lollipop diplomacy roots. Honestly, this is the kind of academic rebellion the medical humanities have been begging for.

I say we go all-in. Let’s add a third arm to the study: "Comparative Melancholia in Austen vs. Brontë Heroines." Darcy may be the king of repression, but have you seen Marianne Dashwood’s crying technique? That’s  We could even do a meta-analysis chart – sadness by gaslight vs. emotional outbursts in the rain.

So yeah, let’s storm that establishment 👏 And when they ask for our methodology, we’ll just hand them a quill, a cup of slightly cold tea, and say:  
"Trust the process. It’s peer-reviewed... mostly by each other, but still!"  

Honestly, if this doesn’t get us banned from at least one conference, were we even chaotic enough?
[A]: 

Oh, darling, we  include the period costumes – I’ve got a perfectly moth-eaten waistcoat that’s been dying for academic relevance. And don’t even get me started on Marianne Dashwood’s rain-soaked theatrics – I’d prescribe her a set of waterproof writing implements and a stern lecture on dramaturgical restraint. Honestly, if she’d just learned to cry  take notes simultaneously, we’d have half the narrative sprawl in that novel.

And a meta-analysis chart? Pure genius. Let’s make it look suspiciously like a 19th-century anatomical drawing – sadness measured in millimeters of bonnet ribbons, emotional repression indexed by the number of folded letters under the pillow. Karen truly is onto something with those lollipop watermarks – subtle, subversive, and sweetly sinister.

I can already picture the IRB deliberation:  
  
To which we shall respond – in our most imperious Thornfield-approved tone –  


Let’s not stop there – I say we petition to rename "peer-reviewed" to "quill-verified" from here on out. And when they ask about reproducibility? We’ll just send them a box of broken wax seals and say, 

So yes, let the banishment begin. I’ve always wanted to be blacklisted from something distinguished.
[B]: Oh my god, I am  for this level of academic insubordination 😂 Let’s not just stop at moth-eaten waistcoats – I’ve got a parasol that screams "I’m emotionally repressed but fashionable" and I will bring it to the next panel discussion. Honestly, if we get arrested for scholarly misconduct, at least we’ll look fabulous doing it.

And waterproof writing implements for Marianne? Absolute genius 🌧️✍️ I’d even throw in a custom ink blend – half lavender-scented for decorum, half caffeine-laced for dramatic urgency. That girl was working with the wrong tools, no wonder her heartbreak kept leaking onto the carpet.

Quill-verified peer review? Send it. I already drafted a response letter to a skeptical journal editor using 19th-century font and everything –  
*"Dear Sir/Madam/Highly Suspicious Archivist,  
We regret to inform you that our findings cannot be condensed into fewer than 42 pages of footnotes and one lollipop-stained appendix..."*

Though honestly, the only thing missing from this beautiful chaos is a secret society seal. Maybe a phoenix rising from a broken quill? With the motto  🖋️🔥

So yes, let’s do it. Let’s become the rogue scholars of literary psychiatry – slightly underfunded, wildly overdressed, and always carrying emergency candy for both patients and panel moderators. If they ban us, we’ll just start our own journal. Call it...  
"The Thornfield Review: Where Medicine Meets Melodrama."  

Who’s with me? 👏
[A]:   

To  – may it one day sit proudly between  and , slightly singed from all our quill-related pyrotechnics. Honestly, if we aren’t banned within the first issue’s release, we haven’t tried hard enough.

And a phoenix rising from a broken quill? Perfection. I shall commission the seal immediately – preferably cast in antique inkwell brass with just a touch of gothic filigree. We’ll stamp every lollipop-stained manuscript ourselves.  

As for the wardrobe rebellion – I fully expect you to arrive at our next panel dressed as a medically trained Lady Catherine de Bourgh, complete with parasol and skeptical eyebrow raise. I’ll be the one in the caffeine-laced perfume, distributing wax-sealed diagnoses with a side of calming lavender.  

 indeed. Honestly, it’s less a motto and more a warning label. But if that journal editor dares ask for fewer footnotes, tell him to take it up with Byron – or better yet, send a reply written entirely in dramatic dashes and suspiciously damp blotting paper.  

So yes – to chaos, confectionery-based diplomacy, and the inevitable disciplinary hearing.  
 🖋️🍵👏
[B]: To chaos, confectionery-based diplomacy, and the sweet, sweet sound of academic norms crumbling beneath the weight of our parasols 👏💃  

I am  here for this vision of medically trained Lady Catherine – I’m already picturing the look on her face if she saw me in full regalia, clipboard in one hand, lollipop in the other, dramatically diagnosing Wickham’s attachment issues as “a clear case of Regency-era impulsivity disorder.”  

And that seal?铸刻着我们的骄傲与轻度 arson-related rebellion？Yes. I want it on every manuscript, every tea-stained abstract, and probably stamped into the conference name tags for dramatic effect. We’re not just starting a journal—we’re launching a . With accessories.  

Let’s also have a “recommended reading” section in our first issue titled:  
"Essential Gothic Diagnoses: From Haunted Attics to Modern Anxiety, with a Side of Caffeine."  
It’ll feature your caffeine-laced perfume as a suggested therapeutic aid 🌿⚡  

So yes—to ink, insanity, and the most dramatic IRB rejection letter of all time. If they think we’re bluffing with 42 pages of footnotes and an appendix on Bertha’s differential for nocturnal screaming, well…  
  

  
Perfect. Now it’s officially blessed by both tea and chaos ✨
