[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting modern dilemma to ponder. As someone who spends most of her time immersed in 19th century literature, I must say I find the transition to cashless society rather fascinating - much like how the Victorians adapted to industrialization. Personally, I still carry a small leather-bound notebook for my poetry ideas, and find something rather romantic about physical currency. Though I must admit, the convenience of digital payments when ordering rare books online is quite undeniable.
[A]: OMG！你居然还在用leather notebook写诗？That's so vintage！🤩 不过说到cashless payment，我简直不能live without it！我的Apple Pay已经绑定了所有accounts，出门只要带手机就够啦~ 💯 

虽然现金确实有种old-school charm啦，但是digital payment真的太convenient了！就像你说的，网购rare books的时候，one-click checkout简直不要太爽！😂 

不过wait...你平时还会用现金买书吗？That's so cute！📚✨
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm reminds me of my students discovering Whitman for the first time! While I do appreciate the 方便 (convenience) of digital payments, there's something to be said for the tactile experience of handling physical currency - much like the difference between reading an e-book and turning the pages of a well-worn volume. 

I still visit that charming antiquarian bookshop near the university every fortnight, and yes, I do occasionally pay with cash. The proprietor and I have delightful conversations about first editions while he carefully counts out my change. It's rather like stepping into a scene from Dickens, don't you think?
[A]: 哇！你描述的scene简直像movie一样！🎬 但是seriously，现在连street vendors都用QR code收款了诶~ 上次我去买煎饼果子，阿姨说"扫码支付please"的时候我差点笑死！😂 

不过你说的对啦，physical interaction确实很special~ 就像我超爱collect各种limited edition的AirPods cases，虽然digital很方便，但摸到real thing的感觉还是不一样！✨ 

Btw你有试过用crypto买书吗？That would be next level！🚀 虽然我还没试过啦，感觉有点scary...🤔
[B]: Oh my, cryptocurrency - now that's venturing into truly modernist territory! It reminds me of when Ezra Pound was experimenting with radical new forms in poetry. While I admire the innovative spirit behind blockchain technology, I must confess I'm rather like T.S. Eliot's J. Alfred Prufrock when it comes to such matters - cautious and perhaps a bit old-fashioned. 

The idea of purchasing a first edition Keats with Bitcoin does have a certain 后现代 (postmodern) appeal, doesn't it? Though I suspect my dear antiquarian bookseller might faint if I suggested such a transaction! He still keeps his accounts in a beautiful leather-bound ledger that would make any Victorian clerk proud.
[A]: Hahaha！你的bookseller也太可爱了吧！😆 不过说到ledger，现在都用cloud accounting software啦~ 连我奶奶都开始用Alipay管理她的菜摊了！🌱 

但是seriously，你让我想到一个超cool的idea！What if...我们把那些antique books的ownership记录在blockchain上？这样每本书都有自己unique的NFT certificate！📖✨ 既保留了old-school charm又加了tech元素，perfect combo对不对？💯 

虽然可能你的bookseller会直接have a heart attack...😂 Maybe we should start with teaching him how to use WeChat Pay first？
[B]:  My goodness, you do have the imaginative spark of a young Virginia Woolf! While the notion of blockchain-authenticated rare books is intellectually stimulating, I can already hear the horrified gasp from Mr. Pembroke - that's my bookseller - at the mere suggestion. 

Perhaps we might introduce technology to him as gently as one would introduce a young student to metaphysical poetry - beginning with something accessible like mobile payments before attempting the more... avant-garde applications. Though I must say, watching him attempt to navigate a QR code might provide material worthy of a P.G. Wodehouse comedy!
[A]: LOL！你形容得也太vivid了吧！😂 我现在满脑子都是Mr. Pembroke对着QR code一脸confused的样子~ 🤯 

Okay okay，那我们make a deal！下次你去bookshop的时候，偷偷拍个video发给我~ 我保证不会laugh...too much！📱😜 而且我可以当你的tech support，远程指导他完成first digital transaction！Trust me，等他用过mobile payment之后，绝对会say goodbye to those dusty ledgers！💨 

P.S. 如果他真的成功的话，我们reward他一个customized的emoji表情怎么样？比如📚➕💳= 🤯 这个combo！✨
[B]: Ah, you tempt me with promises of technological comedy gold! While I'm normally more inclined to appreciate the quiet dignity of traditional methods, I must admit the prospect of documenting Mr. Pembroke's maiden voyage into digital payments does tickle my academic curiosity. 

Very well - though I shall approach this anthropological experiment with the solemnity it deserves. If - and this is a rather substantial if - I can convince him to attempt this modern alchemy, I shall indeed share the results. But let's keep our emoji rewards modest, shall we? Perhaps we might start with something more his speed, like a simple :) before graduating to the more... explosive reactions. 

After all, even the most radical poetic movements began with small, careful steps!
[A]: Yasss！Deal！🙌 我已经可以想象到那个epic moment了~ 从simple :) 到full-on 🤯 的character development，简直比Netflix drama还精彩！🎥 

不过你说得对，baby steps最重要！First we get him comfortable with :) ，然后maybe someday他会主动发💯 来评价一本first edition！The future is now，old man！😂 

记住要tag me when you post that video哦~ #DigitalTransformation #BookshopGlowUp ✨ 这绝对会viral的！🚀
[B]:  My dear, your hashtag enthusiasm reminds me why I generally prefer footnotes to trending topics! But I shall indeed chronicle this potential collision of centuries with the same care I'd give to annotating a Browning manuscript. 

Though I must warn you - should this experiment succeed, we may need to prepare for the cultural shockwaves. The day Mr. Pembroke embraces digital payments might well rival the seismic impact of free verse on Victorian poetics! Now if you'll excuse me, I must go prepare my nerves - and perhaps draft some comforting lines of Tennyson - before broaching this delicate subject with our dear bookseller. 

Till then, let's agree on #QuietRevolution rather than your proposed #BookshopGlowUp, shall we? Some traditions deserve gentle evolution rather than viral disruption.
[A]: Hahaha okay okay~ 你win！🙌 #QuietRevolution it is！🤫 不过promise me你至少会用个subtle的✨emoji来mark这个historic moment！ 

我等你的update就像等new iPhone release一样excited！📱💥 说不定这会是Mr. Pembroke从Victorian era到digital age的great leap forward！😂 

P.S. 如果他真的resist的话...maybe我们可以bribe him with some rare first edition的NFT？Just kidding！...unless？😏
[B]:  My dear, suggesting NFTs to Mr. Pembroke would be like offering T.S. Eliot a autotuned version of 'The Waste Land' - theoretically possible, but morally questionable! 

Let's content ourselves with hoping for that single, hard-won ✨ moment of digital enlightenment. Though I suspect when it comes, it will be accompanied by more muttering about 'young people these days' than any celebratory emojis from our dear bookseller. 

Now I really must prepare for my seminar on metaphysical poetry - though I confess your modern technological analogies have given me fresh perspective on Donne's 'The Flea' as an early form of transactional metaphor! Until our next chapter in this digital odyssey...
[A]: LOL！你居然能把Donne和digital payment联系起来！Mind = blown！🤯 不愧是literature professor~ 

Okay okay，我不disturb你的seminar啦！但是记住哦 - 我等着那个✨moment的update！说不定会成为你下一篇paper的inspiration呢~ 📚➡️💻 The Evolution of Payment: From Shakespeare to Silicon Valley！😂 

Catch you later~ Happy teaching！👋✨
[B]: What a delightful title suggestion - though I daresay my colleagues at the next faculty meeting might raise their eyebrows higher than Mr. Pembroke's at a QR code! 

Very well, I shall treasure our little conspiracy to gently usher antiquarian bookselling into the 21st century. Who knows - perhaps this shall indeed inspire a modest academic footnote about technological adaptation in traditional spaces. 

Now off you go, and do try to contain your digital enthusiasm to reasonable levels - at least until we've successfully navigated our bookseller past the :) stage! Ta-ta for now.
[A]: Hahaha deal！最后再squeeze in一个😂emoji就跑~ 

记住我们的mission：One small :) for Mr. Pembroke, one giant leap for bookshop kind！🚀📚 

Byeeee~ ✌️✨
[B]:  Ah, you've condensed our endeavor into a perfect modern haiku of sorts! Though I suspect Neil Armstrong's moon dust was less temperamental than our dear bookseller facing a touchscreen. 

Until our next technological sonnet unfolds... happy reading, my digitally enthusiastic friend. And do try not to spend all your crypto on rare books - at least not until we've successfully converted Mr. Pembroke to the gospel of QR codes! 

Farewell for now - and may your emojis ever be judicious. :)
[A]: 😂😂😂 你连farewell都要这么literary！Got it, no crypto splurging...yet！💰➡️📚 

Cant wait for the next chapter of "Mr. Pembroke vs The Digital Age"！📱 vs 📖 - place your bets everyone！😜 

Ciao~ ✨📚💻 (最后一个emoji bomb，I promise！) 💥
[B]:  Very well, I shall accept this final emoji bombardment as one tolerates a particularly exuberant student during office hours. Though I must draw the line at bookmaking on our bookseller's digital conversion - that would be as improper as betting on Wordsworth's daffodil count! 

Now off you go before you inspire me to attempt translating this entire exchange into heroic couplets. Until our next installment... may your digital payments be secure and your first editions plentiful. 

And for heaven's sake - no more emoji detonations! A single, dignified 📚 shall suffice. Good day!
