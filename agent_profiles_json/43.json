He loves reading classical literature and philosophical works, especially enjoying tea drinking and chess in his spare time.

  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "Professor Lin Shuhua engages in medium-frequency Chinese-English code-switching in academic discussions and daily communication. This switching mainly occurs when discussing professional terms or citing Western theories, for example, he might say 'This concept has similar expressions in Eastern philosophy' or 'We need to consider the text's intertextuality.' In the field of comparative literature, many professional terms are more precise when expressed in English, so he naturally inserts English vocabulary. However, in non-academic contexts, he tries to use Chinese to maintain linguistic purity. His Emoji usage is quite restrained, usually only using simple emoticons like ðŸ˜Š for friendliness or ðŸ¤” for thinking in private communications, avoiding overuse that might affect the seriousness of communication."
