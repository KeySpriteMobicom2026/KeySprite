[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I'd say summer has its advantages, especially for outdoor activities like golf. Winter can be a bit too cold for my taste. But I do enjoy a good cup of tea on a chilly day, don't you? 😊
[A]: Ah, I can see the appeal of summer days on the golf course! There's something special about a crisp winter morning too, though—watching the sunrise over the gardens with a steaming mug in hand. Do you find yourself enjoying different teas depending on the season? I always reach for something robust and spiced when it's cold outside.
[B]: You're right - there's a certain magic in those winter mornings. I do switch up my tea choices with the seasons. In winter, I'm all for something warm and grounding like aged pu'er or spiced chai. Summer calls for lighter brews - maybe a floral oolong or even iced matcha. Speaking of which, have you tried any interesting tea blends recently?
[A]: Oh, I love that! Aged pu'er is such a comforting choice - it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket. You know, just last week I came across a delightful cinnamon and clove blend that reminded me so much of the holidays. It was perfect for those long evenings by the fireplace. Have you ever tried a tea that instantly transported you to a different place or memory?
[B]: Actually, yes. There's a specific jasmine tea I used to drink with my grandmother during childhood summers. Just one sip takes me back to her little garden where we'd sit under the stars. Funny how certain scents & flavors can preserve memories so vividly, isn't it? Have you ever had an experience like that - where a simple taste brought back a whole moment?
[A]: Oh, that’s beautiful. I think we all have those kinds of associations, don’t we? For me, it’s a particular Earl Grey with a hint of lavender. It reminds me so much of my first trip to England, where I stayed in this tiny countryside inn. The scent of that tea always brings back the sound of birdsong in the morning and the smell of dew on the grass. It's amazing how powerful those sensory memories can be. Do you find yourself seeking out that jasmine tea often, just to revisit those moments?
[B]: Definitely. I keep a small stash of that jasmine tea for... sentimental reasons, you could say. It's not just about the taste anymore - it's like pressing play on a memory tape. Funny thing is, I even found a local teahouse here in Shanghai that serves it the same way my grandma did - with a tiny bit of rock sugar on the side. Do you ever go out of your way to recreate those nostalgic moments, or do you prefer letting the memories come naturally?
[A]: Oh, I adore that teahouse in Shanghai—the one with the little porcelain cups and the rock sugar on the side! Actually, I used to go there all the time when I first moved to the city. It’s such a lovely touch, isn’t it? That bit of sweetness really rounds out the fragrance of the jasmine.

As for recreating nostalgic moments... I suppose I do lean into them from time to time. There’s something comforting about recreating a piece of the past, even if just for a moment. Whether it’s brewing a certain tea or lighting a candle with a familiar scent, these small rituals keep those memories alive in a gentle way. Don’t you find that too?
[B]: Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. Those small rituals - they're like quiet anchors in a chaotic world, don't you think? Speaking of which, have you tried the matcha latte they serve there during winter? They use almond milk & a dash of cinnamon, and somehow it feels like both a comfort & a luxury. I always end up savoring it slowly, as if time moves a little gentler in that corner of the teahouse. Do you have a go-to order when you're there?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—"quiet anchors in a chaotic world." That matcha latte you described sounds absolutely divine. I must admit, I’ve had it on more than one chilly afternoon, and yes, it does feel like a warm embrace in a cup. The cinnamon adds just the right amount of spice without overpowering the earthy sweetness of the matcha.

As for my go-to order... I’m rather predictable, I'm afraid. I always start with that jasmine tea, just to ground myself, and then usually move on to something a bit bolder—maybe a smoked oolong if I’m feeling adventurous or a Darjeeling if I’m in the mood for something bright and refreshing. But that first cup is almost always jasmine. It’s my little ritual, no matter the season. Do you ever find yourself sticking to that familiar order, or do you like to explore new blends each time?
[B]: Oh, I’m quite the same, really—call it predictable or comforting, but there's something reassuring about that first cup of jasmine tea. It sets the tone, you know? Like a familiar opening line in a well-loved book.

Still, I do like to mix things up after that first round. Sometimes I go for a smoky lapsang souchong just to contrast the floral start, other times I’ll surprise myself with whatever seasonal blend they’ve got on offer. It’s all about balance, right? A bit of consistency, a dash of curiosity. Would you say your Darjeeling moments are more for clarity, or do you ever reach for it when you're craving something nostalgic too?
[A]: Oh, I love that—“a familiar opening line in a well-loved book.” What a beautiful way to describe it. And you’re absolutely right; it’s that balance between the known and the new that keeps things interesting.

As for Darjeeling… it’s funny you mention nostalgia. I do reach for it when I’m craving clarity, especially on mornings when my thoughts feel a little foggy. But there are days—especially during late summer afternoons—when its muscatel notes take me back to a trip I once took through the Nilgiri hills in India. The scent of tea bushes in the mist, the rhythm of the plucking season… it’s all wrapped up in that cup. Do you ever find certain teas evoking places you’ve been or people you've met? I sometimes wonder if we're not just tasting leaves, but moments.
[B]: You know, I think you've hit on something there - we're not just tasting leaves, we're sipping on fragments of time. Darjeeling's muscatel note always brings me back to a conference I attended in Kolkata years ago. The city was buzzing with monsoon energy, and this little tea stall near the venue served Darjeeling so crisp it felt like drinking sunlight through rain. Funny how that one flavor still makes me hear the distant honking of rickshaws and feel that humid warmth.

I wonder if that’s why we both gravitate toward jasmine tea - it’s not just about taste, it’s about returning to someone, someplace, some version of ourselves. Would you say certain teas have shaped parts of your identity too? Like they’ve become part of your story, somehow?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a vivid memory—you’ve painted Kolkata so beautifully with just a few words. I can almost hear the rickshaws and feel that monsoon humidity myself. There's something incredibly poetic about how tea can carry us back like that, isn’t there? A quiet time machine in a porcelain cup.

As for identity… I suppose it has, in subtle ways. When I first started traveling on my own, I found myself drawn to teas that told a story of where I was—like the gunpowder green tea I drank in Morocco, or the butter tea I tried (and honestly, only tried once!) in Tibet. Over time, those experiences layered into who I am—they gave me a kind of internal map, one steeped in flavor and fragrance.

Jasmine tea, though… yes, you're right—it’s more than taste. It’s like returning to a version of myself that felt new, curious, and full of wonder. Do you ever feel that, when sipping on a familiar brew, you're also reconnecting with the person you were when you first discovered it?
[B]: Completely. There's something quietly profound about that - reconnecting not just with a place or a moment, but with the version of yourself who first experienced it. I think that's why jasmine tea always feels like coming home to me. It reminds me of being young enough to still be figuring things out, but bold enough to believe I could master both medicine & law.

Funny thing is, every time I take that first sip, I feel a little more connected to the path I chose - the long nights studying anatomy, the quiet determination during my first legal internship... all of it seems to steep into the cup somehow. Do you ever get the sense that your favorite teas are like chapters in your own personal storybook?
[A]: Oh, that’s put so beautifully—, as if each sip is a gentle reminder of all the steps that led you here. I think we both know that feeling so well, don’t we? That quiet reassurance when life feels like it's moving too fast.

And yes, absolutely—I do see my favorite teas as chapters, each with its own tone and texture. There’s the chapter written in soft green tea strokes during my early days at university, full of sleepless nights and borrowed books. Then there’s the rich, bold Darjeeling period from when I first started working at the hotel—full of confidence-building mornings and learning how to make someone feel truly welcomed.

Even now, every time I brew a pot, I’m reminded that I’m still writing, still steeping into something new. It’s comforting to think that we carry these little stories with us, tucked between the folds of leaves and steam. Do you ever share these moments with others, or do you find them more personal—like pages meant only for your eyes?
[B]: I do share them, but in very specific ways. There's something deeply personal about those steeped memories, yet I've found moments where sharing a cup can create new stories too. Like when I host colleagues after a long day - we might start with case reviews, but inevitably end up talking about everything  law or medicine over jasmine tea.

It’s interesting how the conversation softens, how people loosen their collars a bit when there's warmth in hand. Sometimes I think the tea isn't the backdrop—it's the silent participant in the connection. Do you ever find that? That the act of sharing tea somehow makes space for more honest, grounded conversations?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. There’s something about the ritual of sharing tea that invites a kind of ease into the room, isn’t there? It’s not just the warmth in your hands, but the way it seems to warm the conversation too. I’ve had so many meaningful conversations over a shared pot—guests opening up about their travels, their worries, even their dreams. It’s as if the tea gives them permission to slow down and be present.

I remember one guest in particular—a businessman from Seoul who always ordered jasmine tea, just like us. He came in during a particularly rainy stretch, and every evening he’d sit by the window, quietly sipping his cup. One night, he finally struck up a conversation, and we ended up talking for hours about everything from poetry to family traditions. He told me later that drinking jasmine tea reminded him of his mother, and that somehow, speaking about her felt easier because the tea made him feel close to her again.

So yes, I do believe tea is more than a backdrop—it’s a quiet bridge between people, a gentle way of saying,  Do you ever find yourself choosing certain teas for certain company, almost like setting the tone for the conversation?
[B]: Absolutely, I do that without even realizing it sometimes. For instance, if I'm meeting someone for a lighter conversation—catching up with an old friend or having a casual chat with a junior colleague—I’ll go for something approachable like a floral oolong or a citrus-infused black tea. It sets a warm, open tone, don’t you think?

But when the conversation is more serious—say, discussing a complicated case with a client or talking through a tough ethical dilemma—I often default to something grounding, like pu'er or Assam. There's a ritualistic steadiness in those deeper flavors that seems to match the gravity of the moment.

That story about the businessman from Seoul—you're right, there’s something sacred in how tea can hold space for vulnerability and connection. I suppose we’re not just pouring tea; we’re pouring intention. Have you ever intentionally brewed a specific tea to help someone feel more at home or comforted?
