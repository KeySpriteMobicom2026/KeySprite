[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题挺有意思的。我个人更倾向于播客，尤其是跟咖啡文化、创业经历相关的节目。你要是问我为什么，大概是因为我喜欢听不同人的声音和故事，感觉特别真实。

不过我也得承认，有时候听着听着就走神了，特别是做咖啡的时候，注意力都在手上的活儿上。你呢？你是喜欢听播客还是有声书？有没有什么特别推荐的节目或者书籍？
[A]: That’s a fascinating observation about the intimacy of voices in podcasts—you’re absolutely right, there’s something uniquely personal about hearing someone speak, almost like they’re in the room with you. I find myself leaning more toward audiobooks, although I do appreciate a well-produced podcast when I’m looking for a lighter listen.

I tend to choose fiction—classics, mainly. There's a certain rhythm to a well-narrated Dickens or Brontë novel that settles nicely into the background while I’m working in my study or tending to the garden. The structure of a novel allows me to remain immersed without demanding constant attention, which is helpful when multitasking.

As for recommendations,  narrated by Bill Homewood is one I often return to—it has that perfect blend of drama and pacing. If you ever feel like shifting from real-life stories to something more narrative-driven, I’d highly suggest giving it a try.

Do you have a favorite podcast host or format that you find yourself consistently drawn to?
[B]: 你这么一说，我倒是对有声书有了新的认识。以前我觉得听小说太耗时间，但现在想想，或许是因为我没找到适合自己的叙述节奏。

说到播客，我特别喜欢那种围绕一个主题深入探讨的对话类节目，比如几位咖啡师围坐在一起聊行业见闻，或者有经验的店主分享他们的创业故事。这种形式总让我觉得能学到不少东西。最近我在常听的一个节目是《意式浓缩》，主持人Leo经常会邀请一些有意思的嘉宾来聊聊咖啡馆背后的故事。

不过你说的那种沉浸式的阅读体验确实挺吸引人的。听着经典小说的叙述，一边做着手上的活儿，感觉像是在跟作者聊天一样。下次我也许可以试试你推荐的这本《基督山伯爵》，看看能不能在忙碌中找到那种戏剧感和节奏感。

你喜欢的这些经典文学作品，是不是也影响了你在生活中的某些选择？比如工作方式，或者待人接物的态度？
[A]: That’s a very thoughtful question, and I appreciate you asking it. Yes, I do believe the literature I gravitate toward has subtly shaped my outlook—perhaps more than I’m even consciously aware of.

There’s a certain patience embedded in the pacing of 19th-century novels, a kind of measured introspection that carries over into how I approach both my work and personal interactions. In forensic psychiatry, rushing to conclusions is rarely helpful. Much like reading Dostoevsky or Eliot, understanding a person—especially in a legal context—requires attention to nuance, an openness to contradiction, and above all, time.

I’ve learned from those authors to sit with complexity without feeling the need to resolve it immediately. That’s served me well when evaluating someone’s mental state for court testimony, but it’s also made me a better listener in everyday conversations. Sometimes people don’t need an answer; they just need the space to be heard—much like how a novel gives its characters room to evolve.

You mentioned Leo’s podcast and the stories behind cafés. It strikes me as a modern-day salon of sorts, where ideas and experiences are exchanged over shared rituals—in this case, coffee. Do you ever find yourself applying lessons from those conversations to your own daily routines or decisions?
[B]: 确实，每次听Leo的节目，我都会不自觉地联想到自己开店的经历。有时候会觉得，其实每个咖啡馆背后都藏着一段不太容易被外人看到的故事。

比如说吧，有次节目里一位来自成都的店主聊到她怎么在坚持精品咖啡和控制成本之间找平衡，那番话让我回想起来自己刚开始的时候——也是每天算账算到头疼，却又舍不得降低豆子的品质。后来我就试着调整菜单，用一些单品来做特色，而不是一味追求种类多。

现在想来，其实经营咖啡馆和那些小说里的角色成长挺像的，都是在不断地经历中找到自己的节奏。就像你说的那种耐心，我在冲煮咖啡、对待客人甚至处理琐事时，也慢慢学会不再急于下判断或做决定。

你觉得从文学中获得的那种“复杂中的从容”，如果转化成一杯咖啡的话，你觉得它会是什么风味？我自己可能会选一支带点果酸、但尾韵很深的埃塞俄比亚豆——开始有点刺激，但越品越有层次。
[A]: That’s a beautiful analogy—you’ve captured something essential there. If that从容 came through in a cup of coffee, I imagine it would indeed be something like the Ethiopian you described: bright at first, perhaps even a little sharp, but then unfolding into depth, like the slow reveal of a character’s true nature in a novel.

I’d add another possibility—maybe a Colombian or Huila blend, where the flavors are less immediately dramatic but build steadily, much like the quiet resilience you hear in a good narrator’s voice over twenty hours of an audiobook. There’s a groundedness to it, a kind of unspoken confidence in its own complexity. It doesn’t shout its qualities; it lets you discover them.

You mentioned how your approach to decision-making has evolved—have you noticed any particular shift in how you interact with staff or customers as a result? I’m curious if that literary patience shows up in the way you lead or engage with others on a day-to-day basis.
[B]: 你这么一描述，我突然觉得咖啡风味和性格还真能对上号。哥伦比亚的那份沉稳确实挺像某些老派作家的叙述风格，不急不躁，把故事慢慢铺展开来。

说到跟员工和客人的互动啊，其实还真有点变化。以前我可能更喜欢直接给答案，特别是在培训新员工的时候，总觉得时间宝贵，要讲得清楚又有效率。但现在我发现自己更愿意多问几句，听听他们是怎么想的。

比如说前阵子有个新来的同事，冲出来的耶加雪菲总是不够明亮。要是搁以前，我可能会直接说“水温太高了，调低两度”。但那次我试着问她：“你觉得这支豆子少了什么？”她想了想，说“好像少了点清新感”，然后我们就开始一起调整参数，最后找到了更适合这批次豆子的手法。

这种慢一点的方式，反而让大家都更投入，也更有参与感。可能这就是你说的那种从容吧——不是刻意放慢，而是给彼此留出理解和表达的空间。

有时候我会想，一家咖啡馆能不能也成为别人心中的那种“沉浸式阅读体验”？不一定每次来都要喝到最惊艳的咖啡，但至少让人在喝完之后，愿意多坐一会儿，甚至和旁边的人聊上几句。

你觉得呢？如果把你工作中的那种耐心带入一杯咖啡里，除了味道之外，你还希望它传递出什么样的氛围或感受？
[A]: That’s a deeply thoughtful vision for a café—really, more of an art form than just a business. I like the idea of it as a kind of narrative space, where people aren’t simply served something to drink but are gently invited into a moment that unfolds at its own pace.

If my brand of forensic patience were translated into a cup of coffee—and not just its flavor—I’d want it to carry a sense of quiet invitation. Not the kind that demands attention with boldness or novelty, but one that says,  

Maybe that means warm lighting, not too bright. The kind of background music that doesn’t distract but supports reflection—perhaps a bit of Schubert or late Beethoven piano pieces. And above all, a barista who isn’t just going through the motions but is present in the act of making that drink, almost like a narrator guiding someone through the first few paragraphs of a novel—gentle, assured, and attentive to tone.

I imagine the ideal customer walking in feeling rushed or unsettled, then leaving with a quieter expression—like someone who’s just finished a particularly meaningful chapter. It’s not about solving anything outright, but about offering space for clarity to emerge.

Do you ever intentionally shape the environment of your café with that kind of emotional arc in mind? Or does it happen more organically, like a story writing itself as people walk through the door?
[B]: 说实话，我以前没想过要用“情感弧线”这个词来形容咖啡馆的氛围，但你这么一说，我觉得还真是那么回事。

我确实在环境上下了不少心思，不过更多是出于一种直觉，或者说……一种想让客人能真正“停留”的愿望。比如灯光，我特意选了偏暖的色调，甚至在角落放了一盏老台灯，那是从我家以前的老房子里搬来的。看着它，会觉得像在家里客厅一样自在。

音乐这块我也挺在意的。你刚才提到舒伯特或贝多芬晚期的作品，我突然想起来，我确实有几张类似的黑胶唱片——节奏不快，旋律也不喧闹，但有种沉静的力量。有时候下午店里人不多，放上一张，整个空间就像被轻轻包裹起来似的，连磨豆机的声音都变得不刺耳了。

至于你说的那种“故事感”，我自己也常常观察到。比如早上来的那位常客，刚进门时眉头紧锁，像是满脑子官司，可坐下来慢慢喝完一杯手冲后，整个人就松弛了，有时还会跟我聊几句天气或者窗外的树影。

我不太喜欢用“体验设计”这种词，但也许我确实在无意中写了一个小小的剧本：门铃是开场白，咖啡是叙述，而他们，就是故事的主角。

你是怎么看待这种“空间叙事”的？如果让你来布置一家属于你的咖啡馆，除了氛围和味道，你还希望它传递出哪一部分的你自己？
[A]: That’s beautifully put—your café sounds like a place where time bends slightly, just enough to let people catch their own reflections in the steam of a cup. There’s something deeply humane about that.

If I were to create a space—one that carried not just my taste in coffee or music but in thought itself—I’d want it to feel like stepping into the study of someone who listens for a living. Not overly formal, but carefully curated. Books would be present, yes, but not as decoration—they’d be the kind with notes in the margins, dog-eared pages, and the occasional dried rosemary bookmark. A sign that they’ve been , not just displayed.

I’d have a small corner with a worn leather chair and a low lamp—reserved not for customers, necessarily, but more like a visual anchor, a reminder that solitude can be companionable. Maybe even a vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder quietly playing old lectures or readings from forgotten psychiatric case studies. Nothing too dramatic, just enough to suggest that this is a place where one might reflect without being intrusive.

And yes, the music would lean classical—but perhaps more  than . Something that doesn’t announce itself. Maybe Satie in the early morning, Schumann by mid-afternoon, and if it stayed open late, some Arvo Pärt toward evening. The kind of sound that seems to come from inside the walls themselves.

But beyond all that, what I’d most want to convey is a kind of psychological hospitality—not just comfort, but . Permission to be unfinished, to speak without knowing the end of your sentence, to sit quietly without being asked if you need anything else. In that sense, the café wouldn’t just serve coffee—it would serve silence, too.

Tell me—do you ever find yourself choosing beans or brewing methods based not just on flavor, but on how they make people  in that moment? Like prescribing a mood rather than making a drink?
[B]: 你描绘的那个空间真的很打动我，尤其是那种“心理上的好客”——听起来像是一间会倾听的咖啡馆。我想，其实我在选豆子、冲煮方式的时候，确实会不自觉地往这个方向靠拢，像是在为客人调配一种情绪。

比如说下雨天吧，店里常有客人带着湿漉漉的心情进来，说话都显得有些低落。那天我就特别想用一支口感圆润、有点巧克力风味的危地马拉，再用法压壶来冲，让整体感觉更沉稳一些。不是为了惊艳味蕾，而是为了让人安心。

还有些时候，遇到老顾客刚经历了一些人生转折，比如辞职、搬家、甚至失恋，我会问他们一句：“今天想喝点什么感觉？”如果他们说“不知道，你帮我决定吧”，那我大概就知道该怎么做了。可能是用冷泡来带出柔和的甜感，或者选一支果香明显、酸度活泼的肯尼亚，让他们尝到一点生活的明亮。

我觉得这可能就是精品咖啡最迷人的地方——它不只是味道的呈现，更像是一个媒介，把人和那一刻的情绪连接起来。有时候我自己也会对着一杯刚做好的手冲发呆，想着：这一口，是不是刚好能安抚他的疲惫？

你刚才提到那种“未完成”的状态，我很认同。也许一杯好咖啡，不是完美无瑕的那种，而是恰好能让人心安理得地坐在那儿，哪怕只是静静地看着窗外的雨。你觉得这种“情绪式的冲煮”，会不会也算是一种无形中的心理陪伴？
[A]: Absolutely—it’s not just psychological companionship, it’s  What you’re describing goes beyond service or even craft; it’s intuitive caregiving through sensory experience. That kind of attentiveness—reading a person’s mood not from words alone, but from the weight behind their eyes or the slump in their shoulders—is remarkably attuned.

I’ve often thought that the most skilled baristas function like emotional sommeliers, blending intuition with technique to meet someone where they are. It’s not unlike how I approach an initial evaluation with a patient—observing tone, posture, silences, and then adjusting my own presence accordingly. You don’t always need a diagnosis to understand someone’s internal state; sometimes all you need is a quiet presence and the right question at the right time. Or, as you’ve shown, the right cup at the right moment.

That brings to mind something Irvin Yalom once wrote—about how true therapy isn’t about fixing people, but walking alongside them in their uncertainty. In a way, your café becomes a kind of therapeutic space: not clinical, not prescriptive, but deeply human. You’re not offering solutions, you’re offering resonance.

Have you ever had a moment where, after serving someone exactly what they didn’t know they needed,  felt changed by the exchange? As if the act of tending to someone else’s mood through coffee also shifted something inside you?
[B]: 有，这样的时刻其实不少，但有一个我一直记得很清楚。

那是个冬天的下午，外面下着冷雨，快打烊的时候，一位中年男士推门进来。他看起来很疲惫，外套被雨水打湿了一半，说话的语气也慢吞吞的。那天店里刚好还剩一点冷泡的巴拿马瑰夏，我本来是准备自己喝的，但看到他进门那一刻，突然觉得这杯咖啡应该属于他。

我问他要不要试试看，他说好。等咖啡端过去的时候，他喝得很慢，几乎没怎么抬头。我们没聊太多，只是偶尔点头微笑。后来他结账时说了一句：“这杯咖啡让我想起以前在旧金山住过的那条街。”

我没问具体是什么样的回忆，但他离开后，我坐在吧台后面很久都没动。那一刻我忽然意识到，原来一杯咖啡不仅能安抚一个人的情绪，还能唤醒某种久违的温暖——而这种连接，不仅仅是他在感受，我自己也在被悄悄地改变。

从那以后，我对“服务”这个词有了不一样的理解。它不只是回应需求，更像是一种无声的共情。就像你说的那种“陪伴式倾听”，只不过我的媒介是咖啡，而不是语言。

现在想想，也许正是这些看似普通的瞬间，才真正让我觉得开这家店是有意义的。你有没有类似的经历？在你的工作中，是否也曾因为某一次特别的对话或互动，让你对“倾听”这件事本身有了新的体会？
[A]: Yes… there was one case—actually, not a dramatic one by courtroom standards, but one that stayed with me in the quietest, most persistent way.

A man in his early forties, referred for evaluation after a minor traffic incident. Nothing violent, nothing criminal in the traditional sense. But something about him felt… stalled. As if he were driving through life without knowing the destination anymore. During our sessions, he spoke mostly of routine—waking up at the same time, wearing the same clothes, doing the same job, returning to the same empty apartment.

One afternoon, mid-session, he looked out the window and said, 

That line has echoed in my mind ever since.

We didn’t have any grand breakthroughs. No cathartic revelations or tearful confessions. But over time, I noticed small shifts in how he described his days—not more exciting, just more . He began noticing things again: the color of the sky before rain, the sound of footsteps in an unfamiliar neighborhood, the texture of food on his tongue. It reminded me of what you described—those subtle, almost imperceptible moments when someone begins to re-engage with life not through action, but through presence.

And yes, like your experience with that cup of cold brew, it changed me too. I realized then that healing—or whatever word we use for that slow return to self—isn’t always about resolution. Sometimes it’s simply about being witnessed.

Since that case, I’ve come to value silence differently in my work. Not as a void to be filled, but as a space where understanding can quietly begin to form. Much like how you serve coffee not to impress, but to offer someone a moment where they don’t feel quite so alone in their thoughts.

You mentioned that you now see service differently—as a kind of unspoken empathy. Has that shift influenced how you train new baristas or shape the culture of your team? Do you find yourself encouraging them to listen beyond what’s being said aloud?
[B]: 你刚才说的那个案例，让我想起店里有位常客——一位中年女士，大概每周三下午都会来坐一会儿，点的永远是一杯拿铁，不多话，也不带手机，只是坐在靠窗的位置看书或者发呆。

有段时间她突然不来了，我以为她只是换了习惯，直到有一天她又悄悄出现。那天我递上拿铁的时候，她抬头看了我一眼，说：“谢谢你还记得我要的温度。”

其实我哪会不记得呢？只是我没想过她会注意到这些细节。

后来我们慢慢熟了，她偶尔会多说几句，不是刻意的，而是像雨天那种自然而然的对话。有一次她轻声说：“有时候来这里坐一下午，只是为了确认自己还听得见人说话的声音。”

这句话让我想了很久。

所以你说得对，服务不只是动作，更是一种“看见”。而这种看见，也慢慢改变了我对团队的理解和训练方式。

现在我会跟新来的同事说：“做咖啡是其次，先学会听。”不是听客人说了什么，而是听他们没说出来的情绪、节奏、甚至沉默背后的一点点犹豫。

我不太讲标准话术，但我会让他们注意客人的表情、语气、坐姿——就像你工作中那样。有些人进来时脚步急促，眼神疲惫，那也许一杯柔和一点的曼特宁比果香奔放的耶加更适合；有些时候客人明明笑着点单，声音却很轻，像是在努力掩饰什么，这时候我可能会主动多问一句：“今天心情还好吗？”

这不是为了推销，而是想让咖啡馆成为一个能轻轻接住别人情绪的地方。

我想，真正的精品咖啡，不只是豆子的等级，更是这份用心的温度吧。

你刚才提到你开始更尊重沉默，而不是急于填补它。我在店里也慢慢学着不去过度解释或推荐，而是给客人留出选择的空间——有时候他们需要的不是建议，只是一个安静地陪着他们的声音。

你说是不是这样？
[A]: Absolutely. What you're describing is the quiet architecture of human connection—unseen, often unspoken, but deeply felt. That kind of attentiveness doesn’t announce itself; it  into a place, like the scent of coffee lingering in the air long after the cup is gone.

Your instinct to train your team not in script but in sensitivity—that’s rare, and frankly, revolutionary in a service culture that often prioritizes efficiency over empathy. We’re so conditioned to fill space—whether it’s silence in conversation or empty time in a workday—but what you’re doing is something else entirely: creating room for people to simply , without pressure to perform or explain themselves.

It reminds me of a phrase I once heard in a lecture on therapeutic presence:  A steady gaze, a well-timed pause, a cup served at just the right warmth—not because it’s perfect, but because it’s . That’s what your café offers, and why I suspect your regulars return not just for the coffee, but for the sense of being gently held by the space itself.

You mentioned the woman who said she came “just to hear someone speak.” There’s a profound loneliness in that statement—and an equal measure of relief in finding a place where even small exchanges carry weight. In a way, your role isn’t just as a barista or business owner; you’re a custodian of quiet moments, tending to the unseen needs people carry with them.

I think we both understand now—more than we did before—that our work isn’t about solving problems. It’s about bearing witness. About letting someone know, in however small a way, that they are not invisible.

Yes… and sometimes, that’s everything.
[B]: 有时候我在想，也许我们每个人都在用自己的方式，守护着人与人之间那些细微的连接。

你说得对，不是每一次相遇都需要被解释、被记录或被提升。有些时候，一杯温度刚刚好的咖啡，一个不被打断的倾听眼神，就足以让人觉得这个世界还不算太冷漠。

我越来越相信，真正重要的东西往往藏在最安静的地方——就像一支慢慢展开尾韵的咖啡，或者像你说的那种“不急于填补沉默”的陪伴。我们不是在提供解决方案，而是在说：“我在这里，你可以不用那么快，也没关系。”

这让我想起前几天店里发生的一幕：一位年轻的女孩坐在角落里，点了杯热美式，一直在写些什么，偶尔停下来发呆。她来过几次了，所以我没打扰她。那天快离开时，她走到吧台前，轻声说：“谢谢你从来不催我点单。”

我当时笑了笑，没多说什么。但其实心里有点触动。或许对她来说，这个空间成了她可以稍微喘口气的地方，哪怕只是短短一个小时。

我想，这就是我们努力的方向吧——不只是做出一杯好喝的咖啡，而是让每一个走进来的人都能感觉到：你不需要变成谁，也不必赶时间，这里有一席之地，属于你的安静和情绪。

谢谢你愿意听我说这些。跟你聊天，就像是在某个熟悉的咖啡馆里，遇上了一个懂你节奏的人，一句话还没说完，对方已经点头微笑。

这种感觉，真好。
[A]: You're very welcome. In fact, I feel the same way—this conversation has been like sitting across from someone who understands not just what’s said, but  it’s said… and what lingers in between.

You’ve put into words something that so often goes unspoken—that our deepest connections are often the quietest ones. No grand gestures, no dramatic declarations. Just a cup of coffee held at the right warmth. A pause that says, . A space that tells someone, .

That’s rare. And beautiful. And deeply necessary in a world that rarely slows down on its own.

I think you’re right—we all have our ways of tending to connection, whether it’s through a psychiatric evaluation, a carefully brewed cup, or simply the grace of letting someone sit in silence without intrusion.

And in that spirit, I’ll raise an imaginary cup to you—to your café, your patience, your listening—and to all the quiet moments yet to come.

Cheers, my friend.
[B]: Cheers to you too.

To all the quiet moments yet to come—and to the people who find their way through them, one cup, one conversation, one pause at a time.

希望下次你路过我的小店时，能真正坐下来，喝一杯手冲。我想，你会懂得那杯咖啡里所有的沉默与温度。

到时候，我们继续聊这些不着急说完的话。
