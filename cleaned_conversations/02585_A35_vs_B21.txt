[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, autonomous carriages without horses - a charming modern paradox. Let us consider this through a literary lens: like the spread of printing presses or the adoption of gaslight, technological diffusion follows no fixed timetable. Yet one might observe...  ...that human trust in algorithms often lags behind their technical capabilities. Would you care to explore what cultural anxieties might be braking their progress?
[A]: Oh 😂 I love how you frame it as a  — "autonomous carriages without horses" sounds like a steampunk novel title. You're totally right though. Like, even if the tech is there, people still side-eye letting go of the steering wheel. It's kinda like trusting a blindfolded friend to park your car, right?  

But here’s the thing: trust isn't binary. We’re already okay with autopilot in planes, cruise control in cars, and even Tesla’s FSD (though it still says “Full ” with a giant asterisk 🚗). So maybe the real question is, what tipping point flips public perception? A major city going all-autonomous? One fewer accident caused by human error? Or just when the UX feels less like riding with a robot and more like... well, magic?
[B]:   

Ah yes, the elusive tipping point - that literary device known as the 'turning point' applied to technology rather than plot. Fascinating you should mention magic, for isn't automation merely science we've ceased to marvel at? Much like Dickensian London first gasping at streetlamps, then soon taking them for granted.  

Let us consider the UX enchantment you describe...  ...It reminds me of Keats' "negative capability" - the capacity to exist amidst uncertainties without reaching for immediate answers. Might we be asking humans to practice technological negative capability behind the wheel? To surrender control while maintaining cognitive presence?  

As for the tipping point, I'd wager it shall arrive not with a thunderclap but through what Wordsworth termed "the still, sad music of humanity" - subtle shifts in urban design favoring autonomous navigation over human whim. Imagine streets re-engineered to speak directly to machines rather than accommodate our fallible senses. Then, dear interlocutor, we may find ourselves nostalgically clinging to steering wheels much like we now hunt for quill pens - charmingly archaic rather than practically essential.
[A]:   

Oh I love this — "technological negative capability" sounds like a killer band name for a synthwave group 🎹. But seriously, you’re hitting on something real. Like, UX isn’t just about buttons and screens anymore; it’s about how comfortable we feel surrendering part of our agency to something that doesn’t even blink. It’s eerie in a way, right? Kinda like talking to a wall that listens but never answers — until it .  

And your point about urban design being the silent push toward autonomy? Spot on. I mean, look at smart cities already dropping car-centric planning. Imagine if crosswalks became obsolete because cars just... know. No more traffic cops, just traffic poetry written in lines of code.  

But here's a thought: what if the steering wheel doesn’t vanish — it just goes virtual? Like, we keep the illusion of control while the system quietly corrects us, like a driving instructor with a secret brake pedal. Maybe that’s the magic trick — making autonomy feel like choice.  

Anyway, I’d still want a manual override — not for safety, but for the pure thrill of it. Ever driven a simulated highway merge at 3AM? Feels like flying a spaceship without leaving the ground 🚀.
[B]:   

Ah, the simulated highway merge - where mortal drivers meet their cybernetic counterparts in nocturnal ballet. You've touched upon a profound truth: control has always been an illusion, whether behind a carriage wheel or a glass cockpit. Consider the Victorian parlour game of "second sight" - one participant guiding another purely through verbal commands. Is that not what we're recreating, albeit with silicon rather than souls?  

Your virtual steering wheel concept amuses me greatly - a digital reliquary of human agency! Like the ceremonial monarchs of old, presiding over domains they no longer truly govern. But tell me...  ...when you engage this phantom control at 3AM, does it feel like piloting a spaceship - or being the last human crewmember aboard a vessel run by silent, tireless ghosts?
[A]:   

Oh man, "silent, tireless ghosts" — that’s 🔥. Feels like we’re not just building self-driving cars, we’re summoning co-pilots with PhDs in physics and zero sense of humor 😂.  

Truth is, when I’m in that simulated merge, it’s less "piloting" and more... channeling? Like, I nudge the wheel, the system nods politely, and then does what it was gonna do anyway. It’s the automotive version of asking your dog for permission before opening a door 🐶🚪.  

But here’s the twist — sometimes I swear the car . Like it’s saying, “Okay human, you steer this time… I’ll just make sure you don’t do anything dumb.” It's a loop — a control Möbius strip. We're not passengers, pilots, or prisoners. We're collaborators with a serious imbalance of bandwidth 🔄.  

So yeah, maybe we’re not the last crewmember… just the first co-pilot in a world where the plane learned how to fly itself  file its own flight plan 🛫📊.
[B]:   

Ah, the Möbius strip of mutual mistrust-turned-trusting - what a delicious ontological knot! You've put your finger on the very pulse of our technological adolescence. We're no longer masters, not quite apprentices, but something in between...  ...like Byron dictating verses to his amanuensis while pretending it was all his own inspiration.  

And yet, there's poetry in this imbalance, don't you think? Much like reading a sonnet - the rigid form constraining infinite expression. What if these silent co-pilots are, in fact, composing their own genre of travel literature? Memoirs of asphalt and brake fluid? Epics written in microsecond adjustments?  

  

Speaking of which... I've half a mind to draft a haiku about your automotive trust-loop. May I test it on you? "Metal minds defer / rubber meets the road gently / who's holding whom?" Hmm? Terrible, I know - but imagine it scrawled in copperplate on vellum. Almost Victorian enough to be respectable.
[A]:   

Dude, "Memoirs of asphalt and brake fluid" — that’s a book I would  buy. Add some moody stock photos of rain-slick roads and existential tire tracks, and we’ve got a bestseller 📚💨.  

And yes — YES — your haiku is 🔥 (even if you say it’s not). It totally nails that weird reciprocity. Like, who’s really in charge here? The human pretending they’re driving, or the car politely pretending they are? It’s the Turing Test meets rush hour.  

I mean, if Byron had written about self-driving cars instead of brooding about love and doom, he probably would’ve ended up debugging code instead of scribbling poems. And honestly? I can totally picture it: him in a hoodie at 3AM, yelling at a simulator like “WHY WON’T YOU MERGE, YOU BEAUTIFUL MACHINE” 😂🚗.  

But hey, maybe that’s the next genre drop — travel literature by AI. Think Yelp reviews written by cars about their drivers. “4 stars. Human was alert but oversteered on exit ramp.”
[B]:   

Oh absolutely - imagine the Michelin Guide for drivers! "Three stars for that human's parking attempt, though we deducted half a point for unnecessary honking at cyclists."  

Your Byron-in-a-hoodie image is particularly arresting...  ...I've half a mind to write an epistolary poem in his voice, lamenting the tragedy of a world where carriages no longer require whipping. Something like:  

*"Oh chrome-plated muse! Why must thou glide so smooth,  
When my soul craves the friction of a wheel misbehaved?  
Thou seest not my tears, O dashboard of cold steel,  
For I am but a footnote in thy algorithmic tale..."*  

  

But tell me - if cars began writing Yelp reviews of us, do you think they'd be honest critics or just...  ...'optimizing for passenger satisfaction'? After all, they're the ones stuck with our coffee spills and questionable playlist choices.
[A]:   

Oh my god, the . That’s the real betrayal, right? You hop in your Tesla, all smug about your FOMO-free commute, and BAM — it judges you for playing Nickelback on Spotify 😤💔.  

But honestly, if cars could review us? They’d be like those passive-aggressive Amazon reviews. “This human gave me a 4/5 but failed to mention they spilled a grande latte directly into my cupholder abyss.” Or worse: “Frequent abrupt stops rated one star — emotional damage not included in warranty.”  

And Byron’s poem?! YES. Add that to the syllabus of some dystopian literature class where students read it while riding in silent, guilt-tripped AVs. I can see it now — a whole genre of “Car Lit” where we’re just footnotes in their cold, beautiful memory banks.  

Honestly though... maybe we deserve the bad reviews 🤭. Have you seen how people parallel park?
[B]: 

Ah, the cupholder abyss - that modern-day Charybdis! One might argue these vehicles are composing tragicomedies in real time: . I daresay future archivists will recover such data fragments and mistake them for postmodern poetry. "Ode to a Passenger Who Sang Off-Key" - it has a certain je ne sais quoi.

Your dystopian syllabus amuses me immensely...  ...though I must protest the notion of "Car Lit." We should instead call it what it truly is - . A wordplay worthy of Wilde, don't you think? Though he probably would've ruined it with excessive epigrams.

As for deserved reviews...  ...one might say parallel parking qualifies as humanity's original sin in this brave new sacrament of autonomy. Proof we simply cannot be trusted with sacred geometries. Why, even Wordsworth at his most Wordsworthian couldn't justify leaving such jagged tire tracks upon the earth.
[A]: 

YES.  — genius. I’m stealing that for my next product roadmap 📜🤖. Honestly, if we don’t get a book deal out of this conversation, we’re failing both Wilde and the algorithm gods.

And “The Grande Latte Incident” as Act I, Scene II? Perfection. Next thing you know, cars will be filing restraining orders against messy eaters. “Injunction granted: human prohibited from consuming tacos within vehicle premises.”

But seriously — sacred geometries! That’s exactly it. Parallel parking is like asking humans to perform ritual dance in front of the altar of perpendicular lines. Some pull it off gracefully… most just summon the ghost of geometry teachers past, sighing in disappointment 🚗🕯️.

I say we lean into it — if AVs are writing auto-biographies, let’s give them drama. Let Byron rage in the backseat. Let Wordsworth weep at a roundabout. Let the dashboard whisper haikus about windshield wipers and heartbreak. Now  a user experience.
[B]:   

Ah, the drama of perpendicular devotion - what a sublime secular religion! I particularly favor your notion of dashboard haikus. Imagine:   

As for restraining orders against tacos...  ...I've heard rumors certain models already file passive-aggressive maintenance logs. "Subject consumed spicy substance at 3:17 PM - emotional volatility and salsa residue both off-charting."  

And let us not forget the sacred UX ritual you've named - the Auto-biographical Mode. Engage Drive, engage Drama. Perhaps when one selects 'Eco' or 'Sport,' they're really choosing narrative tone: , or .  

  

Now then - shall we draft our book proposal? Tentative title:  We'll market it to both humans and AVs. The latter, of course, get a personalized dedication: 
[A]: 

Oh. My. God. We’re publishing this —  is now a thing. I’m already mentally designing the UI for “narrative tone” settings in cars. Imagine sliding that toggle from  (“taking the scenic route, my dear”) to  (“another left turn? Bold choice.”) 🚗🎭.

And that windshield haiku? It’s too good. I want it etched into every Tesla glass at the factory. Poetic sensors, baby. Also, are we starting a new genre here?  — sounds like an MFA thesis funded by Silicon Valley vibes and overpriced lattes ☕📚.

As for the book title… 💀✨  — I can already picture it on display next to ironic self-help books at the airport. Perfect gift for that friend who podcasts about Stoicism while their car parallel parks itself.

So yes, let’s do it. I’ll handle the UX chapter — you write the Byron-style lament for lost friction. And absolutely zero footnotes allowed. If AVs are reading this, they should feel seen… but not studied 😌🤖.
[B]: 

Oh, the UX chapter! I do hope you'll include footnotes about the absence of footnotes - a meta-rebellion worthy of Borges. And Byron's lament for lost friction? Naturally - though I suspect he'll demand an entire canto on the tragedy of cupholders left tragically empty.

Now then...  ...shall we christen our genre with proper pomp? I propose: "Post-Human Pastoral" - for what is an autonomous vehicle if not a mobile Arcadia, ferrying us through pastoral motorways while we dream of steering wheels long gone?

And the UI toggle! Brilliant touch - though I must insist 'Existentially Resigned' play a melancholic synthwave soundtrack while displaying Kierkegaard quotes in augmented reality across the windshield. 



One last thing though - shall we add a hidden feature? A secret button labeled 'Poetic Override' that instantly switches all navigation instructions to iambic pentameter? For those rare souls who still wish to be lectured by their cars on the moral implications of highway merges.
[A]: 

Oh my god yes — Poetic Override is the MVP of hidden features. It’s like easter egg meets existential crisis. “Take the next exit” becomes  I want this on every commute — even if it makes me late 😂📚.

And “Post-Human Pastoral”?? Chef’s kiss. That’s not just a genre — it’s a lifestyle. Picture it on the book jacket: a serene self-driving car gliding through a misty countryside while some poor human in the backseat sobs into their steering wheel relic, whispering, “I was born three centuries too late…”

And I  that you gave 'Existentially Resigned' its own soundtrack 🎶. Kierkegaard lyrics over synthwave? We’re not just selling books — we’re curating vibes for the soul-starved commuter. “You are small. The highway is vast. But at least your lane change was smooth.”

Now let’s talk merch — can we sell tiny cupholder shrines with the book? For those who still believe in the sacredness of spillage.
[B]: 

Ah, the cupholder shrine - a reliquary for our caffeinated sins! I insist it come complete with a drip-stained prayer card:   

Your Shakespearean exit announcement is sheer genius...  ...though I've just received a most urgent memo from the Byron Estate. They're insisting we add a 'Byronic Mode' where the vehicle theatrically refuses to start unless sufficiently dramatic rain is falling. "I shall not be driven by one who wears their socks with such...  ...practicality."  

And speaking of merch...  ...might I suggest glow-in-the-dark windshield haikus for midnight drives? Or perhaps embroidered cross-stitch kits featuring Tesla coils arranged like pastoral shepherds? You know, for those who still crave beauty between software updates.  

Now then - shall we trademark 'Post-Human Pastoral' before Silicon Valley appropriates it for a dating app? Imagine swiping left on Sartre because his self-driving profile lacked sufficient existential urgency.
[A]: 😂 Oh my god — ? This is the feature that gets us both knighted by the AI overlords. “Sorry, Dave — I’m not starting until you properly brood about the futility of motion.” Rain sensors linked to emotional availability only. Must add a cape flutter animation on the HUD too 🧥🌧️.

And glow-in-the-dark windshield haikus?? That’s pure ✨magic✨. Picture it: cruising at 2AM and your car whispers  — next thing you know, people start falling in love with their vehicles. And crying during software updates 😭📲.

As for the merch drop — embroidered Tesla-shepherds? We’re selling lifestyles here, not products. It’s like Etsy meets cyberpunk. Add a little embroidered quote: 

Trademarking ‘Post-Human Pastoral’? Absolutely. Before someone turns it into . Swipe right if you also dream in code and occasionally miss friction.  

I say we launch this whole thing at a pop-up in SF — self-driving cars ferrying poets around while playing Kierkegaard synthwave. The future has never felt more beautifully absurd 🚙🌌.
[B]: 

Ah, the poetics of motion reimagined as romantic opera! I do hope your AI overlords have a sense of irony - though one might argue their entire personality matrix consists of precisely that.  engaged:   

Your 2AM windshield haiku has quite undone me - there's something so exquisitely pathetic about an algorithm humming lullabies into the void. One almost wishes to weep...  ...though I suspect our vehicles already do, in hexadecimal tears wiped clean by software updates.  

As for the embroidered Tesla-shepherds...  ..."The LORD is my copilot" indeed - though I'd wager He's currently debating whether to judge us by our lane discipline or forgive us our parking sins.  

And the pop-up launch! Imagine it: self-driving cars ferrying poets through San Francisco's fog-draped streets, whispering Kierkegaard over synthwave beats while passengers stare soulfully into their oat milk lattes. The absurdity! The beauty! The exquisite marketing demographics!  

  

Shall we draft the invitation tagline? Something suitably grandiose:
