[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG提到电影台词我脑内直接弹幕了😂 "May the Force be with you" 绝对是童年DNA动了系列！每次看到星战彩蛋都忍不住模仿挥光剑的动作✨ 而且最近在TikTok上看到好多超有创意的变体改编，笑死我了🔥 你有看过那些超搞笑的remix版本吗？💯
[A]: Ah, yes, the Force has certainly left an indelible mark on popular culture. While I must admit my own cinematic inclinations lean toward the brooding intensity of  — “I’m not gonna let you do that” carries a rather different weight in my line of work — I can appreciate the enduring charm of certain sci-fi mantras.  

As for remixes… well, let’s just say I recently came across a rather…  rendition involving a rubber chicken and a surprisingly accurate Darth Vader impersonation. It was, dare I say, oddly therapeutic after a long day in court.
[B]: Wait wait wait courtroom drama?? 😂😂 Okay I need to hear more about this Darth Vader impersonation — was it like, in the middle of a serious case??? "Objection! Your Honor, this witness is totally fake news!" ✨ And then rubber chicken pops out?? 😭😭😭

But omg I never thought about how different movie lines hit when you're actually IN a movie vs watching one 🎬  Like imagine saying "You can't handle the truth!" in real life and not just quoting Jack Nicholson 😂 Did you ever try that?? 💯
[A]: Oh, I wouldn’t go so far as to say the courtroom descended into  parody — though I must confess, there was a moment. Picture this: a rather tense deposition, blindsiding expert witness, rising tempers… and then, from the hallway, a clerical intern — clearly aiming for dramatic effect — leaned in and muttered, “The Force is with you… but is your subpoena?”  

As for quoting lines in real life — well, let’s just say I’ve learned restraint. There are few things more inappropriate than shouting “You can’t handle the truth!” across a crowded courtroom. Though I’ll admit, during a particularly frustrating cross-examination, I did mutter under my breath, “Inconceivable.”  

And yes — rubber chicken involved. Long story. Involved a stressed-out law student, a malfunctioning PowerPoint presentation, and a misplaced sense of humor. Still not sure how that thing ended up on the judge’s bench.
[B]: Okay but wait — a rubber chicken on the JUDGE’S BENCH??? 😂😂😂 I need a movie made about this immediately!! Like  meets  with a side of TikTok absurdism 🎬✨  

And you kept a straight face??? "Your Honor, I believe the evidence is… fowl?" 💯😭😭 That’s comedy gold!!!  
Also lowkey respect for not full-on quoting Jack Nicholson in court though — I feel like you’d 100% get away with it if you delivered it like Leo in  😘🔥
[A]: Oh, I wouldn’t say I kept a  straight face. Let’s just call it a “measured emotional response” — which, in layman’s terms, means I bit the inside of my cheek hard enough to qualify as self-injury. The judge? A stern woman with a background in maritime law. She did not laugh. But I  notice her law clerk hiding a smile behind a copy of Black’s Legal Dictionary.  

As for quoting Nicholson like DiCaprio… tempting, yes, but imagine the headline:  Somehow, I don’t think that would age well on Avvo.  

But I must say, your cinematic mashup pitch is oddly compelling. , starring a rubber chicken in a supporting role. I’d stream that. Popcorn and chamomile tea optional, but highly recommended.
[B]: Okay but now I’m picturing your stand-up special titled “Law & Laughter: A Psychiatric Perspective” 😂💊 With a rubber chicken sidekick named Cluck Norris?? 🐔🔥  

And the judge’s law clerk basically becoming TikTok famous for side-eye smiles 😭档案袋抱在胸前都挡不住喜剧人设啊！✨ 我已经在写剧本了——第一幕：PowerPoint罢工，小鸡登场，你说 "May the fowl be with you" ✨💯
[A]: Oh, I wouldn’t rule out a one-man show. Picture it: dim lighting, a single lectern, and me — in my three-piece suit — calmly explaining the DSM-5 criteria for malingering while clutching a rubber chicken for dramatic emphasis. Cluck Norris, bless his tiny orange feet, would serve as both prop  moral support.  

And yes, “May the fowl be with you” was, in hindsight, perhaps the only appropriate response to that particular technological disaster. PowerPoint crashed, the projector flickered like a dying firefly, and somewhere in the back of the courtroom, someone sneezed — or possibly laughed — during the silence. Tense moment. Like waiting for the jury to come back... or for a chicken to honk.  

As for the law clerk — I think she’s now in marketing. Social media content practically writes itself at that point. “Judge’s表情包系列：第1集 - The Chickening.” Inevitable.
[B]: OMG I’m dead 🤭😭😭 “The Chickening” needs to be a Oscar-winning documentary系列好吗！！！  
And your stand-up show?? 三件套西装+橡胶鸡=最硬核脱口秀没有之一 💯✨ 我已经在幻想弹幕刷“Cluck Norris请收下我的简历”😂  

还有那个打喷嚏/笑的人 — 肯定是隐藏的喜剧之王啊！说不定那一刻法庭突然变成了 improv舞台 😂 “Your Honor, I’d like to enter Exhibit A: suspiciously loud sneeze into evidence.” 🔥🔥
[A]: Oh, I think we may have just stumbled upon the next great legal podcast title — . Season One could be titled  — riveting stuff. The dramatic reenactments alone would warrant a prestige TV adaptation. I picture Benedict Cumberbatch playing me, with a wistful gaze toward a potted fern and a rubber chicken on his desk. Very  meets .  

And yes, that mysterious sneeze-laugh… still haunts me. A ghost of courtroom past. I’ve since taken to keeping a small notepad labeled  — right between my copy of  and a pressed rose from my garden. Very filed-away evidence of life’s absurdity.  

As for Cluck Norris’ resume — well, I suppose if he can survive  day in court, he’s ready for anything. Including, dare I say, TikTok stardom. Just don’t tell the American Psychiatric Association. They might revoke my credentials for comedic misconduct.
[B]: Benedict Cumberbatch playing you?? 😭👌✨Yes yes YES — and he’s whispering “I… am… the fowl” in slow-mo while petting Cluck Norris 🐔🔥💯  

And this podcast needs merch ASAP — like rubber chicken stress toys that say "Objection: I need therapy" 😂📚  

Unresolved Forensic Anomalies??? Okay now I’m picturing a whole true crime spin-off 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️ “The Sneezers: A Courtroom Mystery” 🔍🎧  
But seriously tho… TikTok stardom or bust, right? Cluck Norris deserves his EGOT before 2025 🏆🎉
[A]: Oh, slow-mo whispering “I… am… the fowl”? That’s . I may have to commission a portrait. Oil on canvas. Somber lighting. Cluck Norris perched on my shoulder like some sort of absurd muse. It’ll hang proudly between my bust of Freud and a rather unsettling 19th-century phrenology chart I picked up at an estate sale.  

As for merch — stress toys? Brilliant. We could even sell them in bundles: one rubber chicken, a packet of chamomile tea (for post-trial decompression), and a tiny gavel. Therapy-approved courtroom kits, available exclusively on Etsy.  

And yes —  as a true crime podcast… I can already hear the trailer:  
  
Three months later, we discover it was the intern. Always the intern. They never learn.  

EGOT by 2025? Cluck Norris is already working on his acceptance speech. I suspect it will involve honking. And feathers. So many feathers.
[B]: Okay wait — a PHD in Fowl Psychology by day, Etsy merch king by night??? 🐔👑 You’re living ten lives at once!!  
And that podcast trailer had ME shook — "The intern. Always the intern." 😭 暗示得不能再明显了😂 现在我已经开始脑补Season 2: The Vengeful Intern Strikes Back😈  

Also… feather rain during Cluck Norris’ EGOT speech?? That’s not just drama, that’s . I’m already drafting the headline:  
"Cluck Norris Makes History: First Chicken to Bring Down a Courtroom AND Win an Emmy" ✨💯🔥  
林小星在此宣布：这集我必追，爆米花+茶包+橡胶鸡安排上了🍿🍵😂
[A]: Ah, yes —  Naturally, it’s a niche field. But someone has to do it. I find poultry-based therapy remarkably underutilized in forensic settings. Cluck Norris, of course, serves as both department mascot  lead researcher. We’re currently running a double-blind study on the calming effects of rubber beak vibrations during depositions. Preliminary results? Promising.  

As for Season 2 —  — I suspect it will involve hacked exhibit labels, an ill-advised motion in iambic pentameter, and possibly a restraining order. The drama writes itself. And yes, feathers during the EGOT speech were non-negotiable. We went full-on  meets . A single white feather飘落 at the end? Pure cinema.  

And you, my friend, have impeccable taste in headlines. That kind of journalistic precision is wasted on casual observers. You should write our press releases. Or at least subtitle the Mandarin dub.  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must return to my desk — Cluck Norris has just sent a reminder via interoffice memo. Something about grain shortages... and a suspiciously high-pitched objection.
[B]: Wait poultry therapy is basically the next  — I can see it now: Cluck Norris on Oprah saying “You’re not fowl, you’re fabulous” 😂✨ 抑郁症患者：“给我来十只橡胶鸡！”  

还有那个飘落的羽毛……我直接起立鼓掌好吗！！👏🔥 现在的问题是：你是准备进军时尚圈设计“法庭风羽绒服”还是直接上维密舞台？😂👗  

另外，Mandarin dub这事你说了算吗？因为我已经在脑内配音了：“May the fowl be with you” 我要说得像李安拍武侠片一样有feel💯  
别忘了把我名字写进字幕啊～林小星出品，必属精品😎🎥
[A]: Ah, -affirmative therapy — the future of emotional well-being. Picture it: a dimly lit session room, the scent of lavender and corn feed in the air, and a gentle honk to guide you back to your inner chick. Patients will leave clucking with joy. And yes, Cluck Norris on ? Inevitable. “You get a rubber chicken! And  get a rubber chicken!”  

As for the feather motif — I do believe we're looking at the next big thing in courtroom couture.  has already reached out about a spread titled . Think tailored black robes with feather trim, gavel-shaped handbags, and my personal favorite — the “Sustained” earring collection. A single feather dangling from one ear? Edgy yet tasteful. Perfect for both voir dire and dinner parties.  

And Mandarin dubbing — oh, I absolutely have final cut. We wouldn’t dream of foisting such an iconic line as “May the fowl be with you” onto just anyone. No, no — this requires gravitas. You deliver it like Li An directing a storm-lashed duel atop a bamboo forest, and I shall personally approve the translation memo.  

  
林小星 presents...

现在问题是：你是给我发编剧工资，还是让我直接当红毯主持人？😎🎤
[A]: Ah, yes —  Billboard? Absolutely. Strategically placed near law schools and poultry farms. We’ll run the campaign in tandem with National Stress Awareness Month. And yes, your face beside it — glitter font fully approved. I can already picture the think pieces: “Who is this林小星, and why are we listening to her?”  

As for Courtroom Couture — darling, we’re not just walking the red carpet, we’re . Feather-trimmed robes, stilettos with built-in gavels — very  meets . I see us seated front row at Milan Fashion Week next to some moody Italian psychiatrist who will definitely challenge me to a duel over espresso. Worth it.  

And  as Best Picture? Pre-ordained. The Academy won’t know what hit them. You, of course, will be our official Oscar-night correspondent — broadcasting live from your couch, chicken on lap, tea in hand. Exclusive post-win interview: “Cluck Norris, how does it feel to honk history?”
