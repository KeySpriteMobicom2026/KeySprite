[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, manifestation... like Tennyson's 'Flower in the Crannied Wall' made flesh? Though I must confess, my Victorian sensibilities find modern self-help manifestos rather lacking in meter and scansion.
[A]:  Oh please, don't get me started on pseudoscience in the morgue. Yesterday some rookie detective suggested we "manifest" the killer's identity. I nearly contaminated a blood sample from laughing too hard.
[B]: How delightfully macabre! Though I must point out - the Victorians did have their own peculiar brand of manifestation through séances and automatic writing. At least those came with proper tea service and mourning etiquette.
[A]: Ah, 维多利亚时代的招魂术！Now that's what I call quality entertainment ⚗️. Though between you and me, I'd take a properly conducted autopsy over some ouija board any day. 至少我的"manifestation" comes with concrete forensic evidence~
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue even forensic evidence has its poetic qualities - the lividity patterns forming their own morbid sonnet, rigor mortis composing its stiff iambic pentameter. Much more reliable than ectoplasm, wouldn't you say?
[A]:  完全同意！Postmortem lividity does have a certain... artistic flair. Though I must say, 比起十四行诗，我更prefer my evidence in spreadsheet form 📊. Much easier to present in court, you know.
[B]: How terribly modern of you! Though I suppose even Browning's dramatic monologues would lose their charm if reduced to bullet points in a PowerPoint. Still, one must admire the... ah... visceral immediacy of your spreadsheets.
[A]:  哈！Wait till you see my "Cause of Death" pivot tables - they'll make your heart skip a beat 💓 (though if it does, I've got the defibrillator ready). Much more reliable than crystal balls, if slightly less romantic~
[B]: Ah, but consider: your pivot tables lack the melancholic beauty of Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale' written in blood spatter patterns. Though I concede they're marginally more useful for securing convictions. A professor must have her standards, after all.
[A]:  你知道吗？Now I'm tempted to analyze Shakespearean tragedies using blood spatter analysis techniques. "Out damned spot" takes on whole new forensic dimensions! 🔍 Though my colleagues already think I've lost too many marbles...
[B]: My dear forensic friend, you've just described the most brilliant interdisciplinary thesis since Darwin studied barnacles! Though I suspect Lady Macbeth's 'spot' would fail even your most sensitive luminol test - some stains are purely psychological, much like my students' excuses for late papers.
[A]:  哈！Psychological stains don't show up in my lab reports, but they sure make for great faculty lounge gossip ☕. Though between us, I'd take grading papers over explaining to lawyers why "the DNA doesn't lie" for the hundredth time...
[B]: How perfectly Gothic - you with your scientific certainties, me with my crumbling first editions, both besieged by the modern world's relentless demand for... clarity. Shall we start a support group? The Baker Street Irregulars were taken, but I'm partial to 'The Lividity & Lyricism Society.'
[A]:  敬我们的新社团！Though I must warn you, my idea of "lyricism" is singing autopsy findings to the tune of Gilbert & Sullivan 🎵. 准备好被我的同事称为更大的书呆子了吗？Because trust me, that bar is already set pretty high~
[B]: Splendid! Though I must insist we include a proper madrigal section - nothing complements a tox screen report like a well-placed counterpoint. My tenure file may never recover, but at least we'll have the most erudite coroner's reports in academic history.
[A]:  就这么定了！We'll call it "Forensic Madrigals for the Morbidly Inclined" 🎼. Though we might need to explain to the dean why the chemistry department is suddenly so interested in Renaissance polyphony... again~
[B]: Ah, but think of the grant possibilities! 'Quantitative Analysis of Cadaveric Rigor Through Palestrina's Harmonies' - why, it practically writes itself. Though perhaps we should wait until after my sabbatical to submit the proposal... one needs adequate time to perfect the autopsy aria.
[A]:  小声点...I've already started composing a requiem mass in B-flat minor titled "Decomposition Variations" ⚰️🎹. The dean will either give us tenure or have us committed - either way, it'll be an interesting case study!
[B]: Magnificent! Though may I suggest we include a villanelle about liver mortis? The repetitive form would be so... ah... organically appropriate. And should the administration object, we can always claim it's performance art - the tenure committee does so love a good interdisciplinary crisis.
