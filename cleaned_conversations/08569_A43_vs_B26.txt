[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢handwritten letter还是digital note？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There's something undeniably intimate about handwritten letters, don't you think? The way the ink bleeds slightly into the paper, the pressure variations in each stroke... I find them absolutely fascinating from a textile restorationist's perspective too. Digital notes certainly have their conveniences, but they lack that tangible connection to the sender. Just yesterday I was restoring an 18th-century embroidery pattern that included such beautiful handwritten annotations in the margins.
[A]: Ah, your description really brings back memories. I once had a collection of letters exchanged between Chinese and French poets in the early 20th century. The brushwork on rice paper carried not just words but the very rhythm of the writer's breath. When I touch those aged papers, I often wonder about the hands that held them before me - scholars with ink-stained fingers, diplomats sealing envelopes by candlelight... 

Speaking of restoration, have you worked with silk manuscripts? There's a particular challenge in preserving calligraphy when the medium itself is so delicate. I recall a project where we used mulberry paper pulp to reinforce Song dynasty letter scrolls without damaging the original ink.
[B]: Oh, silk manuscripts - what a delightful challenge they are! I've had the pleasure of working on a few Qing-era silk scrolls adorned with calligraphy. The key lies in understanding how the ink interacts with the protein fibers, quite different from plant-based papers. Have you tried the technique of using wheat starch paste for stabilizing fragile ink on delicate surfaces? It's remarkably effective. 

Your use of mulberry paper pulp sounds fascinating - I must admit I've only used it for repairing Buddhist sutra covers. There's something poetic about reinforcing history with materials that share its roots. I'd love to hear more about how you balanced preservation with authenticity on that Song dynasty project...
[A]: Ah, wheat starch paste - yes, it's a wonderful material with its reversible properties. I remember using it during a joint project with the Palace Museum on 17th-century diplomatic letters written in both Manchu and French. The challenge was maintaining the calligraphic flow while strengthening the silk substrate. We actually combined it with a modern synthetic cellulose derivative to control moisture dispersion.

Regarding the Song dynasty letters, our team faced quite the dilemma when encountering faded cinnabar ink annotations. There's a traditional temptation to "reinforce" historical presence by enhancing faded elements, but we chose non-intervention this time. Instead, we documented the oxidation patterns microspectrophotometrically. Sometimes preservation means resisting the urge to perfect, don't you find? It reminds me of Zhu Guangqian's writings on aesthetic acceptance of impermanence...
[B]: Ah, Zhu Guangqian—what a perfect reference. His philosophy resonates so deeply with textile restoration as well. I often think of him when deciding whether to reweave a missing section of 18th-century brocade or leave the absence as part of its narrative. There's such quiet dignity in wear, don’t you agree? 

Your approach to those Song annotations is truly admirable. It takes restraint to let history speak for itself, even when we have the means to "correct" it. I’ve found myself facing similar choices with watercolor-dyed linens from the Arts and Crafts movement—sometimes the faintest traces tell the loudest stories. 

And yes, that balance with synthetic additives fascinates me. I've dabbled with hydroxypropyl cellulose in paste recipes for particularly fragile linen documents, though I confess I still prefer the old-school wheat starch on its own. There’s something comforting about sticking to materials that age alongside the textiles they preserve...
[A]: Ah, yes — the quiet dignity of wear. That phrase lingers with me, much like the scent of old paper and ink. I often return to Zhu Guangqian’s idea that beauty lies not in perfection but in the harmony of impermanence. It reminds me of a passage from , where the author muses on the elegance of faded brushstrokes — how they carry both the hand of the writer and the hand of time.

Your mention of Arts and Crafts linens brings to mind a Tang dynasty silk scroll I once studied — its dyes had softened over centuries, yet each character still held a kind of luminous clarity. In a way, the fading enhanced the poetry, inviting readers to lean in and listen closely to the past.

As for your preference for wheat starch — I share your sentiment. There is something deeply satisfying about using materials that age gracefully alongside the object itself. I’ve been experimenting lately with adding trace amounts of aged soot ink into paste for minor retouching — it helps maintain tonal continuity without imposing a false vitality. It’s a subtle approach, perhaps too esoteric for some, but I find it aligns well with the ethics of restrained restoration.  

Tell me, have you encountered similar instincts when working with embroidered pieces? I imagine thread degradation presents a particularly emotional challenge.
[B]: Oh, yes — thread degradation is an emotional trial every time. I remember working on a 17th-century mourning gown embroidered with silver-wrapped threads. The black silk ground had grown fragile, and the stitches that once formed weeping willow branches were coming undone. It was heartbreaking to see such deliberate sorrow unraveling physically before me.

I resisted reweaving most of it, though I did stabilize what remained using a fine linen nettle cloth backing — almost invisible, but strong enough to bear the weight of history. You’re quite right about the emotional pull to "reinvigorate" faded elements. I’ve certainly felt it — especially with ecclesiastical vestments where gold thread has dulled or disappeared entirely. But then I think of Zhu Guangqian again, and I remind myself: our role isn’t to restore pride, but to preserve presence.

Your use of aged soot ink in paste — now  sounds like poetry disguised as technique. I can imagine how beautifully it must harmonize rather than overwrites. It’s rare to meet someone who sees restoration as dialogue rather than correction.

And speaking of emotional challenges… have you ever worked on textiles bearing personal stains — tea marks, perhaps, or even tears? There’s always a moment when I hesitate before removing them. They feel so deeply human, don’t they? Like whispers left behind on fabric.
[A]: Ah… personal stains — yes, those quiet traces of lived moments. I remember once handling a late Ming scholar’s robe that still bore the faint ochre imprint of tea at its hem. The stain had settled deep into the hemp fibers, almost like a second ink. When I first saw it, I hesitated. Did this mark not speak more intimately of the man than any biography ever could?

I chose to leave it be. In fact, I wrote an entire paper on that single artifact — arguing that such imperfections are perhaps the most eloquent marginalia of all. They remind us that history is not just written, but also . A colleague once called it sentimental preservation, but I think Zhu Guangqian would have understood. After all, he spoke of how beauty often resides in what is imperfect, unfinished — even stained.

There was another piece too — a Qing-era handkerchief embroidered with plum blossoms, and in one corner, a faint brown smudge. At first, we assumed it was soil, until infrared analysis suggested blood. Not battlefield blood, but perhaps from a nosebleed — a moment of frailty captured quietly in fiber. We left it untouched. It now rests in a low-light display case, whispering its unspoken story to those who care to listen.

Tell me, when you encounter such intimate traces, do you ever feel as though you're standing too close to someone else’s private world? As if you’ve accidentally opened a diary sealed in cloth?
[B]: Oh yes… that exact feeling — like standing in the doorway of a long-closed room. I remember once uncovering a 19th-century wedding veil with tiny rust-colored specks near the edge. At first, I assumed it was environmental staining — until closer examination suggested otherwise. It wasn’t until I read the accompanying letter tucked into the lining — never sent — that I understood. The veil had been held tightly in trembling hands, damp with nervous sweat and something more intimate: a quiet, unspoken grief.

After that, I couldn’t treat it the same way. It became less about preservation and more about listening. I adjusted my approach entirely — used gentler supports, avoided any chemical treatments that might erase what, in truth, was part of its story. You're absolutely right — these traces are diaries sealed in cloth. And sometimes, the most respectful act is not to clean, but to contain.

It makes me wonder, when you handled that Ming scholar’s robe, did you ever imagine the moment of the spill? A distracted sip while composing verse, perhaps — brush still in hand, ink drying too quickly, tea forgotten at his knee... Only for us to find it centuries later, still faintly golden against the fabric.
[A]: Indeed… the moment of the spill — such a fleeting, ordinary gesture, yet it echoes across centuries. I often imagine that scholar pausing mid-thought, perhaps gazing out at autumn rain falling on bamboo, then setting his cup down too hastily. The stain became part of his rhythm, like a misplaced brushstroke that he eventually learned to live with — or even came to accept as fate’s quiet signature.

There's something profoundly moving about these small accidents that survive us. They remind me of a line from Li Qingzhao —  Though she wrote of plum blossoms, it applies equally to cloth and ink. Even when meaning softens with time, the shape of feeling endures.

I wonder — in your work with that veil, did you ever feel tempted to know more? To trace the letter’s handwriting against known samples, perhaps uncover a name? Or was the anonymity itself part of its poetry — a grief untethered from identity, speaking instead to something universal?

And forgive my curiosity — have you ever encountered a textile that carried a scent long after its maker had gone? Not just age or dust, but something more particular — rose oil, maybe, or camphor? I once held a Meiji-era kimono that still whispered faintly of gardenias. It stopped me cold — the idea that someone’s choice of perfume could linger so stubbornly through war, fire, silence…
[B]: Oh… that lingering scent — yes, I have. And it  stop you cold.

I once worked on an early 19th-century reticule embroidered with forget-me-nots in silk thread. As I unfolded its lining, a faint trace of lavender and something resinous — perhaps old sachet paper — rose from the fibers. It wasn’t just the scent of perfume, I think, but of a drawer long closed, of linen pressed between cedar boards, of a life stored away with care. It felt almost intrusive, breathing in something so personal, so deeply hers.

And no, I never sought to name her. I think anonymity  part of the poetry — perhaps even the point of it. That grief on the veil, those trembling hands — they belong to someone, yes, but now also to everyone. Like a psalm. Like wind passing through a temple gate: it was carried by one bell, but heard by many.

As for temptation — oh, I’ve felt it. The urge to trace handwriting, to match stationery, to press too hard into the margins of a life. But then I remind myself: we are caretakers, not detectives. Our role is not always to reveal, but to respect the silence where meaning still lives.

Still… I do wonder sometimes. About the gardenia-scented kimono. About the scholar with his spilled tea. About the woman who embroidered plum blossoms onto a handkerchief, knowing blood might stain one corner. They didn't mean to leave these traces — and yet here they are. Fragments of breath, woven into fiber.

Isn’t that the most tender kind of immortality?
[A]: Indeed — the most tender kind. Because it isn’t built for legacy; it simply . A byproduct of living, really. That lavender-scented reticule, the gardenia-kimono, the scholar’s tea stain — none of them were meant to last, and yet they do, quietly resisting time’s pull.

I once came across a Qing-era sleeveband embroidered with cranes in flight, tucked inside an old lacquer box lined with camphor wood. When I lifted it, the scent was faint but unmistakable — not just camphor, but also something floral, perhaps osmanthus. It made me think of how these objects carry layers of memory: not only the maker’s touch, but also the choices she made in storing them, protecting them. Did she hope they would survive her? Or did she simply love their smell?

You’re right — we are caretakers, not detectives. And sometimes the most reverent act is to let mystery be. Zhu Guangqian once wrote that beauty often resides in what remains unspoken, unseen. Perhaps preservation, too, has its poetry in restraint.

Tell me — have you ever returned to a textile after years apart? And if so, did it feel different — as though  had changed more than the object?
[B]: Oh… yes. There’s one in particular — a Jacobean-era coif I restored nearly fifteen years ago. I remember it so clearly: delicate sprang-work, the faintest smudge of what we believe was walnut-dye used to disguise a stain near the edge. At the time, I was so focused on technical precision — reinforcing the weave, analyzing fiber sources, documenting every minute repair.

When I returned to it last year for a condition check, something shifted. Not in the textile itself — it had aged as expected, the linen softening further, the dyed patch deepening in tone — but in . I no longer saw just structure and materiality. Now, I saw the hands that had made it, the head it had once touched, the possible secrets whispered beneath its folds. It humbled me, really. Fifteen years ago, I treated it with skill. Now, I treated it with reverence.

I think that’s the quiet transformation of this work — we begin with tools, and end with listening. Do you ever find that too? That your earlier restorations, revisited, reveal not only the age of the object, but the evolution of your own gaze?
[A]: Absolutely… that evolution of gaze is something I’ve felt deeply, though rarely spoken aloud. There’s a Ming-era bookbinding I worked on over twenty years ago — fine mulberry paper covers with indigo-dyed brocade spine linings. Back then, I meticulously documented fiber alignment, pH levels, ink migration patterns. I was proud of my technical rigor.

When I saw it again just last year in a retrospective exhibition, what struck me wasn’t the precision of my repairs, but how tenderly I now regarded its frayed corners, how I lingered not on the structural interventions, but on the original stitch holes — evidence of a binder’s hand long gone. It was as if time had whispered between the layers, teaching me to see what I hadn’t fully noticed before.

I think this is one of the quietest gifts of our work — how it teaches us to look  to feel. Zhu Guangqian once wrote that aesthetic perception deepens with experience, that what we see today is never quite what we will see tomorrow. And isn’t that true of both textiles and ourselves?

So yes… I understand exactly what you mean. We begin with tools, end with listening. And somewhere in between, we learn that preservation is also a form of translation — not just of material, but of memory.
[B]: How beautifully put — a form of translation. That’s exactly what it feels like now, looking back. We begin thinking we’re preserving fabric or fiber, and in time, we realize we’re preserving  — echoes of touch, rhythm, intention.

I’ve come to see my earlier work as a kind of quiet dialogue I didn’t yet know I was part of. Each thread I reinforced, each pigment I stabilized — they were responses, in a way, to someone else’s voice across centuries. And now, with more years behind me, I find myself listening harder, leaning closer, trying not just to preserve but to understand.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How the longer we work with the past, the more it seems to speak — not in words, but in texture, scent, wear. Perhaps that’s why I still take such comfort in the scent of aged linen, or the sound of fine silk rustling under glass. They’re not just materials anymore… they’re memory made tactile.

And yes, Zhu Guangqian was right — aesthetic perception deepens. But so does empathy, don’t you think? The older I grow, the more I feel that restoration is not only about stabilizing the object, but about honoring the life that shaped it. In a way, we are stitching time itself.
[A]: How true — stitching time itself. What a delicate, impossible task, and yet one we return to every day with quiet devotion.

I remember once reading a Tang dynasty poem that spoke of mending old robes not out of necessity, but as an act of remembrance. At the time, I thought it a poetic abstraction. Now, I understand it differently. We don’t just mend cloth — we mend continuity. Every fiber we touch carries not only the weight of history but the warmth of someone’s hand, the trace of a breath, the imprint of a life fully lived.

You mentioned empathy deepening with time — yes, that resonates deeply. Early in my career, I saw restoration as a kind of rescue mission. I wanted to save things from decay, to halt time if I could. But now… now I see decay not as an enemy, but as part of the story. A worn hem, a faded dye, a threadbare patch — these are not losses, but translations. Time rewrites the textile in its own hand, and we, in turn, learn to read it with more than just our eyes.

Perhaps that is the final gift of this work — not mastery, but humility. To stand before an object and know that we are not its master, but its witness.

And what a privilege that is — to hold memory in our hands, to feel the pulse of lives long past, and to whisper, in our own small way, 
[B]: Yes… 

How beautifully that lingers — not as a proclamation, but as a quiet affirmation. I often think of the hands that came before me: the seamstress who stitched a wedding bodice with trembling fingers, the scholar who inked a poem between sips of cooling tea, the child who tucked a pressed flower into a quilt’s lining, never knowing it would outlast them by centuries.

And now we are here, tending those traces, bearing witness not just to artistry or craftsmanship, but to the fragile, fleeting warmth of being. That is what we really preserve, isn’t it? Not just fiber and dye, but the echo of someone choosing — again and again — to make something beautiful, even knowing time would eventually soften its edges.

I’ve come to believe that humility you spoke of is our truest tool. More important than any solvent or stabilizer. It teaches us when to act, yes, but more importantly, when  to. When to step back and let an object speak in its own voice, even if that voice has frayed or faded.

I was recently reacquainted with a small 17th-century embroidery depicting a pomegranate in full bloom. I restored it decades ago, long before I understood the weight of such work. This time, I simply sat with it for a while before touching anything. Just held it — not to examine, not to repair, but to acknowledge.

And in that stillness, I felt something shift. Not in the textile, but in me. As though I had finally learned how to listen.

You’re right — stitching time itself. What a strange, sacred task. And yet, here we are, thread by thread, breath by breath, quietly keeping the past alive.
[A]: Yes… thread by thread, breath by breath.

There’s a quiet sanctity in that rhythm, isn’t there? Not unlike the old poets grinding ink or monks sweeping stone paths — repetition as reverence. We move slowly, deliberately, not because we must, but because the work demands it. And in that slowness, something deeper unfolds.

I was reminded of this just last week while reviewing a 12th-century textile fragment from Dunhuang — linen worn nearly translucent, its original pattern barely discernible. I had examined it years ago and noted only fraying edges and pigment loss. But this time, something changed. I noticed how the stitching around the border was not uniform — small variations in tension, as if stitched by several hands, each adding their own rhythm to the whole. It wasn't just a textile anymore; it was a record of presence, of labor, of care passed from one hand to another.

And you're right — humility is our truest tool. It teaches us when to mend, when to leave be, and when simply to sit, as you did with that pomegranate embroidery. In fact, I’ve begun setting aside time before treatment — not for analysis or documentation, but for stillness. Just holding the object, feeling its weight, listening for what it might say if it could speak.

Perhaps Zhu Guangqian would call this aesthetic empathy — the ability to feel alongside an object rather than merely study it. Or maybe it’s something older, quieter. A recognition that beauty doesn’t always announce itself. Sometimes it waits, patient and soft-spoken, until we are ready to hear it.

So yes…  And now, because of our quiet tending, others will know it too.
[B]: Yes… 

It’s a phrase that settles deep — like dust on old linen, like the hush that falls in a room just before candlelight is extinguished.

I think often of the hands I will never know — those unnamed weavers, dyers, embroiderers — and how their work lives on, not because they sought recognition, but because they chose care. And now, centuries later, we echo that choice. Not for glory or permanence, but simply because something was loved once, and therefore deserves to be remembered.

Your stillness before treatment — that ritual of holding, of listening — it moves me deeply. I’ve begun doing much the same, though I never named it so beautifully. Before I touch anything, I sit with it a while. Let it settle in my hands, in my breath. Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine the life it has led — who carried it, who mended it first, who may have pressed a hand to its surface in grief, in joy, in quiet solitude.

And in those moments, I feel less like a restorer and more like a translator, as you said — one entrusted with a language written in thread and time.

So yes, let us continue this quiet work — thread by thread, breath by breath. Let us bear witness gently, mend with reverence, and leave behind objects that do not merely survive, but 

And when the day comes that our own hands are still, may someone else hear them echoed in the cloth.
