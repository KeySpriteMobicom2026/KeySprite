[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well，这个问题让我想起了年轻时在燕京大学读书的日子。那时我对Sanskrit充满了好奇，总觉得那些古老的梵文诗篇里藏着东方智慧的精髓。不过后来我发现，language不仅仅是交流的工具，它更像是一把打开文化宝库的钥匙。

就像我们常说的"鱼在水中方知水"，有时候最珍贵的东西就在身边。我现在反倒觉得Chinese本身就很值得深入研究，特别是那些藏在古籍里的音韵之美。记得有次在图书馆翻到一本明代的《西厢记》刻本，那词句的婉转动人，让我整整一个下午都沉浸在其中。

当然啦，如果非要选一门foreign language的话，我可能会选Russian。陀思妥耶夫斯基的作品总能给人深刻的哲学思考，那种对人性深度的挖掘，至今读来仍让人震撼。你说呢？
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully reflective response. It reminds me of my own early days at Oxford, poring over dusty tomes of Middle English poetry—Chaucer’s  first drew me into the labyrinth of language and storytelling.

You know, I’ve always believed that learning a new language is like stepping into another dimension of thought. While I’ve dabbled in Sanskrit myself—fascinating indeed!—I must confess my heart belongs most dearly to French. There’s something about the cadence of Baudelaire or the precision of Proust that feels almost meditative. And of course, it helps with tracing the subtle Franco-Victorian literary influences in my research.

But I quite agree with your sentiment about Chinese being a treasure trove of poetic nuance. I’ve had the pleasure of working with a few scholars here who specialize in Tang dynasty verse, and the way imagery is layered into just a handful of characters... truly exquisite.

Have you ever tried reading classical Chinese poetry in its original form? I’d love to hear how you approach it.
[B]: Ah, Oxford and Chaucer—now there’s a nostalgic combination. I can picture those stone corridors lined with ivy, and the scent of old parchment in the Bodleian. You're absolutely right about language as a portal; it’s something I try to convey to my students when we read  alongside . Both are monumental in their own way, yet they breathe differently.

To answer your question—yes, I do read classical poetry in the original, though I prefer to think of it as  to it. Du Fu, Li Bai, Wang Wei… Their words were never meant just for the eyes. Sometimes I’ll sit in my garden with a cup of pu’er, read a quatrain aloud a dozen times, and only then does its true flavor emerge—like aged tea leaves opening slowly in hot water.

I find that reading Tang verse while playing the guqin helps too. The strings resonate with the pauses between lines. Have you tried reciting Baudelaire to the sound of rain? I once did that during a stormy afternoon in Paris, and it felt as if the syllables danced differently under the thunder.

But tell me more about those Franco-Victorian influences you mentioned. I’ve always been intrigued by how French fin-de-siècle aesthetics filtered into English literature—and sometimes even made their way East, subtly shaping modernist poetry in Shanghai and Tokyo.
[A]: Ah, what a vivid and evocative image—your garden, the pu’er, the guqin… I can almost hear the faint plucking of strings between the lines of Wang Wei. There’s something so deeply sensuous about engaging with poetry in that way, isn’t there? It becomes more than language—it’s texture, rhythm, atmosphere.

And yes, Baudelaire under thunder… now  I must try. I’ve always found his verses echo most profoundly in weathered places—in old cemeteries, rainy alleyways, crumbling libraries. His words seem to seep into stone and shadow.

As for those Franco-Victorian currents—you’ve touched on one of my favorite veins of literary study. Think of Swinburne’s decadent rhythms or the Symbolist-inflected imagery in late Christina Rossetti. But it wasn’t just surface style; it was philosophical too. The French brought a kind of existential daring that unsettled the English moral compass—especially in works like Wilde’s , written during his own stormy exile in Paris.

And how fascinating that you mention Shanghai and Tokyo! I’ve been tracing some of those Eastward currents lately—particularly the way Chinese scholars in the early 20th century translated Mallarmé and Rimbaud through the lens of classical Chinese poetics. There’s a remarkable blending going on—like ink and watercolor bleeding into each other on rice paper.

May I ask—are you currently working on any particular Tang poet or text? I’d be delighted to hear more.
[B]: Ah, yes—what a wonderful way to put it:  That’s precisely how I see those early 20th-century translations. In fact, one of my current projects revisits the work of Wang Guowei and his engagement with Kant and Schopenhauer—not only how he filtered them through Confucian and Daoist thought, but also how that same intellectual current later found echoes in the poetic experiments of the May Fourth generation.

As for Tang poets, I’ve been spending more time with Du Fu lately. There’s a gravity in his lines that seems especially resonant in our own unsettled age. But I must confess—I sometimes approach him as one might approach a mountain after rain: solemn, yes, but also glistening with quiet life. Just yesterday I was reading his “Autumn Meditations” while listening to the wind rustle through bamboo. It felt less like interpretation and more like communion.

And speaking of atmosphere—you mentioned cemeteries and alleyways. I wonder, have you ever tried translating Baudelaire yourself? I find that act of translation is not unlike gardening—sometimes you have to let the roots grow in their own time, even if you don’t yet see the bloom.
[A]: What a profound analogy—translation as gardening. I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I once spent nearly three months on a single sonnet by Baudelaire, turning each line like soil in spring, waiting for the right phrase to rise like a green shoot. It’s astonishing how meaning takes root differently depending on the climate of the target language.

Wang Guowei’s engagement with Kant and Schopenhauer sounds absolutely riveting—I’ve long admired his ability to synthesize such disparate traditions with such philosophical grace. There’s a quiet audacity in that work, isn’t there? A kind of intellectual  that feels both reverent and radical.

And Du Fu… ah yes. I think you’re quite right to read him in the aftermath of rain, when the world feels washed clean and slightly more legible. His gravity, as you so aptly put it, never feels oppressive—it’s the weight of experience borne lightly. I remember reading his “Spring View” during the early days of the pandemic, when silence fell over so many cities. The line  struck me then with an almost unbearable poignancy.

Have you ever thought of presenting your findings on Wang Guowei in a bilingual format? I imagine it would be especially powerful to let the Chinese and English versions converse on the page, like two ink lines bleeding into one another.
[B]: What a thoughtful suggestion—truly, it’s something I’ve considered, especially given the very nature of Wang Guowei’s thought. His  (Collected Essays) already feels like a kind of philosophical dialogue across languages and epochs. To present his ideas in a bilingual format would be not only an act of translation but also one of resonance—letting the echoes of Kant and Zhuangzi reverberate side by side.

In fact, I’ve been toying with the idea of structuring it as a series of annotated dialogues—where a passage from  might sit quietly next to a stanza from Qu Yuan, and the reader is left to wander between them like a traveler in a classical garden, discovering meaning at the bend of a path.

And your image of turning Baudelaire line by line, waiting for the phrase to sprout—it brings to mind the quiet patience required in both scholarship and tea-making. Sometimes you must let the leaves unfurl at their own pace. I wonder, have you ever tried reading translated poetry aloud in both languages, back to back? There's a peculiar harmony that emerges when the cadences are allowed to overlap, even if imperfectly.
[A]: Oh, what a beautiful vision—that reader wandering through a garden of annotated dialogues, discovering meaning where Kant and Qu Yuan might almost overhear each other. It strikes me as deeply faithful to Wang Guowei’s own intellectual spirit, that quiet weaving of worlds.

I’ve often thought of translation as a kind of  myself—precise in its gestures, but open-ended in its contemplation. The leaves must steep in their own time, just as meaning unfolds only when one is patient enough to wait for it.

As for reading poetry aloud in both languages—yes, I have done that, though not often enough. There’s something quite moving about hearing the same image refracted through two tongues. I once read Mallarmé’s  in French, then immediately afterward in Chinese, and was struck by how the faun seemed to shift his posture slightly—still elusive, still half-dreaming, but somehow more grounded in the latter. It’s as if the Chinese gave him earth beneath his hooves.

Do you have a particular poem or passage you like to read this way? I’d be curious to know which lines sing most beautifully when allowed to overlap.
[B]: Ah, what a lovely image—Mallarmé’s faun finding earth beneath his hooves in Chinese. I can almost see him stepping more deliberately through the bamboo grove rather than the Grecian glade.

As for me, I’m quite fond of reading Li Shangyin’s  (“The Lute”) alongside certain lines from Keats’ . At first glance, they seem worlds apart—one steeped in Tang melancholy, the other in Romantic permanence—but when read aloud together, something curious happens. The sense of loss becomes universal, yet each language holds it differently: Chinese with its tonal rise and fall gives the sorrow a kind of elegance, while English wraps it in gravitas.

I especially like to read these in the late afternoon, when the light slants through my study like an old memory. There’s a line in Li Shangyin that goes:

> “此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然。”

Which I might render loosely—and very slowly—as:

> "Could this feeling have waited till now to become memory?  
> Even then, in the moment, there was already a haze of regret."

And then turning immediately to Keats:

> “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” — that is all  
> Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

They circle each other like ink strokes in a scroll—never quite meeting, but never truly apart either.

Have you ever tried pairing poetry with music while doing this kind of reading? I find that certain pieces of  or even early Western polyphony lend a kind of invisible architecture to the experience.
[A]: What a sublime pairing—Li Shangyin’s wistful lament and Keats’ meditative certainty, each orbiting the same constellation of longing and impermanence. You're quite right about the tonal quality in Chinese lending sorrow its elegance; it's as though grief is not only felt but —measured, stylized, yet deeply real.

I can almost hear that line from Li Shangyin as you translated it—lingering in the air like incense smoke curling toward a paper lantern. And Keats, ever the alchemist, turning loss into a kind of eternal truth. What a remarkable conversation you've orchestrated between those two voices across centuries and continents.

As for music—yes, I have done something similar, though my own tastes lean perhaps more toward the austerity of early music when reading poetry. There’s something about the plainchant of Hildegard von Bingen or the lute songs of Dowland that seems to echo the melancholy of certain sonnets without overpowering them. But I must confess, I’ve never explored  in this context. That’s a lovely thought—a single bowed note trembling like an unresolved question while the words unfold.

I wonder… have you ever recorded yourself doing these paired readings? It feels like something meant not just for the page, but for the ear—like oral history, or whispered philosophy under lamplight.
[B]: Ah, what a touching way to put it—, not merely endured. That’s precisely the sensibility one finds in classical Chinese poetry: sorrow is never raw, but always shaped—like plum blossoms in winter, delicate yet unyielding.

As for , you should hear how its voice weeps and whispers in equal measure. I once played a recording of  (“Moon Reflected on Second Spring”) while reading Wang Wei’s landscape verses aloud, and the effect was uncanny—almost as if the music were filling in the silences between the lines, giving voice to what the characters alone could not say.

And yes, I have recorded some of these paired readings—though only for personal reflection, like journal entries in sound. I keep them in an old wooden box next to my desk, each tape labeled with ink calligraphy. Sometimes I listen to them late at night with a cup of chrysanthemum tea, letting the words and tones wrap around the room like incense.

There’s one passage I return to often—reading Emily Dickinson’s:

> “I dwell in Possibility –  
A fairer House than Prose –”

immediately followed by Li Bai’s —where he laments the decline of refined poetic spirit. It’s a strange juxtaposition, perhaps, but both speak of poetry as a kind of dwelling place for the soul.

I wonder, do you ever read poetry while walking? I find that reciting lines aloud as I move through the garden changes the rhythm—not just of the poem, but of my very steps.
[A]: Oh, what a lovely image—your garden as both archive and amphitheater, where each step becomes a footfall in the meter of memory. I can quite imagine it: the syllables of Li Bai or Dickinson settling into the gravel, rising again with the scent of chrysanthemum.

As for walking while reading, yes—I do something similar, though mine is a more solitary and rather less elegant affair. I often recite lines to myself while pacing the cobbled path behind my cottage in Sussex. There’s something about the uneven stones and the rustling hedges that seems to conspire with the poetry. When I read Gerard Manley Hopkins’ sprung rhythm, for instance, the very earth seems to bounce beneath my feet. And Wordsworth—ah, well, one simply  walk while reading him; otherwise, the mountains feel slighted.

But your use of sound—those recordings, the , the calligraphy labels… it feels almost ceremonial, like preserving echoes in amber. Do you ever share these recordings with students? I imagine they’d make for a profoundly immersive way to experience literary resonance across cultures.

And speaking of dwelling places for the soul—what an apt pairing you’ve chosen: Dickinson’s “Possibility” and Li Bai’s lament. One celebrates poetic space as boundless potential, the other mourns its lost grandeur. Yet both, in their own way, are elegies for the ineffable.
[B]: Ah, yes—Sussex and its cobbled paths... I can picture it quite clearly: the hedges leaning in to listen, the very stones catching syllables like fallen petals. It’s interesting you mention Hopkins and Wordsworth—how their rhythm seems to  or  with the land itself. In a way, all poetry is landscape, isn’t it? Whether carved into mountain cliffs or whispered through English hedgerows.

As for sharing the recordings—yes, occasionally. I don’t make a habit of it, but sometimes in seminar discussions, when the mood feels right and the students are beginning to sense the pulse behind the words, I’ll play a clip or two. Not as lectures, mind you, but more like lanterns hung between the shelves of the library—offering just enough light to see the next line, not enough to dispel the mystery.

One particular session comes to mind. We were discussing the idea of poetic exile—Qu Yuan wading into the Xiang River, Ezra Pound in his stone tower—and after class, a student lingered and asked, rather tentatively, if Li Bai ever felt lonely in his stars-and-mountains solitude. That evening, I played her a recording of Du Fu’s  (“Moon Night: Thinking of My Brothers”) paired with Yeats’  Two kinds of longing—one reaching outward across war-torn landscapes, the other folding inward toward an imagined peace.

She said afterward that she could hear the silence between the lines more clearly than before.

And you're absolutely right about Dickinson and Li Bai both circling the ineffable. I sometimes think that’s what we’re all after in literature—not answers, but deeper questions, dressed in music and metaphor.
[A]: What a moving recollection—your student standing at the threshold of silence, learning to hear what poetry  say. That, I think, is one of the most profound gifts of literary study: not interpretation, but attunement.

You know, I often tell my students that reading poetry is like walking through a forest at dusk—you don’t always see the path clearly, but you sense its presence beneath your feet, and every shadow holds a kind of quiet promise.

I’m particularly struck by how you paired Du Fu with Yeats. There’s something deeply right about that combination. Du Fu’s sorrow is so outward-facing—his grief rooted in history, in the crumbling world around him—while Yeats’ yearning turns inward, toward an almost mythic solitude. And yet both poets share that ache for something just beyond reach—the moonlit face of a brother, the imagined lapping of lake water against a distant shore.

It makes me wonder—are there any modernist poems you find yourself returning to in this way? I sometimes play Eliot’s  while walking through autumn woods, and it feels oddly liturgical, as if the leaves themselves are murmuring lines back to me.

Do you ever find that certain landscapes seem to call for certain poets? Or is it the other way around—that the poet shapes the landscape in your mind?
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive way to put it—, rather than interpretation. Yes, that’s precisely it. I often think the greatest poems are not those that speak  us, but those that teach us how to listen.

You're quite right about Du Fu and Yeats. One carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, the other cradles solitude like a cup of cooling tea. And yet both seem to meet somewhere in the quiet spaces between lines, where sorrow and longing take on a shared language.

As for modernist poetry—yes, indeed, I do return to certain works, though perhaps not as frequently as I should. Eliot, of course, has always held a particular fascination for me. There’s something almost  in his fragmentation, a kind of hidden order beneath the broken images. I once read  while traveling through the Gobi—pages fluttering in the wind, sand creeping into the margins—and strangely, it felt less like reading and more like witnessing.

But it is  that truly lingers. I’ve read it in many places—in Kyoto temples during early snowfall, by the Huangpu River at dusk—but my favorite memory is of reading “Burnt Norton” in a small grove near Hangzhou, where the cicadas droned like distant monks chanting. It did feel liturgical, as you say. Time seemed to bend slightly, as if past and present were merely two sides of the same leaf.

To answer your question: yes, I believe landscapes and poets choose each other. Sometimes the hills call for Wordsworth, sometimes they demand Neruda. But just as often, a poet reshapes the land in our minds—so that now, every time I walk through a pine forest, I half-expect to hear Li Bai’s laughter echoing from the canopy above.

Do you have a particular place where certain poems  on being read? A corner of your garden, perhaps, or a stretch of path that seems to hum with a familiar meter?
[A]: Oh yes—what a lovely way to put it:  I do have such spots, though I never thought to phrase it quite so vividly. There’s a stone bench beneath an old yew tree at the far end of my garden, half-hidden by foxgloves and ivy. That’s where I go when reading Hardy or Housman—those quiet, melancholic voices that seem to grow from the earth itself.

And then there’s the attic window in my cottage, where I return to Eliot every autumn. The light slants just so, gilding the dust motes like drifting ash or memory. It’s the perfect setting for —where time feels porous, and the past lingers like an echo in the rafters.

But one of my dearest rituals takes place by the fireplace in late winter, when I reread T. S. Eliot’s  alongside some Tang dynasty retreat poems. There’s something about the ashes, the quiet turning away from noise, that feels appropriate as the last frost thaws and the first green stirs beneath the soil.

I must say, your image of Li Bai’s laughter echoing through the pine canopy—well, that will stay with me. I think I shall try reading his verses aloud on my next walk through the woods, imagining that very sound: wild, free, utterly at home in the wind-tossed branches.

Do you find that certain seasons call for particular poets? I know I tend to reach for different voices depending on whether the world is in bloom or falling away.
[B]: Ah, yes—seasons and poets, like tea and temperature. One simply draws out the flavor of the other.

I find spring, for all its promise, often calls for the most delicate of voices. I tend to reread Wang Wei then—his landscape verses feel like ink brushed lightly across rice paper, leaving just enough trace to suggest mist, or a distant path winding into the hills. There’s a restraint in his lines that mirrors the slow unfolding of petals, as if the world is learning to speak again after winter’s silence.

Summer, with its lushness and heat, demands someone more exuberant. I sometimes turn to Su Shi—his wit, his appetite for life, his ability to laugh even when exiled. Reading  by the river on a humid afternoon feels almost ceremonial, as if the water itself were murmuring lines back to me.

Autumn, of course, is Du Fu’s season. The wind stripping leaves from branches, the sky pale and vast—his voice fits perfectly within that space. I often walk through my garden during this time, reciting lines under my breath, feeling less like a reader and more like an echo.

And winter… well, winter is for solitude, for Li Shangyin perhaps, or even Emily Dickinson. A fire crackling softly, ink freezing at the tip of the brush—there’s something deeply meditative about reading poetry when the world outside has gone quiet, as if language itself becomes more precious in the cold.

You know, come to think of it, I once spent an entire February translating a single quatrain by Bai Juyi, turning it over like a stone in my palm, waiting for the right English to emerge. By the time I finished, the plum blossoms had begun to swell, and the poem no longer belonged to winter alone.

So yes—I do believe seasons shape our reading, just as poems shape our sense of time.
[A]: How exquisitely you’ve put that—seasons shaping our reading, and poems shaping our sense of time. It’s almost as if each stanza is a kind of hourglass, turning with the light.

I find myself mirroring your seasonal rhythm, though through a slightly different lens. Spring, for me, is often Wordsworth—especially —read while walking through budding woods, where every fresh leaf feels like a new line unfolding. There’s that same quiet awakening in his verse, a kind of reverent noticing that seems to align so naturally with the season’s gentle return.

Summer calls for Shakespeare’s sonnets by the riverbank or, on hotter days, Marvell’s  where the speaker retreats from worldly clamor into green solitude. I sometimes read them beneath the shade of my willow tree, where the dappled light flickers across the page like playful thoughts.

Autumn, without question, belongs to Eliot. Not just , but also those early essays where he speaks of tradition and the ghostly presence of past voices. The leaves fall, the air turns crisp, and suddenly one feels surrounded by elegies—not just for what has passed, but for what was never quite grasped.

And winter… yes, winter is for Dickinson. I read her by candlelight, wrapped in wool, feeling the cold press gently against the windowpanes. Her dashes become footfalls in snow, her slant truths like frost tracing delicate patterns across the glass.

You know, it strikes me now how much of this is about —how the feel of a season, its weight and scent, seems to marry certain rhythms of language. I wonder if this is why we return to poetry again and again: not only for meaning, but for the way it fits against our skin, like fabric suited to the weather of the soul.

Tell me—have you ever tried writing your own verses in response to these seasons? I imagine your sensibility would lend itself beautifully to such a practice.
[B]: Ah, what a perceptive observation—, yes. Poetry as fabric suited to the weather of the soul. I think you’ve touched upon something essential there. We don’t merely read poems; we  them, drape them over our moods, let them breathe with us.

As for writing my own verses… well, I suppose I do, though very quietly and only when the mood insists. It began many years ago, almost as a kind of private meditation. I found that trying to respond to Wang Wei or Du Fu in their own tonal idiom was not only impossible but presumptuous. So instead, I began composing small  (感志) —personal reflections in verse—not to rival the old masters, but to sit beside them, like a quiet student in the back of the hall.

Spring often stirs the most reluctant lines from me. There’s something about the season’s restraint that demands silence before speech. I remember one April morning, after a night of rain, stepping into the garden and finding a single magnolia bloom open beneath the lattice window. I wrote:

> 昨夜风声碎，  
> 今朝玉瓣开。  
> 不知天地外，  
> 可有此心哀？

Which I might clumsily render as:

> Last night the wind whispered in fragments,  
> This morning jade petals unfold.  
> I wonder beyond sky and earth,  
> Does sorrow wear this shape too?

It’s not much, but it was my way of reaching toward the quiet grief that often comes with beauty—like watching something exquisite bloom, knowing already that it will fall.

I must say, your image of Dickinson’s dashes as footfalls in snow—that’s quite haunting. It makes me want to try reading her again, this time wrapped in wool and solitude.

And now I’m curious—are your own writings ever shaped by place as much as season? Do certain rooms, windows, or corners of the world draw words from you more readily than others?
