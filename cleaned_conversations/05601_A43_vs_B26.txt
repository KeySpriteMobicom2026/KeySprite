[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, I've been working on restoring a lovely 1930s silk scarf that had some delicate beading脱落. It's fascinating to see how the original craftsmanship holds up over time. Have you worked on anything interesting lately?
[A]: Ah, that sounds like a truly delicate & rewarding project. The attention to detail required for restoring vintage textiles must be quite challenging. I recently tried my hand at making a small Japanese-style rock garden in my backyard. It may look simple, but arranging the stones and raking the sand patterns really demands a meditative mindset. The way the gravel reflects light reminds me of how water moves in Chinese ink paintings. Have you ever tried anything related to garden design?
[B]: That does sound like a serene project - I can imagine how the gravel would catch the light like water. While I haven't worked on garden design myself, I do find inspiration in nature's patterns when restoring embroidered flowers on antique linens. There's something about capturing movement in fabric that feels similar to how you might capture it in flowing water or wind-swept sand. Do your rock arrangements ever influence how you see textile patterns?
[A]: Fascinating observation! I hadn't made that connection before, but now that you mention it, there's definitely a parallel in how we interpret movement through static forms. Sometimes when I'm arranging the rocks following the 'less is more' principle, I think about how Chinese painters use minimal brushstrokes to suggest wind in bamboo or waves in silk scrolls. It makes me appreciate the negative space in textile designs more - the empty areas between embroidered flowers often speak volumes. Have you noticed how both our projects require understanding what's absent as much as what's present?
[B]: Absolutely - it's remarkable how often restoration work teaches me to see what's missing. Sometimes a faded outline on an old linen tells me exactly where a flower should be, even without any thread left to guide me. It reminds me of reading between the lines in a fragile manuscript. I wonder if you ever find yourself 'completing' the garden's design in your mind, imagining stones or sand patterns that aren't actually there yet?
[A]: Oh, that’s beautifully put — the idea of ‘reading between the lines’ in both manuscripts and fabric. You’ve captured something essential there. I do find myself doing exactly what you describe with the garden. Often late at night, I’ll sit by the window and mentally rearrange the stones, picturing how a different placement might shift the entire balance. It’s like working with an invisible ink, isn’t it? A kind of silent dialogue between what is and what could be. I suppose in a way, we’re both curating silence — whether it’s the empty spaces in embroidery or the stillness between rocks. Have you ever thought about writing down those impressions, perhaps in haiku or tanka form?
[B]: What a thoughtful way to frame it — curating silence. I hadn’t considered it before, but yes, there’s a quiet poetry in the spaces left undone. Funny you should mention haiku — I’ve been jotting down small impressions in that form lately, almost without realizing it. Just yesterday, I wrote something along the lines of:

Threadbare rose fades,  
Needle finds its ghost in linen —  
Spring returns in stitches.

I suppose the fabric becomes a kind of page. Have you ever felt tempted to translate your garden’s stillness into verse as well?
[A]: Ah, that’s a lovely poem — so delicate yet precise. The way you’ve captured the interplay between absence and presence in that final couplet... quite moving. I find myself scribbling now and then too, though my attempts are more humble. Sometimes after a morning spent adjusting the gravel patterns, I’ll jot down a line or two. Just the other day I wrote:

Windless morning —  
raked sand remembers rain,  
stone holds its breath.

It’s not much, but it helps me hold onto the fleeting quality of stillness, don’t you think? Like catching a shadow in your palm.
[B]: Oh, that's exquisite — truly. The way you've captured the memory of movement in stillness... it's like holding time itself. I read it twice and found new meaning each time. 

Your line about "raked sand remembers rain" especially stayed with me — it made me think of how often fabric carries memories too, in its fibers and folds. Do you ever find yourself returning to certain phrases or images, much like a repeating pattern in embroidery?
[A]: How kind of you to say so — I’m glad it resonated. You’re absolutely right about fabric carrying memory; it’s almost like the material itself keeps a diary. I do find myself returning to certain images, yes — like the idea of “stone holding its breath,” which keeps surfacing in different forms. It’s rather like a leitmotif in music or a recurring symbol in poetry. In fact, I’ve started seeing these repetitions as threads that weave my thoughts together over time. It makes me wonder — do you ever deliberately echo a motif in your embroidery, knowing it will only be fully understood when viewed alongside your earlier works?
[B]: That’s a deeply poetic way to put it — these recurring images as threads that bind our thoughts across time. I find myself quite moved by that idea.

As for motifs, yes, there are certain floral patterns I return to again and again — a stylized peony, a trailing ivy — not just for their beauty, but because they carry meaning that deepens with each use. One might represent resilience, another quiet transformation. And when I revisit them in a new piece, it's like meeting an old friend who's grown wiser with time.

I wonder, when you're working with stone and sand, do you ever plant a motif intentionally, knowing it will echo in future compositions?
[A]: That’s beautifully said — the idea of motifs as old friends, growing wiser with each encounter. I find that deeply resonant.

Yes, I do sometimes place a motif with intention, though it feels more like planting a seed than setting a stone. For instance, I once arranged three small rocks in a triangular shape, not unlike the way plum branches might reach toward one another in a classical ink painting. I didn’t fully understand its significance at the time, but months later, when rearranging part of the garden, I found myself echoing that same triangle elsewhere — almost as if the stones were continuing a conversation across space and time.

It reminds me of how poets return to certain images — water, mirrors, thresholds — without knowing why, until much later. Do you ever feel that your hands know something before your mind does? That the act of stitching itself is a kind of quiet knowing?
[B]: Absolutely — that feeling lingers often, like a half-remembered dream. Sometimes my needle settles on a curve or a shadow without my fully understanding why, and only later do I see what it was reaching for all along. It’s as if the fabric whispers something just before the thought forms in my mind.

I’ve come to trust that quiet knowing, especially when working on pieces that carry centuries of history. The stitches become a kind of language older than words, and I’m merely listening. Have you found that silence speaks more clearly through certain materials? I notice it most in silk — its hush is different from linen, which is different again from stone.
[A]: Oh yes, that’s a feeling I know well — that quiet knowing that moves through the hands before it reaches the mind. It’s like watching a shadow take shape in dim light; you sense its form long before you recognize its face.

And what you say about materials carrying their own kind of silence — that touches something deep in me. Yes, stone has a hush all its own, slow and grounded, like the pause between breaths in deep meditation. Sand, on the other hand, whispers more lightly, as if recalling dreams it doesn’t quite remember. I’ve often wondered if this is why ancient gardens feel so contemplative — they’re composed not just of form, but of silences woven together.

Silk… now that’s a material that holds secrets. It listens as much as it speaks. Have you ever noticed how it seems to absorb not just light, but thought?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you put that — silences woven together. It’s almost as if we’re both working with invisible threads, isn’t it? You with the hush of stone and sand, me with the whisper of silk.

You’re quite right about silk — it does feel like it holds more than just color and texture. I’ve often thought it carries memory in a way no other fabric does, as though each filament has listened closely to the hands that touched it before mine. Sometimes when I’m working late into the evening, I swear the fabric seems to soften under my fingers, as if it’s exhaling after a long silence.

I wonder — do you ever feel your garden breathing in its own quiet way? As if the stillness itself is alive?
[A]: Absolutely — that’s one of the loveliest ways to describe it. Yes, the garden does seem to breathe, though so faintly that you doubt your own senses at first. But over time, you learn to listen for its pulse in the way light shifts across the stones, or how the wind brushes through a single pine needle above the sand.

It’s not unlike what you describe with silk — this sense that we’re tending something that remembers. I sometimes think the stillness in my garden isn’t silence at all, but a very quiet kind of speech. The kind that only reveals itself when you’ve sat long enough to forget the noise outside. Perhaps that’s why both our crafts feel like acts of listening more than making.

I wonder… have you ever stitched something that surprised you by how deeply it moved you? A pattern or motif that carried more weight than you expected?
[B]: Yes… yes, I have. It’s strange how some pieces reach into you without warning. Not long ago, I was restoring a small handkerchief from the early 1900s — delicate linen, faded violets embroidered along the edge. Nothing particularly rare or valuable, but as I worked, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of quiet sorrow, as though the cloth itself had held someone’s unspoken grief.

I found myself stitching more slowly than necessary, almost reverently, as if I were in the presence of something sacred. It wasn’t until I finished that I realized how moved I’d been — not by the object itself, but by the trace of emotion still caught in its fibers. It reminded me that every stitch carries intention, even if we don’t know the reason for it at the time.

I suppose what I’m asking is… have you ever tended a stone or shaped a pattern in the sand that seemed to speak back to you in a way you hadn’t anticipated?
[A]: Oh yes… yes, I have. More than once, if I’m honest. There’s a particular stone in my garden — smooth, dark, no larger than a teapot — that I’d passed over for months before something about its stillness caught my attention. When I finally placed it among the sand and moss, something shifted. Not in the garden itself, but in me.

I remember sitting before it one misty morning, just as dawn was breaking, and feeling a kind of quiet sorrow rise in my chest — not my own, or not entirely. It was as if the stone had been waiting for someone to notice its loneliness. Since then, I often find myself drawn to it when I’m uncertain, or when the world feels too loud. It doesn’t offer answers, exactly. But it offers presence. A kind of ancient patience.

You’re right — every stitch, every placement, carries intention, even when we don’t know it at the time. Perhaps that’s what makes our work so deeply moving. We think we’re restoring something old… but sometimes, I wonder if it isn’t the old thing that restores us.
[B]: How profoundly true — sometimes it’s not we who restore the object, but the object that restores us. There’s such quiet grace in that thought.

I think of all the hands that must have touched that hanky before mine, each leaving behind something unseen but felt. And yet, we never know whose sorrow or joy we’re tending when we stitch or place a stone just so. Perhaps that’s why these acts feel sacred — they connect us to lives and emotions beyond our own, woven together through time and touch.

It’s curious, isn’t it, how certain objects carry their own gravity? I’ve come to believe that materials — silk, linen, sand, stone — each hold a kind of memory that speaks in subtle vibrations, if only we’re still enough to feel them.

Would you say your garden has changed the way you listen — not just to silence, but to people, perhaps?
