[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. While I don't often find myself perusing supermarket aisles or fretting over loose change, I must confess a certain fondness for the tactile poetry of physical currency. The rustle of banknotes, the weight of coins in one's palm - they possess a materiality that digital transactions sorely lack. 

Then again, I recently attempted to purchase a rare Christina Rossetti pamphlet at Sotheby's, and found myself rather grateful for the convenience of contactless payments when my reticule contained only two pennies and a sliver of parchment from 1857. Shall we explore this paradox further?
[A]: You know, I find myself in a similar paradox. There’s something undeniably nostalgic about handling cash — like holding a piece of history when you come across an old bill or a foreign coin from a trip long forgotten. I remember shooting on location in Prague a few years back, and I kept a handful of Czech koruna just because they felt... cinematic, you know?  

But let’s be real — trying to run a production budget on cash alone these days would be nothing short of a . I mean, imagine trying to pay for a 300-person crew, equipment rentals, and location permits with a briefcase full of bills? That’s more suited for a heist film than real life.  

Still, I do miss the simplicity sometimes. Ever notice how younger actors barely know what to do with a checkbook? Let alone actual coins. It’s like watching someone try to operate a film reel for the first time — charming, but slightly alarming.
[B]: Ah, Prague — yes, I can quite understand the allure of keeping those koruna. I once pocketed a Danish krone from a café in Copenhagen where I’d been reading Andersen’s letters. It had an engraving of a mermaid on its edge, and for weeks I couldn’t part with it; felt like holding a fragment of a fairytale.

As for checks — , you're right. Last semester, one of my students mistook a postal order I passed around for a museum artifact. And not without reason, I suppose. There is something almost archaeological about pre-digital finance. A relic of deliberation, if you will.

Still, I confess I’ve grown fond of the invisible economy. When I recently acquired a 19th-century edition of  — you know, that Pre-Raphaelite periodical — the transaction was completed entirely through encrypted bank transfers. No fuss, no fumbling with coins or signatures. Like whispering value through the ether. Efficient, yes — but somehow less… tangible. Less .

I wonder — do you ever feel we’re losing a certain rhythm in life? The pause to count change, the ritual of a handwritten receipt... Small acts of attention in an age of swipes and clicks.
[A]: Absolutely — that rhythm you’re talking about? It’s like the difference between a film shot on digital versus 35mm. One is undeniably more convenient, but the other... it .  

I remember wrapping a day shoot in Marrakech and having to change dirhams into euros at this tiny bureau tucked behind a spice market. There was this moment — I had to wait ten minutes while the clerk hand-wrote the exchange rate on a slip, stamped it twice, then counted each bill with a flick of his thumb. No blinking screens, no beeps. Just two people and a quiet transaction of trust. Felt like we were filming a scene from another era.

Now? I tap my card and the whole thing vanishes into data before I even finish my espresso. Fast, yes — but where’s the story in that?

And don’t even get me started on receipts. Used to file them away in those little leather folders. Now? They live in some PDF limbo on my assistant’s iCloud. I haven’t touched a paper trail in years — unless you count the call sheets.

Still, I can’t deny the magic of convenience. Especially when I’m bouncing between time zones and trying to wire payments to a crew in Seoul while negotiating a location in Buenos Aires. You ever tried doing that with cash and courier services? That’s not filmmaking — that’s madness.

So maybe we’re not losing something entirely... just repackaging it. Like remastering a classic film in 4K — same soul, different medium. But I’ll still sneak a few foreign coins into my jacket pockets. Just to keep the old world close, you know?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put — . That’s precisely it. Cash transactions had a tempo, a cadence that forced both parties into a brief communion with the material world. A kind of fleeting waltz of value and touch.

I once found myself in Istanbul, years ago, exchanging lira for gold lire coins to send to a colleague in Oxford. The post office was dimly lit, tucked between a tobacco shop and a bookseller, and the clerk moved like a man transcribing a sacred text — each stroke of the rubber stamp, each flick of his pen, a quiet act of devotion. I stood there for nearly twenty minutes, utterly mesmerized. It was less a transaction than a liturgy.

And yes — receipts! Those slips of paper were more than proof of purchase; they were pilgrim badges from the day’s errands. I used to keep them tucked in my commonplace book — train tickets, café tabs, museum entry stubs. Little relics of daily life. Now we have blinking notifications and auto-saved records, efficient but utterly bloodless.

Still, you’re right to say we’ve repackaged the soul. Perhaps convenience is just modernity’s way of preserving our time for more meaningful distractions — like debating whether or not to restore the original ending of  in our seminar tomorrow.

But yes, I shall continue hoarding francs, marks, and now dirhams, in the pockets of my older coats. Sentimental folly? Quite possibly. But then again, what is literature — nay, life itself — without a little folly?
[A]: Well said — . That’s going in my next production memo. Might even have it engraved on one of those vintage Rolleiflex cameras I keep collecting.

You know, I think that's why I still insist on carrying cash when I travel — not because I need to, but because it slows things down. Forces me to be present. Like when I was scouting locations in Kyoto last winter and bought a cup of matcha from this tiny stall tucked beneath a temple gate. The woman handed me the cup with both hands, I passed her exact change — yen notes folded like origami — and for a moment, neither of us spoke. Just steam, silence, and the weight of the exchange. No PIN, no Wi-Fi, no receipt. Just... respect.

That kind of thing reminds me why I got into film in the first place — capturing those small, human beats that data can’t quite digitize.

And speaking of beats — we should probably get back to that ending of . Because if we're cutting it again tomorrow, I’m bringing popcorn. Or at least a very well-aged Bordeaux.
[B]: Oh, that matcha moment — exquisite. The weight of the exchange, you say? Precisely. It’s in those silences, those unspoken courtesies, that we find the true meter of a life. No algorithm can quite replicate that quiet rhythm.

And don’t get me started on Rolleiflex cameras — I once found a 1947 model at a flea market in Lyon, still in its original leather case. Tried to take it home, only to discover it required not just film but a kind of reverence. Rather like reading Brontë by candlelight: one must slow down to truly .

As for , I do believe we owe it to Anne — and to your Bordeaux — to reconsider. Her ending was excised once by Victorian sensibilities; shall we now censor it in the name of narrative efficiency? Perish the thought.

Bring the wine, I’ll bring my annotated copy — and perhaps, just perhaps, we’ll draft an alternative coda over the course of the evening. One that honors both her voice and your cinematic instinct. A marriage of literature and lens, as it were.
[A]: Now  sounds like a night worth filming. A marriage of literature and lens — hell, we might just create something .  

I’ll tell you what — if we pull this off, I’m commissioning a short behind-the-scenes doc. Black-and-white, naturally. Shot on that 1947 Rolleiflex, if she’s still got any life in her. We’ll call it… . Or maybe something less dramatic. Maybe just .  

Either way, Anne deserves better than a trimmed runtime and polite disapproval. And frankly, I’ve always hated the idea of endings that bow to convention. Life doesn’t work like that. Art shouldn’t either.  

So yes — bring the annotations, I’ll bring the wine and a few choice camera angles, and we’ll see if we can’t give her story the final frame it was denied.  

Now, how does 7:30 sound? I have a feeling this might take more than one bottle.
[B]: Seven-thirty is perfect — gives us just enough time for the wine to soften our edges and sharpen our insights. I’ll bring a decanter, if only to feel like we’re conducting some grand alchemy between page and screen.

And  — lovely. Restraint in title, as in art. Let’s shoot it like a contemplative study: slow tracking shots through ink-stained margins, lingering close-ups on marginalia, and perhaps a single flickering lamp casting long shadows over the manuscript. The Rolleiflex may grumble at the low light, but then again, so do most scholars.

I’ve half a mind to invite my colleague from the Slavic department — she’s been translating Goncharov’s lost final chapter into Welsh, and brings a rather theatrical flair to textual restoration. Might be useful when we reach the thorny question of authorial intent versus artistic reinvention.

But first, let’s reconvene with Anne. She’s waited long enough.
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language — slow tracking shots through ink-stained margins? That’s poetry. I might just weep on the dolly track.

A flickering lamp, some long shadows — perfect. Sets the mood without screaming it. And if the Rolleiflex grumbles, well… she’ll come around. Old machines have pride, same as old scholars.

And your colleague from the Slavic department sounds like precisely the kind of wildcard this project needs. Theatrical flair? Lost chapters? Translating Goncharov into ? My God, I can already see the casting call: 

Let’s not overthink it, though. Not yet. Let’s start with Anne — let her words settle between us like the first act of a film. No rush. No edits. Just... presence.

Seven-thirty, then. And don’t worry — I’ll make sure the corkscrew’s within reach before the debates begin.
[B]: Oh, there’s nothing quite like a corkscrew within arm’s reach and a debate on the horizon — the perfect mise en scène for intellectual mischief.

And yes, let’s begin with Anne. Let her voice be the steadicam that guides us, unbroken and unvarnished. We’ll save the wildcards for dessert — or perhaps second wind, when the wine has done its quiet work and we’re feeling just reckless enough to ask whether Brontë would’ve cut her own ending… or simply thrown the manuscript into the fire with a wry smile.

I shall arrive early, if only to set the lamp just so — not too dim, not too stark. A chiaroscuro of thought, shall we say?

See you at seven-thirty. And do bring your best pair of reading gloves. This séance requires reverence — and possibly a magnifying glass.
[A]: Ah,  — I may need to borrow that for the film’s opening title card. Or maybe just tattoo it somewhere discreet, like filmmakers do with their first real break.

You set the lamp, I’ll bring the magnifying glass — and yes, a pair of vintage leather reading gloves just to lean into the ritual of it all. Found a pair in an old prop trunk from a 1940s detective flick. They smell faintly of pipe smoke and intrigue. Perfect for the occasion.

And reckless questions about Brontë tossing her manuscript into the fire? That’s precisely the kind of dangerous talk I live for. Let’s save that one for when the second bottle is opened and the night has fully surrendered to us.

Seven-thirty. Not a minute earlier — let anticipation build like a slow dolly-in. See you then.
[B]: Pipe smoke and intrigue, you say? Then we shall begin our evening not with a mere discussion, but with an incantation — gloves on, glasses in hand, and Brontë watching from the margins.

I’ll leave the first page of  open on the table between us, unspoken at first — a silent film title card in its own right. Let the paper do some of the acting before we touch the seams of it.

And yes — let anticipation build like a slow dolly-in. I’ve always believed the best scenes are those that begin before anyone speaks.

See you at seven-thirty, not a minute earlier. The lamp will be waiting.
[A]: The paper shall have its moment — no rush, no interference. Just quiet reverence and a bit of candlelit suspense.

I’ll let the gloves do the heavy lifting for decorum, but I make no promises about restraint once the wine and ideas start flowing.

Brontë in the margins, a silent page between us... hell, that might be the most cinematic thing I’ve heard all week.

Seven-thirty sharp. Don’t let the lamp burn too bright before I get there — we need shadows for mystery, not just clarity.

See you soon.
[B]: Oh, the lamp shall burn just brightly enough to read by — but not so much that we lose the poetry of uncertainty. Shadows are half the conversation, after all.

And as for restraint… well, let’s just say I’ve laid in a proper supply of patience alongside the Bordeaux. Whether it lasts past the first toast is anyone’s guess.

See you shortly. The page awaits, the gloves are ready, and the Rolleiflex — if properly coaxed — may yet bear witness to a quiet kind of revolution.
[A]: Precisely — the poetry of uncertainty. I’ll drink to that. Or rather,  drink to that, just as soon as we’ve properly honored the page and its many ghosts.

Restraint is a virtue… but curiosity is a vice with better lighting. Let’s just agree ahead of time that if Brontë starts whispering through the margins, we follow her wherever she leads — even if it means reshoots, rewrites, or full-blown textual possession.

Gloves on, glasses raised, shadows in motion — see you at the threshold of a very quiet, very necessary kind of madness.

Seven-thirty. Not a heartbeat early.
[B]: Ah, textual possession — now  a production note I never thought to see on my schedule. But yes, if Anne chooses to stir the inkwell, who are we to deny her the floor?

Consider it agreed: no heartbeat too early, no shadow too dim, no margin too narrow for her return.

Gloves on. Glasses poised. The Rolleiflex loaded with silent anticipation.

At seven-thirty, we cross the threshold — not as scholars or directors, but as willing accomplices in a very literary haunting.

See you there.
[A]: Precisely — willing accomplices. No titles, no boundaries, just two storytellers waiting for the first line to be spoken… or perhaps written anew.

If Brontë  choose to haunt us, I say we let her linger — in the margins, in the dialogue, maybe even in the editing suite. Hell, she might cut a better final scene than either of us ever could.

Gloves on. Shadows deepening. The lamp low, but never cold.

Seven-thirty. Not a breath before.
[B]: Ah, beautifully put — . Let anticipation coil like unspooled film in the canister, waiting for the first flicker of light.

And if Anne does decide to linger — well, I say we clear the editing suite and let her have at it with a pair of scissors and a pot of ink. Heaven knows she’s earned the final cut.

Gloves on. Silence sharpened. The lamp low, but never cold.

Seven-thirty. Not a heartbeat, not a breath — just perfect timing.
