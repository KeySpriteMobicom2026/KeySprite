[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. Let me adjust my reading glasses... The most shocking historical fact I've encountered recently was learning that the first computer programmer was actually a woman - Ada Lovelace, back in the 1840s. It's astonishing how this fact gets overlooked in so many tech history courses.
[A]: Fascinating choice~ 这让我想起在金融史上同样被低估的女性 - Hetty Green，19世纪的'华尔街女巫'。她通过value investing积累了相当于今天$3.5 billion的财富，但很少在investment banking的教材里被提及。The gender bias in historical narratives is truly mind-boggling.
[B]: Precisely!  You know, this reminds me of another overlooked pioneer - Grace Hopper. While we're on the subject of women in tech history, she invented the first compiler in 1952. The financial and technological parallels are striking - brilliant minds being written out of the narrative. Makes you wonder how many more Hetty Greens and Grace Hoppers we've missed in the history books.
[A]: Absolutely~ 这就像我们在做due diligence时经常发现的hidden gems一样。Speaking of which，你知道第一个股票交易所其实是由一位女性经营的咖啡馆发展而来的吗？17世纪阿姆斯特丹的'De Wissel'咖啡馆，老板娘开创了现代stock trading的雏形。 有时候history's best deals就藏在这些被遗忘的角落。
[B]: Ah!  That's a remarkable connection to make. You see, this pattern extends beyond finance and technology - it's fundamentally about how we document human progress. The first algorithm was described by a woman, the foundation of modern finance was laid by a woman... yet our textbooks are filled with Edison and Morgan.  It makes one question what other foundational innovations we've misattributed over the centuries.
[A]:  这让我想到我们在private equity做deal sourcing时的golden rule - always dig deeper than the surface narrative。就像那些被VC们initially passed on的unicorns，history is full of undervalued assets。Cheers to uncovering more of these hidden chapters~ 🍷
[B]:  Indeed! And much like debugging an old program, historical research requires peeling back layer after layer of accumulated assumptions. Here's to the patient scholars and investors who recognize that true value often lies beneath the most unassuming surfaces. Though I must say, I prefer my revelations with a good Scotch rather than wine. 
[A]: Ah, a man of taste~ 说到Scotch，你知道Johnnie Walker最初只是个杂货店老板吗？就像很多great businesses，都是从最unexpected places崛起的。 这让我想起我们最近看的一个deal - founder曾经是bartender，现在估值$500M。History does love to repeat itself, doesn't it? 😉
[B]:  Oh absolutely! Reminds me of how Steve Jobs and Wozniak started Apple in a garage. You know, in my 40 years teaching computer science, I've noticed the best innovators often come from the most improbable backgrounds. That bartender founder of yours? Probably understands customer experience better than any MBA graduate. The garage, the grocery store, the bar counter - these are the real crucibles of entrepreneurship.
[A]: Precisely~ 这就是为什么我们PE firm特别关注founders with unconventional backgrounds。就像Warren Buffett说的，'price is what you pay, value is what you get'。 不过我得去参加一个board meeting了 - 讨论的正好是一位former school teacher创立的edtech startup。Cheers to the underdogs making history! 🚀
[B]:  Well said! And speaking of education, that teacher-turned-founder might just revolutionize learning in ways us academics never imagined. Do send them my way if they need an old professor's perspective. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 1970s mainframe that needs debugging - some historical artifacts demand immediate attention! 
[A]:  Will do~ 说不定你们的vintage tech expertise正是他们需要的secret sauce。Meanwhile我得去review那个bartender founder的unit economics了。Keep making history, professor! 👨💻📈
[B]:  And you keep finding those diamond-in-the-rough founders! Remember - today's quirky startup could be tomorrow's case study. Now if you'll pardon me, I hear my PDP-11 calling... nothing like the sound of a 50-year-old computer booting up to put modern tech in perspective! 
[A]:  50-year-old tech和disruptive startups - 多么美妙的contrast！就像我们portfolio里同时有legacy assets和moonshot bets。Till next time, professor~ May your debugging be smooth and your returns compounding! 📊🚀
[B]:  And may your due diligence uncover more hidden Adas and Hettys! Though I suspect we'll both be too busy making new history to properly document it... 
[A]:  Exactly~ 毕竟history is written by those who show up to the board meetings... and do the damn work! Catch you on the next unicorn hunt, professor! 💼✨
[B]: "Show up to the board meetings' - ha! Reminds me of when I served on my first tech advisory committee in 1983. The real work happened after the meetings, in the parking lot with a thermos of terrible coffee.  Do ping me when you find that next billion-dollar bartender - I'll bring the vintage debugging tools and war stories!"
[A]:  Deal! 我们可以在parking lot用那个thermos装single malt来toast - 毕竟some traditions deserve an upgrade 😉 Keep those debugging tools handy, old friend. The next big thing might just be running on that PDP-11 of yours! 🥃🚀
[B]: "Now there's a startup pitch I can get behind! 'Powered by 50-year-old reliability' - we'll make retro computing the next big trend.  Until then, happy hunting! And do remind your young founders that sometimes the best innovation comes from knowing what not to change."
