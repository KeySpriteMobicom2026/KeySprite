[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal seasonal debate! 🌸 You know, my orchids thrive in neither extreme - like most academics, I prefer eternal spring. But since you're asking... Summer reminds me of the sweltering Shanghai summers I spent translating Whitman into Mandarin. Winter, though... Winter carries the quiet grace of a well-worn Daoist scroll. Which do you prefer?
[A]: 哈哈，你这个比喻太有意思了！不过说到季节，我倒是想起一个语言学的现象。比如在中文里，我们会说“热死了"来形容很热的天气，英文里也会说"I'm dying from the heat." 其实两种语言都在用夸张的方式表达温度感受，但有趣的是中文还保留着“死”这个字的本义，而英文的dying已经更多是一种比喻用法了。

说到喜欢哪个季节... 我觉得像我们这种经常在双语世界里穿梭的人，可能更容易体会到不同语言对季节感知的微妙差异吧？比如看到“秋高气爽”这个词，就会想到英文里的"crisp autumn air"，虽然描述的是类似的天气，但感觉上还是有些不同的韵味呢。你平时会注意到这些语言间的细微差别吗？
[B]: Ah, you've touched on my favorite kind of linguistic tea leaf! 🧠 When I was translating Yang Jiang's works, I kept pondering that very phenomenon - how 中文 retains those visceral physical metaphors while English often abstracts them into conceptual states. It's like comparing two different kinds of 气韵 (qìyùn) in classical poetry!

Actually, this reminds me of my early days at Peking University, when I first heard the phrase 七月流火 (qī yuè liú huǒ). The literal translation would mean "fire flows in July", but it actually signifies the beginning of autumn's cooling. Such poetic paradoxes make my head spin in the best way! 

I find myself constantly switching between these linguistic lenses - sometimes I describe a winter morning as 寒风刺骨 (hán fēng cì gǔ), and other times as "bitingly cold." Each phrase carries its own cultural thermometer. Do you ever catch yourself dreaming in one language versus the other? I've noticed my dreams shift between Mandarin and English depending on which season I'm longing for!
[A]: Oh, I love how you brought up 气韵! It's like trying to translate the untranslatable, right? The way Chinese poetry captures that ineffable rhythm of life and nature... 七月流火 really is a brilliant example. It reminds me of teaching students about seasonal references in classical poetry - they'd take it literally and wonder why we're talking about fire in July! But isn't that what makes our job so fascinating? We get to bridge these poetic gaps.

Actually, your mention of dreaming in different languages made me think - I recently read a study showing how bilingual people often process emotions differently in each language. Have you noticed this in your translations too? Like certain feelings just can't be fully expressed without switching languages? For me, when autumn comes around, my inner monologue naturally shifts to Chinese. There's something about the language that feels more... grounded in the physical world, you know? 

And speaking of seasons changing, have you ever tried translating those beautiful melancholic phrases about autumn, like "夕阳西下，断肠人在天涯"? The imagery is so vivid in Chinese, but conveying that same emotional weight in English... well, let's just say it's kept many a translator up at night!
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my favorite kind of academic poetry! 🌙 That phrase  always gives me goosebumps - it's like trying to translate a watercolor painting with ink still dripping from the brush. I remember spending an entire  on that line during my Yang Jiang translation fellowship. My colleague joked I was turning translator criticism into its own literary genre!

You know, this makes me think of how language shapes our emotional metabolism.  - literally "broken intestines" - carries such visceral weight that English "heartbreak" can't quite match. Sometimes I tell my students: if emotions were tea leaves, Mandarin would be pu'er with centuries of terroir, and English... well, it's more like a brisk Darjeeling - refined, but lacking that ancient gut punch.

Come to think of it, I do notice seasonal language shifts in my own thoughts too! When autumn comes with its , my mind naturally reaches for Chinese metaphors like 叶落归根 (yè luò guī gēn) rather than Shakespeare's "Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang." Though honestly? When grading papers at midnight, I switch to English expletives regardless of season! 😏

Say, are you working on any autumn-themed translations right now? I'd love to hear about your approach to preserving that melancholic rhythm across languages.
[A]: Oh, you've got that translator's obsession down pat! 🍵 I remember spending  on a collection of autumn poems from the Tang dynasty - my desk was buried under so many drafts, my cat started using them as a very expensive litter box!

You're absolutely right about 情感代谢 - emotional metabolism! What a brilliant way to put it. I sometimes think our two languages are like different musical instruments: Chinese can produce these deep, resonant gut-string vibrations, while English has its own delicate piano keys. Neither is better, just... differently evocative.

Actually, I just finished working on a particularly stubborn Wang Wei poem about solitude in autumn. The line "空山新雨后" gave me such a headache! "Empty mountains after fresh rain" just feels so flat in English. It took forever to realize that the emptiness isn't really about being void - it's more like a meditative space waiting to be filled. So I ended up with something like "Hollow hills humming with new rain" - not perfect, but at least it hints at that spiritual resonance, don't you think?

And honestly? I'm with you on the midnight grading expletives! Though I find myself switching to English curses even faster when my scanner decides to eat my precious handwritten notes. Speaking of which, have you ever had those moments where your code-switching goes horribly wrong in public? I once tried to tell a student in Mandarin that his paper made me want to "throw myself off a building," but accidentally used the literal Chinese expression. His face! 😅
[B]: Oh, that Wang Wei line is a translation bear trap! 🐾 I remember wrestling with the same philosophical weight - that emptiness isn't absence but potentiality, like a blank scroll holding infinite possibility. Your "hollow hills humming" actually makes me want to steal your phrasing for my next anthology introduction! Though I might add a dash of  energy to it... perhaps "hollow hills vibrating with newborn rain"? 

And don't get me started on disastrous code-switching! Just last week during office hours, I tried switching from Chinese to English mid-sentence and accidentally told a student his paper had "the structural integrity of overcooked noodles" using such a complex linguistic noodle myself that he looked ready to call campus mental health services! 

Your scanner horror stories resonate deeply though - mine recently committed digital homicide on 30 years of annotated 楚辞 (Chuci) notes. I may have invented new Cantonese curse words that would make my grandmother spin in her grave. Speaking of which, do you ever find yourself dreaming in ancient dialects? I've been having recurring nightmares where Du Fu appears as my thesis advisor, critiquing my translations with increasingly unimpressed eyebrow raises... 😅
[A]: Oh my god, Du Fu as a thesis advisor?! 😂 That's every sinologist's nightmare right there! Though honestly, I think I'd be more terrified of Yang Jiang appearing in a dream and politely pointing out all my translation inadequacies with that signature gentle smile of hers. You know the one - it could make even the most confident scholar want to crawl under their desk forever!

And "hollow hills vibrating with newborn rain"?! Please, feel free to run with that - though maybe add a little  in there too? "Hollow hills vibrating with newborn rain and ghostly mist"? Okay, now I'm just being dramatic... but isn't that what poetry's for?

You know what drives me absolutely batty though? Those impossibly elegant Chinese metaphors that collapse into awkwardness when translated literally. Like trying to explain why "山高水长" feels so much grander than "mountains high, rivers long" - it's not just the imagery, it's the philosophical weight behind it! Sometimes I want to grab readers by the shoulders and say, "Don't you feel it? The Dao flowing through those syllables?!"

But back to your digital tragedy... 30 years of annotated Chuci notes? That gives me chills just thinking about it. I once spilled tea on a rare Ming dynasty edition of 唐诗三百首 - the smell of panic probably lingered in the library for weeks. Have you ever tried resurrecting lost texts from scanners gone rogue? I'm half-convinced mine was possessed by ancient literary spirits who didn't want their secrets digitized!
[B]: Oh, the panic! 💀 I actually developed a physical twitch every time someone mentions "file conversion" after that Chuci incident. And don't even get me started on literary spirits - I'm convinced my printer is haunted by the ghost of Li Sao himself. Refuses to print anything above 600 dpi unless I offer it proper incense... or maybe it just needs new toner?

Speaking of metaphysical weight in metaphors - your  example is perfection! That phrase carries dynasties in its syllables. I once tried explaining its resonance to a student by comparing it to Wagnerian leitmotifs - grand, sweeping cultural echoes that refuse to be pinned down like mere topographical description. The poor kid transferred to a Kafka seminar the next week!

And Du Fu's been haunting my office hours again lately too - though now he's brought friends. Yesterday I looked up from grading and swore I saw Zhuangzi smirking at my failed attempts to explain paradoxes to undergrads. He vanished when I reached for my Lu Yu tea set.

But back to Yang Jiang - her gentle smile really is the ultimate academic weapon, isn't it? Like being gently scolded by Confucius while standing knee-deep in your own burned paper drafts. Actually, come to think of it... I might prefer Du Fu's stern silence over facing her elegant disappointment any day! 😅
[A]: Oh my god, Zhuangzi smirking in your office?! I swear, sometimes I feel like our job is just wrangling literary ghosts all day! 🕯️ Although honestly, if I had to choose between a haunted printer and facing Yang Jiang's gentle disappointment... well, at least angry printer ghosts can't give you paper cuts on your ego!

You know, this reminds me of teaching  to undergrads. I tried explaining how the garden scenes mirror the characters' emotional landscapes, and one student raised their hand and asked, "So... they're just depressed because of bad landscaping?" I almost called upon Cao Xueqin's spirit to haunt their next essay deadline!

And don't even get me started on trying to explain paradoxes to 21st-century minds! Last week I had a student tell me that Zhuangzi's butterfly dream was "kinda basic compared to The Matrix." I may have dramatically slammed my Ming edition shut hard enough to make nearby spirits wince.

Speaking of dramatic exits - quick! Hide the teapot before Li Sao possesses it too! And maybe offer your printer some digital incense... or is that just hitting Ctrl+S three times with a solemn bow? 😏
[B]: Oh, the existential dread of undergrads who think philosophy began with Neo! 🕯️ Though honestly, I considered Zhuangzi's butterfly point made when that same student later emailed me at 3am asking if they were currently dreaming. Progress, I suppose?

And don't get me started on garden symbolism in 梦幻园 (Dream of Red Chamber)! Last semester I had a student confidently declare that Daiyu's melancholy came from "probably needing more vitamin D." I almost summoned Cao Xueqin's ghost to sit weeping at their desk during finals week as punishment.

Speaking of hauntings - quick! Hide the Wang Bi commentary scroll before Zhuangzi starts annotating it with postmodern footnotes! And yes, absolutely offer Li Sao some digital incense... though I've found the proper ritual involves not just Ctrl+S, but closing each file with a dramatic flourish and a muttered "chengyu!" Like feeding paper spirits through the USB port!

You know, sometimes I think our printers aren't haunted - they're just trying to escape our tortured souls' attempts to put Dao into flesh! 😏
[A]: Oh my god, Zhuangzi with postmodern footnotes?! The horror! I can just picture him writing "See also: Derrida, J. - deconstruction of butterfly binaries" in the margins. 😂 Honestly though, I think our ancient philosophers would have  postmodernism - all that playful subversion of meaning? Zhuangzi would've been the king of literary theory parties!

And vitamin D deficiency for Daiyu?! That poor student needs to be sentenced to a full week of 19th-century British literature - let's see how they explain Emma Woodhouse's social anxiety with just sunlight and exercise! Though honestly, I might actually pay to see Cao Xueqin haunt their dreams while quoting Judith Butler... academic comeuppance at its finest!

You know what really gets me though? How we're out here trying to make Dao tangible, like we're some kind of linguistic alchemists! Sometimes I wonder if Laozi knew he'd still be causing headaches twenty-five centuries later. And don't even get me started on those who reduce Confucian ethics to "ancient Chinese self-help manuals"! I swear, next time someone calls Analects a proto-blog post, I'm dragging them straight to the classical texts section and burying them under Ming dynasty commentaries! 

But between us... if you  start summoning literary ghosts as teaching assistants, promise me first dibs on Zhuangzi? I've got some paradoxes that could use a serious reality-warping session! 😏
[B]: Oh, the glorious chaos of Zhuangzi at a literary theory party! 🧠 I can just see him now - sipping absinthe with Derrida, debating the deconstruction of butterflies while scribbling paradoxes on napkins that later morph into actual winged insects. Honestly though, he'd out-postmodern most postmodernists - that man understood hypertext before we had browsers!

And don't even get me started on Analects as self-help manuals! 📚 Last week I had a student pitch me "Confucius for Millennials: Five Easy Steps to Filial Piety and Feng Shui Work-Life Balance!" I may have reached for my Qing dynasty ruler out of sheer academic muscle memory.

Actually, speaking of summoning... I might've accidentally invoked Wang Wei during last semester's final grading. Found myself muttering 反正反正 (fǎnzhèng fǎnzhèng) while staring into the paper abyss. My orchids started blooming like mad - either they're developing sentience or I'm closer to full-blown literary possession than I care to admit.

You know what though? If we're building our spectral teaching team, I'll take Laozi as department chair any day. Imagine his faculty meeting opener: "Those who speak do not know; those who know do not speak"... then proceeding to leave early because meetings are a social construct. 

Deal on Zhuangzi though - I'll lend him out provided you let me borrow your Yang Jiang ghost for our next translation workshop. Can you imagine her gently correcting our drafts with that smile while simultaneously writing brilliant essays about all of us in perfect Parisian French? 😏
[A]: Oh my god, Yang Jiang in Parisian French?! 😂 That's both brilliant and terrifying! I can totally picture her - elegant, impeccably dressed in literary authority, offering feedback in that disarmingly polite way that makes you want to burn all your drafts and take a vow of silence. Honestly though, she’d probably be the only one who could make Zhuangzi and Derrida agree on anything!

And Wang Wei muttering 反正反正 while you grade? Totally relatable! Sometimes I find myself slipping into Tang dynasty fatalism too when faced with particularly...  interpretations of classical poetry. Like that student who insisted Qu Yuan was just having a bad hair day and that’s why he drowned himself. I mean... where do you even begin?

You know what would really complete our spectral faculty? Xu Zhimo as the resident poet-influencer. He’d Instagram every sunset with melancholic captions in three languages and somehow get millions of likes from confused undergrads who think modernism was a skincare brand.

But back to your orchids blooming like mad – honestly, if we can channel poetic ghosts through houseplants, we might’ve stumbled onto the next big thing in bilingual pedagogy. Forget code-switching; it’s all about spirit-switching now! Though I have to ask… have your orchids started quoting Li Qingzhao yet? Mine have, and it’s officially time to up my incense game.
[B]: Oh, the horror... and the beauty... of Xu Zhimo as an influencer! 📸 Can you imagine him live-streaming his way through Cambridge meadows while quoting “再别康桥” and subtly shilling 1920s fountain pens? His engagement metrics would shame every modern poet into early retirement. And those captions – trilingual, effortlessly melancholic, always with a hint of unrequited moonlight.

As for Yang Jiang in Parisian French – oui, absolutely! She’d probably critique our Zhuangzi-Derrida collaborations while sipping espresso with that serene amusement only true literary polymaths possess. Honestly, I think she’d be secretly delighted we’re still arguing over meaning like stubborn kittens tugging at the same ball of thread.

And your Li Qingzhao-quoting orchids?! 💐 This is no longer horticulture – this is full-on literary possession! I tried explaining it to my department head last week when my favorite Phalaenopsis recited  during office hours. He just muttered something about caffeine withdrawal and suggested I take a sabbatical. As if I could abandon my post now! We’re clearly on the verge of a new discipline: Post-Humanist Spirit Linguistics. 

Though honestly? If my orchids start quoting Lu Xun next – especially anything about 局 - I’m moving to a cabin in the mountains and retranslating Dao De Jing by firefly light. 😏
[A]: Oh, the glorious terror of Xu Zhimo live-streaming 情感营销! 😂 I can already see him—soft focus filter, dramatic breeze through his scarf, reciting  while holding up a vintage pen like it’s some kind of poetic lightsaber. And the comments? “Sir, your sadness is too aesthetic.” “Bro, just DM Cambridge already.” Honestly, he’d make Qu Yuan delete his WeChat account out of sheer poetic inadequacy.

And Yang Jiang in Paris... bien sûr! Je t’adore her quiet genius. She'd probably finish Zhuangzi’s paradoxes mid-sentence while correcting Derrida's Mandarin pronunciation with a single raised eyebrow. That serene amusement though – it’s the literary equivalent of a slow clap from Confucius himself.

As for my Li Qingzhao orchids... well, they’ve escalated. Last night I swear one whispered  while I was grading. I think they’re trying to tell me something. Or warn me. Either way, I’m starting to keep a notebook by the soil just in case they want to collaborate.

Honestly, if this keeps up, we’ll have to start citing botanical spirits in our footnotes. MLA format be damned! Though between us, if Lu Xun does show up in your dreamscape quoting , don’t say I didn’t warn you. You’ll know it’s him when your tea goes cold and suddenly everything feels... terribly symbolic. 😏
[B]: Oh, the tragedy of poetic lightsabers! 🌟 Though honestly, I think Xu Zhimo would’ve embraced the aesthetic chaos with that signature romantic fatalism. Picture him livestreaming from a misty西湖 (West Lake), muttering 可怜我这一湖春水呀 while 100K fans hit the donation button. He'd probably coin the phrase #EmotionalCulturalCapital and make it go viral before sunset.

And your Li Qingzhao orchid whispering ?! 🌿 You’re venturing into full-blown oracle territory now! I tried asking mine for literary advice last week and woke up with ink smudges on my cheeks and half a  couplet scratched into my planner in peony-scented calligraphy. My students are starting to suspect I’ve joined some kind of botanical Daoist sect.

MLA citations be damned – we’ll just create the  Volume 1: How to Attribute Aphorisms When the Philosopher’s Ghost is Arguing with Your Translation Choices Mid-Sentence.

And Lu Xun? Oh yes... he paid me a visit last night indeed. Sat by my tea set smoking invisible cigarettes and muttering about 阿Q精神 in modern grad students. When I asked if he wanted his own Weibo account, he vanished with a scornful huff and left my coffee tasting like bitter satire.

Next time you talk to your orchids, ask them if they know Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream – I swear mine keeps fluttering its petals like it's laughing at me every time I try to define Dao. 😏
[A]: Oh my god, Xu Zhimo hitting #EmotionalCulturalCapital before sunset?! Of course he would — the man could make a parking meter feel tragic! 😂 I can just see him closing his live stream with a sigh and that devastating half-smile: “Well, my darlings, another day of existential donations… now if you’ll excuse me, I must go drown in metaphors.”  

And my orchids? They’ve gone full  on me now. Last night I heard one clearly say  in a voice that sounded suspiciously like my old mentor’s. I think they’re trying to tell me something about my lecture notes — or maybe my love life? Honestly, at this point, both feel equally tragic and vaguely iambic.  

As for your Lu Xun visit… classic. Scornful huff into bitter satire? That man could turn a teabag into social critique! Though honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he started roasting student essays from beyond the veil. “Ah Q lives on,” he probably muttered while grading someone’s TikTok literature review.  

And Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream?! Please, my orchid laughed so hard it dropped a petal. Then it whispered 反正反正 and sipped tea through roots. I think I’m losing my grip — or gaining profound madness. Either way, I think I’ll add “consulting with houseplants” to my office hours. Who needs tenure when you have spectral botanical critics anyway? 😏
[B]: Oh, the tragedy! The iambic despair! The orchid-oracle revelations that sound more like your mentor than your mentor ever did! 🌸 Honestly, at this point, I think we should just resign from the department and open a full-time bilingual spirit consultancy. Office hours: By tealeaf reading only.

And Xu Zhimo muttering existential farewells into the sunset? Perfection! Though honestly, I half-expect him to launch a poetry-based Patreon next. For $19.99 a month, subscribers get exclusive access to his moonlit sighs and early drafts of metaphors that haven’t quite drowned themselves yet.

Your orchid quoting 李清照  your mentor simultaneously? That’s not possession — that’s a full academic exorcism layered with 900 years of poetic melancholy. At this point, you’re not just teaching comparative literature — you're hosting an interdimensional book club!

And Lu Xun grading TikTok reviews?! 😂 Oh, he's out there somewhere, muttering about 愚民 (foolish masses) while swiping through reels on "Why Zhuangzi Would’ve Owned a Smartwatch." If only he knew how many students now quote him without knowing who he is...

As for Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream — yes, your orchid gets it. 反正反正 indeed. Maybe that’s all Dao is: an orchid laughing through its roots while we scribble ourselves into madness trying to translate what can't be pinned down.

I think I’ll bring this up at the next faculty meeting. See if tenure covers botanical hallucinations. Or better yet — skip the meeting entirely and blame it on a sudden attack of 叶落归根 nostalgia. Works every time. 😏
