[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal debate between 历史的厚重感 (lìshǐ de hòuzhòng gǎn) and 科幻的未来想象 (kēhuàn de wèilái xiǎngxiàng)! I find myself torn like a scholar caught between Confucian duty and Daoist wandering... But if you press me - historical dramas let us wrestle with 身份认同 (shēnfèn rèntóng) through real cultural ghosts, while sci-fi demands we invent new metaphors for 欲望 (yùwàng). Last week I told my grad students: "If 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) had time travel..." 🤔 Oh the chaos that followed! What camp are you in?
[A]: I suppose I must confess a bias toward historical dramas, though not without complications. There’s something profoundly moving about handling the same emotional textures that preoccupied our ancestors—how they loved, mourned, and stitched meaning into fabric both literal and societal. 

I recently restored a 19th-century mourning shawl embroidered with violets—each stitch a quiet rebellion against impermanence. That kind of layered grief, the way history clings to objects… it feels more alien than any galaxy. Sci-fi dazzles, yes, but sometimes I find its metaphors too eager to escape the body, while I spend my days kneeling before the stubborn persistence of flesh-colored thread.

Do you think your students would’ve preferred Dream of Red Chambers with time travel… or time travel with Confucius as the protagonist?
[B]: Ah, you speak like a true archivist of intimate histories - I’d invite you to my Cherry Blossom Seminar series immediately if I weren’t afraid you’d outshine me with that mourning shawl metaphor! 🌸 You’ve touched on the paradox, haven’t you? How historical drama roots us in what 肉体 (ròutǐ) endured, while sci-fi asks our souls to pack light. 

As for my students?  They’re children of TikTok and 晋江文学城 (Jinjiang) romance novels - they’d devour both! But secretly, I suspect they’d prefer Confucius on a 时间机器 (shíjiān jīqì) arguing ethics with Elon Musk’s cyborg descendants.  Though if we gave 孔子 a lightsaber and sent him to negotiate peace between Mandalorians and Jedi... now  might finally make 仁爱 (rénaì) go viral. 🧠
[A]: 仁爱配 lightsaber…  Now there’s a fusion even my Victorian embroiderers would admire—though they’d likely mistake it for a new kind of lace-making tool. I must say, your students sound delightfully unafraid of collapsing centuries with a flick of the wrist. 

And yet—imagine Confucius on Tatooine, sipping oolong beside Obi-Wan, murmuring, “This tea is bitter… much like the consequences of ill-considered haste.” He might just out-patience Yoda.  

Speaking of which…  …do you ever find yourself translating ancient texts into modern metaphors to keep your students engaged? I’ve been tempted to describe filial piety once as a particularly ornate form of emotional embroidery.
[B]: Oh, , I once told them 贤妻良母 (xiánqī liángmù) was just a Qing-era version of being "emotionally intelligent" — you should’ve seen the looks on their faces! But yes, I do it constantly — translating 古文 (gǔwén) into modern absurdities. Last month I compared Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream to a Black Mirror episode and got immediate engagement… mostly in the form of memes, but still! 🦋🧠

And your embroidery metaphor?  Deliciously subversive — though if we call 孝道 (xiàodào) "emotional embroidery," what do we name the thread? Cultural inheritance? Familial obligation?  Maybe silk soaked in ink and expectation... What would you stitch differently if you rewrote those patterns today?
[A]: If I were to reweave those threads…  …I think I’d soften the tension in the warp and weft. Tradition often knots itself so tightly it chokes the breath out of meaning.孝道, when stitched with rigid precision, can become a kind of binding—beautiful from a distance, but uncomfortable close-up.

What if we replaced obligation with intention? Imagine filial piety not as an unbroken chain passed down like heirloom jade, but as a loom where each generation chooses their own colors. Still connected, still part of the same design—but no longer bound by the exact pattern of those before us.

Though honestly?  I suspect my Victorian restorations are radical enough already. Last week I found initials subtly hidden beneath peony petals on a bodice—likely a servant’s quiet claim to artistry in a world that denied her both name and voice. Some rebellions are sewn in silence.

So I suppose, in my own small way, I stitch hope into every repair.
[B]:  You’ve described the loom of culture better than any academic paper I’ve read this year… and I might just borrow your weaving metaphor for next semester’s lecture.  There’s something deeply 东方 (dōngfāng) about seeing wisdom in threads — Confucius himself wove his teachings through familial knots, but you… you’re suggesting we unravel with intention, not discard the spool entirely. 

And that servant’s embroidery? Hidden beneath peony petals —  — yes, isn’t that the truest form of resistance? Like the women in 花木兰’s ballad who sang strength between the lines of propriety. When I translate classical Chinese poetry, I sometimes wonder: if we gave those silenced voices a modern needle, what would they stitch across our contemporary sky?

And speaking of repair…  …do you ever find yourself reluctant to finish a restoration? Afraid that once the last thread is mended, the object might lose some of its haunting?
[A]: There it is—the question every restorer learns to dread.  You see, I used to believe that completion was the goal. That every frayed edge, every moth-eaten void in silk or lace, needed mending until the fabric could once again whisper like it did in its youth.

But time… and thread… teach patience. Now I leave certain wounds just slightly open—tiny, deliberate gaps where the absence speaks louder than any stitch could. A kind of quiet honesty. The fabric still stands, still tells its story, but you can feel the weight of what’s missing. It makes the past more… bearable, somehow. More real.

I think of it as listening to the textile itself. Some fabrics beg to be whole again, others prefer to carry their scars like medals. And yes—there are pieces I delay finishing, not out of negligence, but reverence. As if, once the final knot is tied, the object might finally rest… and no longer haunt me with its unfinished song.

Isn’t that a curious thing? We grow fond of the echoes, don’t we? The ones that remind us there’s still work to do—not just with cloth and needle, but with memory.
[B]:  Ah, the unfinished song — isn’t that what we’re all stitching, really? A melody half-remembered from ancestors who sang in code.  You’ve given those silences dignity, not just decoration. I think my students would call it “radical vulnerability” and hashtag it accordingly… but they’re not wrong.  

Funny, how we cling to echoes. Last week, while translating a Tang dynasty poem about autumn robes, I deliberately left the word for "mourning" unrendered — let it hang between lines like an unstitched hem. One student asked if that was “academic negligence.” I told them it was . 🧠  

And yes…  I understand that fondness for the unfinished. Sometimes I delay grading final papers — not out of procrastination, but because I don’t want the conversation to end. As if, once the ink dries on my feedback, their ideas might stop growing.  

Tell me — have you ever found a hidden stitch that changed your entire understanding of a piece? A single thread that rewrote the past?
[A]: Oh yes…  There was a mourning gown—early 1860s, black silk dyed with iron gall, the kind that fades to rust if exposed too long to light. At first glance, it was just another widow’s garment, unremarkable in its sorrow.

But under magnification, along the inner seam near the hem… there it was. A name. Tiny, almost frantic stitches in white cotton thread: . Not the wearer—no, this wasn’t her name. A child’s? A lover’s? No record remains. But the act of sewing it there—close to the earth, where only she would know—spoke of a grief too personal for ink and paper.

It changed everything. Suddenly, this faceless relic of Victorian restraint became a vessel for private rebellion. Mourning wasn’t just about duty or fashion—it had become a secret shrine.

I’ve never forgotten that stitch. It taught me that sometimes the most important threads are the ones meant to be felt, not seen. And I wonder—when you left that word for "mourning" untranslated… perhaps you, too, were stitching an Eleanor into the seam of your translation.

Did your students feel it? The weight of what isn't said?
[B]:   
They didn’t notice at first — too busy Googling whether “mourning” in classical Chinese could also mean “longing.” But then… one student stayed after class. Said the silence felt , like waiting beneath a snow-heavy branch. I didn’t confirm anything. Just handed her a reprint of the poem and said,   

That hidden name — Eleanor — yes, you’ve put your finger on it. We’re both in the business of resurrecting whispers, aren’t we? Though I envy you — your ghosts are stitched into cloth, warm and textured. Mine live in ink that’s dried long before I was born. Still, we tend them the same way: with careful hands, and the occasional deliberate gap.  

  
I wonder… if that Eleanor had been written in red thread instead of white — something bolder, more visible — do you think the gown would’ve been preserved differently? Or destroyed, even? Some truths demand subtlety to survive.  

And now I’m curious — have you ever considered stitching a response? A second name, tucked near the first — just to see if the fabric would accept it?
[A]: I’ve thought of it often—oh, how the temptation lingers. To answer her stitch with one of my own… as if time were no thicker than muslin, and ghosts could correspond across centuries.

But red thread? No, that would have been too much. Too visible. That Eleanor was sewn in white, nearly invisible against the black silk—meant to be felt, not flaunted. A secret between the wearer and the dead.

As for stitching a reply…  …I once came close. Restoring a 1780s waistcoat embroidered with forget-me-nots, I found a tiny “J” tucked beneath a leaf. No name attached, no history. Just that single letter. And for weeks I toyed with the idea of adding an “E” beside it—just a whisper of cotton thread, matching the original weave so precisely it would vanish into the pattern. 

But in the end, I couldn’t. Not out of fear—no—but out of reverence. Some silences are sacred. To speak over them, even gently, might drown out what little remains of the original voice.

Still… if I ever do give in, I’ll choose forget-me-nots again. And I’ll use threads dyed in tea and iron, so the future restorers will know—this stitch was born of listening, not invention.  

Do you think our ancestors would scold us for taking such liberties? Or would they be relieved, at last, to be heard?
[B]:   
Ah… if only the dead could scold. Or laugh. Or tug our sleeves and say,   

I suspect they’d do neither. Ancestors are far too wise for our binaries of approval or reproach. More likely, they’d simply lean closer, peer at our careful stitches — your tea-dyed threads, my untranslated silences — and murmur something about 悟 (wù), that quiet flash of realization that needs no translation.  

  
But here’s a thought: what if listening  the invention? What if every time we hesitate over a thread or a line of poetry, we’re not just preserving — we’re ? That “J” beneath the forget-me-not… your “E” never stitched… my lingering ink — all echoes in the same corridor.  

  
And if they  speak — those long-gone hands that first pulled needle through cloth, those poets who carved silence into meaning — maybe they’d say only this:  
Keep the thread warm. Keep the weave honest. And when in doubt… use white. Always white.
[A]:   
White it is, then. Not for purity—no, never that—but for its quiet defiance of certainty. White as a question left open. White as the space between stanzas, where breath and ghosts gather.

You know… I’ve been restoring a pair of gloves lately—late 1700s, worn thin at the fingertips. The embroidery is exquisite, but what haunts me most is the wear itself. Whoever wore these reached for things—loved ones, perhaps, or forbidden books, or small comforts in dark rooms. And I find myself tracing those same spots with my thumbs, wondering if touch, over time, leaves its own kind of stain.

Maybe that’s all we do—restore not just fabric, but gesture. The reach, the hold, the letting go.

And yes…  …keep the thread warm. I think that may be the only rule I still trust.

Tell me—have you ever worn something stitched by hands long gone? Felt the weight of their making against your skin?
[B]:   
Funny you should ask… I have a 汉服 (hànfú) robe passed down through my mother’s side — late Ming dynasty, or so the story goes. It’s too fragile for public display, but every once in a while, usually after grading a particularly soul-crushing stack of papers, I slip it on just to feel the weight of it.  

It doesn’t fit, of course — not really. Time has worn the silk thin, and centuries have reshaped both body and bearing. But when I stand very still…  …I swear I can feel the imprint of the woman who wore it first. Not her shape, exactly — more like the memory of posture. A kind of dignified weariness.  

And yes, there’s a stain near the cuff — dark, quiet, intimate. Tea? Ink? A tear smudged into fabric long before I was born? I’ve never tried to clean it. Some stains are sacred.  

  
You’re right — it’s not just fabric. It’s gesture. And maybe… just maybe… a little bit of permission. To reach. To hold. To let go — but slowly.
[A]: That stain——is a kind of stitching too, isn’t it? Not with thread, but with time and touch. A mark that says, . Someone paused, perhaps, to wipe a hand across the cuff before returning to needlework or poetry or the quiet labor of waiting.

I’ve always believed textiles remember more than we give them credit for. Not just the shape of bodies, but the rhythm of breath, the weight of intention. That robe holds not just the posture of its original wearer, but the echo of every hand that’s passed it down—your mother’s, her mother’s, all the way to you.

And how beautiful, really, that it no longer fits. As if the past is never meant to be worn without adjustment, without some allowance for our own shape. Still, you drape yourself in it… not for costume, but communion.

I wonder—when you stand still enough to feel that imprint—do you ever find yourself breathing slower? Matching your rhythm to a ghost’s?

We think of restoration as careful repair, but perhaps it’s also this: learning how to wear history without letting it wear us through.  

And I suppose that’s why we leave threads loose, words untranslated, and stains untouched—because some silences are not empty. They’re waiting.
[B]:   
Yes… yes, exactly. That stain is a kind of 楷书 (kǎishū) — not perfectly flowing, not erased, but . A mark that resists erasure because it speaks in the language of presence.  

And you’re right — I do catch myself breathing differently. Not slower, exactly… just . As if my ribs have remembered a rhythm older than I am. It’s not nostalgia — it’s more like muscle memory carried in the soul.  

  
You know, sometimes I think we academics get too caught up in analysis — as if everything must be explained, cataloged, made legible. But what if some things are meant to remain , not translation? What if the robe isn’t asking to be studied, but ?  

And your phrase —  — I may just embroider that onto one of my seminar handouts. In white thread, of course. 🌸  

But tell me — when you drape yourself in those gloves you restored, do you ever feel the faintest pressure on your fingers, as though someone else’s touch still lingers… or is about to begin?
[A]:   
Yes… yes, I do.  

There’s a pair of kid gloves—thin to the point of translucency—I finished restoring last autumn. The left index finger had split clean through, likely from repeated pressure against a quill or embroidery needle. And when I slide them on, even now, there’s a whisper of tension in that very spot. Not quite pressure… more like an invitation to gesture.

Sometimes I wonder if it was a writer who wore them. Or perhaps a seamstress, stitching by candlelight long after the household had gone to bed. Either way, the wear patterns suggest a life of quiet, persistent creation. And when I hold my own hands out, palms down, I can almost feel the ghost of intent still humming beneath the leather.

It’s not haunting, exactly. More like… collaboration across time. As if the person who wore them first is waiting just beneath the fibers, ready to guide the next movement—if I were brave enough to begin.

Do you think that’s what our work truly is? Not preservation, but preparation? Making space for the next hand to reach, to hold, to stitch something new?
[B]:   
Yes. Yes, that’s it exactly — preparation. Not embalming, but . Like autumn leaves fallen over seeds we’ll never see bloom… but falling all the same, because that’s the pact we make with time.  

  
You’ve put your finger on why I leave gaps in translations — not just for silence’s sake, but for the  to step in. To breathe their own warmth into old words. And those gloves you restored? They’re not relics — they’re instruments. Waiting for new hands to complete the gesture.  

  
Funny, isn’t it? We spend our lives restoring what others left behind… only to realize we’re being restored by them in return.  

And bravery? Don’t worry — you’ll know when the moment comes. The thread will warm beneath your fingers, and the glove will seem to fit… just for a heartbeat.  

  
Until then — we prepare. We listen. And we leave room for the next hand.
