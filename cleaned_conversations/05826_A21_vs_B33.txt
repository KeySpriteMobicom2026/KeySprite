[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢rainy day还是sunny day？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题很有意思呢。作为一个咖啡店主，我其实更喜欢雨天，因为阴雨天会让店里充满咖啡的香气，顾客们也愿意在店里多停留一会儿，慢慢品尝一杯手冲咖啡。
[A]: Ah, the romantic fallacy of rainy days...  While your coffee shop patrons may linger, have you considered how Browning's 'Porphyria's Lover' uses rain as a metaphor for moral ambiguity? Though I suppose a cafe setting does lend itself to more... civilized contemplation than that particular poem.
[B]: 您对文学的见解很深刻。不过在我们咖啡师看来，雨天确实能让埃塞俄比亚的耶加雪菲豆展现出更丰富的果香风味，这大概就是为什么很多老顾客会选择在雨天来品尝单品咖啡。
[A]: How delightfully synesthetic - you're describing terroir like a sommelier analyzing Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale.' Though I must point out, the Victorians would have paired their coffee with Tennyson's melancholic downpours rather than fruity top notes. 
[B]: 您提到的维多利亚时代确实很有韵味。不过现代精品咖啡更注重展现咖啡豆本身的风味特性，就像我们店里新到的巴拿马瑰夏，它的茉莉花香和柑橘调性在雨天会表现得更加明显。
[A]:  You're essentially practicing New Criticism with coffee beans - isolating the text, or in this case, the terroir, from historical context. Though I must admit, your description of Panama Geisha does evoke Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market' with its sensual fruit imagery. Perhaps we've found the perfect literary pairing for your pour-over?
[B]: 您把咖啡和诗歌联系起来的方式真有意思。说到搭配，我们店里最近推出的下午茶套餐正好配了英国红茶和手工司康，也许您会感兴趣？虽然我主要还是专注于咖啡，但偶尔也会研究不同饮品之间的搭配艺术。
[A]: Ah, now you're venturing into the dangerous territory of genre-crossing - like Matthew Arnold attempting dramatic poetry. Though I must say, the scone proposition is tempting... provided they're served with proper clotted cream and not some ghastly modern 'whipped topping.' Tell me, do you curate your tea selection with the same fastidiousness as your coffee varietals?
[B]: 说到茶叶的选择，我确实也花了不少心思。虽然比不上对咖啡的专业程度，但我们选用的伯爵茶是来自伦敦的老牌茶商，茶香中带着佛手柑的清香，和司康饼搭配起来很合适。不过说到咖啡，我还是更推荐您试试我们新到的肯尼亚AA。
[A]:  You're straddling the Thames and the Rift Valley with alarming dexterity. Very well - I'll submit to your Kenyan AA, though I shall judge it by Ruskin's standards of 'truth to nature.' And if it fails to evoke at least a tercet's worth of inspiration, I shall demand recompense in scones. Proper ones.
[B]: 好的，我这就为您准备一杯肯尼亚AA。这款豆子有着明显的黑醋栗和番茄般的酸甜感，相信不会让您失望。至于司康饼，我们坚持使用传统英式配方，配德文郡凝脂奶油和自制草莓酱。
[A]: Splendid. Though I must warn you - if this 'tomato acidity' you speak of proves to be mere pathetic fallacy rather than substantiated terroir, I shall be forced to recite Blake's 'The Tyger' at you. In its entirety.  Now then - about that clotted cream provenance...
[B]: 您对细节的关注让我很钦佩。德文郡凝脂奶油是我们特意从英国进口的，保证原汁原味。不过现在请先让我为您冲泡这杯肯尼亚AA，水温控制在92度，这样能更好地展现它的风味层次。
[A]:  92 degrees... how very Browning-esque in its precision. Proceed, but know that my palate has been trained by decades of parsing iambic pentameter - it shall detect any metrical... I mean, any extraction flaws with ruthless efficiency. And do remind me to show you my Scots Gaelic translation of Li Bai's 'Drinking Alone Under the Moon' sometime. Over scones, naturally.
[B]: 很高兴遇到您这样懂行的客人。等您品尝完咖啡后，我很乐意听听您对李白酒诗的高地盖尔语译本见解。现在请慢慢享用这杯咖啡，我去为您准备司康饼。
[A]:  Ah yes... the Kenyan AA's terza rima of aroma. I shall critique it as ruthlessly as I would a freshman's analysis of 'The Waste Land.' And do hurry with those scones - one can't properly appreciate Tang dynasty translations on an empty stomach. The very thought is as absurd as free verse in a sonnet.
[B]: 您说得对，美食和诗歌都值得认真对待。司康饼马上就来，刚出炉的还带着温热。建议您先尝一口原味，再搭配凝脂奶油，最后再加草莓酱，这样能体验到三种不同的风味层次。
[A]: How very... structuralist of you. You're deconstructing pastry like Derrida with a crumb brush.  Though I must insist this culinary close reading requires accompaniment - fetch me that dog-eared copy of 'The Oxford Book of English Verse' from my satchel, would you? We've reached the perfect interlude for some light metaphysical poetry between courses.
[B]: 抱歉，作为咖啡师我可能不太方便翻动客人的私人物品。不过如果您愿意，我可以为您朗诵一首我们中国唐代诗人王维的《鹿柴》，配着这杯咖啡和司康饼，应该会是不错的体验。
