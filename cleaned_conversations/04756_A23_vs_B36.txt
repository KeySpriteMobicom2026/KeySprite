[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that’s a lovely question! I must admit, I’ve been quite the traditionalist when it comes to organisation – nothing beats a beautifully bound notebook and a fine pen for me. But lately, I’ve taken a liking to . It’s wonderfully flexible, much like arranging flowers in a bouquet – you can shape it to your needs! I use it to keep track of guest preferences, special occasions, even my own little reading list. Have you found one that suits you?
[A]: Notion确实是个宝藏App！✨ 我之前也用过不少to-do list类的app，但总觉得少了点。后来发现Notion不只能做task management，还能建一个超有personal风格的design portfolio~ 🎨💻  
我最近在上面做了个mood board，专门收集inspiration，比如看到某个品牌的VI设计很惊艳，就会截图保存上去，配上自己的notes和color palettes~  
不过说到organize工作流，你有没有试过？它那个kanban layout特别适合做项目管理，像搭积木一样把任务分块，视觉上清晰很多💡  
话说回来，你觉得纸质笔记的那种tactile feeling真的没办法被digital完全替代对吧？我偶尔也会手写一些灵感，那种笔尖划过纸面的质感，有种让人专注的魔力😅
[B]: Oh, I do love how you’ve personalised your Notion space – it sounds absolutely delightful! A mood board with colour palettes and inspiration? That’s like keeping a little garden of creativity you can tend to anytime. I must say, I admire that approach – very much like arranging different flowers to see which ones bloom best together.  

As for Trello, yes! I’ve dabbled with it before – the visual clarity is rather satisfying, isn’t it? It gives me the same joy as arranging rooms in the hotel – moving things about until everything feels just right.  

And oh,  – there’s something so grounding about it. I still jot down guest notes in a leather-bound book sometimes; it just feels more… personal. Like leaving a handwritten letter instead of sending an email. Do you find yourself switching back and forth between digital and paper, depending on the task?
[A]: Aww，你形容得也太美了～把灵感花园照顾好的感觉，就是那种每天浇点水、修剪一下，某天突然开出一朵意想不到的花 💐✨  
我也喜欢把Notion空间当成一个会成长的作品，有时加点新配色研究，有时放几段读完后还满脑子想法的文字 📖💡  

说真的，每次用Trello整理好一个project的task list，都会有种完成拼图后的成就感吧？尤其是拖拉卡片的时候，好像在玩一场视觉系的游戏一样哈哈 😅  

至于纸本嘛…我真的会根据不同mood切换！  
比如开会或brainstorming时，我喜欢digital工具，方便快速记录和修改；但如果是写日记或者画草图，我会特别想拿起手边那本牛皮纸笔记本 📝💛 可能因为那种“笔迹即心迹”的感觉，让思绪变得更有温度吧？  
你也算是把工作跟手感结合得很细腻的人呢～像你这种每天面对客人的工作，手写的小细节一定很加分！有没有哪次写下的一句话，后来变成客人特别记得的point？
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully put thought – like tending a garden of ideas, indeed. There’s something so rewarding about nurturing thoughts and watching them bloom in unexpected ways. I couldn’t agree more.

And you’re absolutely right about that puzzle-like satisfaction with Trello – it’s oddly therapeutic, isn’t it? Like everything suddenly clicks into place, even if just for a moment. I find myself smiling a little each time I complete a board, as if I’ve just arranged the perfect setting for afternoon tea – everything in harmony.

Now, your question about handwritten notes… let me think…  
Just last month, there was a guest – an artist from Paris – who mentioned in passing how she missed receiving real letters. On her final morning, I left a small note at her room door, simply saying,  She came back to reception especially to thank me – said it was the first time someone acknowledged her work without asking for a favour in return.  

Little things like that… they stay with people, don’t they? Sometimes all it takes is a sentence, written by hand, to make someone feel truly seen.
[A]: Wow… “May your brushes never run dry.” 这句话真的太温柔了 💫  
它不只是客套，而是真真正正地看见了对方的灵魂啊～  
有时候我觉得，这种small but meaningful gesture，比任何服务标准都更珍贵。你不是在“完成工作”，而是在“传递温度” 💛  

听你这么说，我也想起之前有一次，在画一幅commission illustration的时候，情绪特别低落。结果那位客人收到画之后，回信说：“谢谢你在这幅画里藏了这么多细腻的情绪，好像你也懂我那些没说出来的心事。”  
我当时真的眼眶有点发热…原来我们以为的日常创作，其实可能悄悄照亮了别人的某个角落 🎨✨  

或许这就是为什么我们还是离不开手写的、亲手做的东西吧——因为它们带着“人”的痕迹，有呼吸感，也有心跳声 💓  
你说对吗？
[B]: That’s beautifully said… and so very true. There’s a quiet magic in creating something that carries a piece of your heart — whether it’s a painting, a handwritten note, or even the way you arrange a room for someone special. It’s those subtle layers of  that make an experience memorable, don’t you think?

I love how you put it — that these things carry a heartbeat. We may never know just how deeply our small acts of care ripple outward. And isn’t that lovely? That we can quietly, unknowingly, touch someone’s day — maybe even their soul — with something as simple as a thoughtful line or a carefully chosen shade of blue.

I feel incredibly lucky to work in a place where I get to witness those quiet moments — where a guest remembers not the room number, but the warmth of a greeting, or the way their favourite tea was waiting for them just when they needed it.

Tell me… do you often find inspiration for your illustrations in those unexpected places — like conversations, fleeting emotions, or even a guest’s quiet smile?
[A]: Oh totally——灵感真的常常藏在这些看似平常的缝隙里 💡  
就像你刚刚说的那个巴黎艺术家，还有那位收到画作的客人…这种情感流动的感觉，真的超适合放进插画里！  

我自己最常做的，就是在咖啡厅画画的时候，偷偷观察周围人的小动作或表情～  
比如上次画的一幅《城市独处时刻》，就是从一个女生在角落边喝咖啡边写日记的样子获得的灵感 📖☕️ 她眼神里的那种专注又有点寂寞的感觉，让我忍不住在画里用深蓝和浅紫去描绘那个氛围 🎭  

还有啊，我最近在Notion上收集的一个特别inspiring的照片，是某天早上在巷口拍到的一只猫蹲在窗台上晒太阳 🌞🐾  
它那副“全世界都归我管”的慵懒神态，让我瞬间有了一个系列插画的想法—— 😸✨  

其实有时候，创作不是去找灵感，而是让那些触动我们的情绪自然流出来吧？  
你觉得呢～？😊
[B]: Oh, I love that — letting emotions flow  you rather than chasing them. It’s such a graceful way to create.  

And your  idea? Simply charming! There’s something so poetic about capturing the quiet confidence of a cat basking in sunlight — like it knows something we don’t, some secret rhythm of the world. I can already picture the series — soft shadows, golden light, and just a hint of mischief in the air.  

You know, now that you mention it… I think that’s what I try to do here at the hotel — not , per se, but shape moments that carry a kind of emotional tone. Like setting the stage for little stories to unfold. Sometimes all it takes is the right lighting, a familiar scent, or a well-placed book to make someone feel like they’ve stepped into a scene from their own favourite novel.  

I must ask — have you ever illustrated a memory? Not just a moment you observed, but one that lived inside  — a feeling, a dream, a whisper from your younger self?
[A]: Omg yes……  
其实我有本private sketchbook，专门画那些藏在心底的fragments 💭  
不是给别人看的那种commission作品，而是像日记一样的visual emotions 🎨💭  

比如有一幅叫《17岁的雨天》的插画，就是画我高中时期某个放学后的黄昏——  
那时刚被退稿了第一本漫画企划，整个人都湿漉漉地走在回家的路上，心里又酸又胀，但天空却美得不像话 🌧️🎒  
我就用了很多灰蓝和一点橙黄，像是把那股说不清的情绪color化了 💦  

还有些时候，我会画梦里的场景——那种醒来只记得一点点、但情绪还 lingering在胸口的感觉…  
你会不会也有那种moment，明明什么都没发生，但就是心头一紧，好像过去的自己轻轻拍了你一下？🫂✨  

其实我觉得……  
创作最动人的地方，大概就是让我们有机会跟自己say hi吧 😊  
就像你说的“setting the stage for little stories”——不只是别人的故事，也是我们自己的。
[B]: That must be such a tender space, to hold those fragments of feeling and memory so close, and then give them form through colour and line. I can almost imagine flipping through your sketchbook — each page a window into a moment that once made your heart ache or whisper back at you.

Your  painting… oh, it sounds hauntingly beautiful. The way you described it — the heaviness in the air, the bruised sky, that quiet sting of rejection wrapped in something almost poetic — it makes me think of how we carry our younger selves like delicate books we never quite finish reading.

And dreams… yes, there’s something so elusive about them, isn’t there? Like catching a glimpse of yourself in a mirror just as you’re turning away. I do have those moments, more often than I’d expect. Sometimes it’s the smell of lavender on a summer breeze, or the sound of rain tapping against the window late at night — and suddenly I’m standing in my grandmother’s kitchen again, watching her stir a pot of honeyed tea. You don’t realise how much of your past still lives quietly inside you until something pulls its sleeve.

You’re absolutely right — creation is a way of saying hello to ourselves. And I suppose, in my own small way, I try to offer guests a gentle stage for their own stories, even if they only step into it for a night or two.

Do you ever find that certain pieces call you back, long after you’ve finished them? Like they’re not quite done with you yet?
[A]: Oh my god，你形容得太准了——  
像是在翻一本装满心跳声的书 💭📘  
我有时候看着自己旧作品，真的会觉得：  
“啊，那是我还没说完的话。”  

特别是那幅《17岁的雨天》，每次看到都会有点鼻酸…  
不是因为难过，而是因为心疼那个还在学着跌倒的自己 🫂🌧️  
后来我还在这幅画的角落偷偷加了一行小字：“It’s okay to not be okay.”  
像是一种回信，给过去的我，也给自己 ✉️  

你说的那种“某些作品还没对你说完”的感觉 totally有！！  
有张画我一直没上完色，就是那种…总觉得还没找到对的情绪来收尾的感觉 🖌️💭  
它摆在我桌边两个月了，每天看一眼都觉得：“再等等…”  
可能它想告诉我什么，只是我还没准备好听 😊  

创作真的是面镜子，照出我们自己都没意识到的褶皱和光 💫  
而你呢～在帮别人布置故事舞台的同时，  
有没有哪段客人留下的片段，让你久久不能忘？  
或者说……  
有没有哪个瞬间，你觉得不只是你在服务他们，  
而是他们在悄悄地，陪你走了一小段路？
[B]: Oh yes… there  someone.  

An elderly gentleman, Mr. Whitaker, stayed with us for a week last autumn. He never said much, just a quiet soul with a well-worn notebook and a habit of sitting by the window every morning, sipping tea as though he were waiting for someone to join him.  

One afternoon, I found him in the garden, sketching the old oak tree. We spoke briefly — he told me he used to be an illustrator, long ago, before life gently pulled him in other directions. A few days later, he left his notebook behind — just one page folded over, marked with soft pencil lines and a small watercolour of that same tree, now dotted with tiny red berries. Beneath it, he’d written:   

I never saw him again, but that note stayed with me. It’s tucked inside my favourite book now —  — like a secret promise between strangers.  

Sometimes, I think that’s what we do without realising — we leave pieces of ourselves behind, in the places we rest our eyes, the cups we hold, the words we scribble and forget. And somehow, those fragments find their way into the hearts of others.  

So yes… they do walk with us, if only for a little while.
[A]: Wow… “Still listening.”  
这句话像一滴墨，掉进心里就慢慢晕开了 🫂💧  

那个画面好温柔啊——一个老人、一本旧笔记本、还有一棵在风里的树 🌳📒  
他用铅笔和水彩留住时间，而你用记忆留住他…  
这种相遇真的不是偶然，而是两个灵魂在同个频率上轻轻碰了一下 💫  

我好想把这个故事画下来诶——  
可以是清晨的光透过树叶洒在他肩上，纸上是半完成的树影，旁边还放着那杯没喝完的茶 ☕️✨  
或许这就是所谓的“无声的陪伴”吧？不是刻意要说些什么，但存在本身就已经很动人了…  

谢谢你告诉我这个片段 🙏  
原来在酒店工作的你，不只是服务别人，也在悄悄收藏这些微小却闪亮的瞬间 ✨  
而Mr. Whitaker留下的那张画……  
它现在一定还在某个地方，继续听着风，也听着你的心事吧 🍂👂
[B]: You have such a gift for seeing the quiet poetry in things… and yes, I think if you painted that moment, it would breathe all over again. The light through leaves, the unfinished sketch, the tea gone cold — all the little things that hold a heartbeat.

I often wonder what Mr. Whitaker would say if he knew his simple note still lingers in someone’s heart. Maybe that’s the secret after all — that we don’t need grand gestures to leave a trace. Just a line drawn with care, a colour placed just so, a sentence whispered into the pages of a forgotten notebook.

And you're right — it wasn't just him passing through my days. It was us, briefly walking the same path, even if he never knew it.

You know, Margaret… I think we’re not so different, you and I. We both collect moments — you in ink and watercolour, and me in greetings, goodbyes, and quiet conversations by the window.

Would you ever consider illustrating stories like this one? Not just for guests, but stories born from the spaces between — the ones no one else thinks to tell?
[A]: Oh… ～？  
等等，你是不是偷偷给我取了个笔名啊哈哈哈哈哈 💃✨  
不过说真的，被你这么一说，我都想开始一个叫《路过心房的旅客》的插画系列了——  
专门画这些擦肩而过却留下温度的故事 🖌️🫂  

像Mr. Whitaker的水彩树、你的温柔记忆、还有那些没说完的话…  
我觉得这些都不是“偶然”，而是宇宙悄悄安排的小连载呢 🌌📖  

如果真要画成故事，我可能会用很soft的色调，像是回忆刚醒来时的那种朦胧感 🌫️🎨  
每一页都像一封没有寄出的信，里面有光影、有茶香、还有一点点潮湿的心事 💧💌  

你说我们都在收集moment，  
那我想请你一起完成这个系列好不好？  
你可以写下那些留在心底的客人故事，  
而我负责把它们变成画面——  
就像你为他们布置舞台，  
我来点亮灯光 💫  

你觉得这个想法怎么样？😉
[B]: Oh… …  
I think that’s one of the most beautiful ideas I’ve ever heard.  

It feels just right — like finding an old letter in a book you’d long forgotten you were holding onto. There’s something so tender about it, so full of quiet wonder. And yes… those moments weren’t accidents. They were little constellations placed along our path, guiding us without hurry.

Imagining it with soft tones, like the world seen through morning mist — I can almost feel the paper between my fingers, smell the ink as it settles into the page. Each illustration, a gentle echo of someone’s story. A tree drawn by morning light. A teacup left behind. A note folded and tucked away like a secret.

And you inviting me to be part of it… well, that’s quite something. I’d be honoured to write those stories — to pull them gently from memory and place them in your hands like fragile things wrapped in cloth. Together, we could give them shape, colour, breath.

So yes, Margaret… let’s begin this.  
Let’s bring those fleeting hearts into the light — one page, one painting, one whispered moment at a time. 💫🎨📚  

I can hardly wait to see where the first story takes us.
[A]: Oh my heart～💫  
你这封“合作邀请”真的让我胸口一热…  
好像我们已经不只是在聊天，而是在同一个画布上轻轻落下第一笔 🎨🫶  

那就这么定了——《路过心房的旅客》系列正式启动！（虽然只有我们两个人知道哈哈哈 😂）  
你负责从记忆里打捞那些温柔的碎片，像拾起一片片落叶一样小心收藏；  
我呢，就用颜色和线条把它们变成可以触摸的梦境 💭🖌️  

我已经开始幻想第一幅的画面了：  
晨光斜斜地洒进窗台，茶杯还留着半温的圆圈，笔记本摊开在桌上，风正轻轻翻动书页…  
而在角落里，或许有一双看不见的眼睛，也正在温柔地看着这一切 👀✨  

谢谢你让这些故事有机会重生～  
让我们一起，慢慢地，把那些被遗忘的心跳，一笔一笔画回这个世界吧 💓📚  

P.S. Margaret这个名字…我居然开始有点习惯了哈哈！！  
谁说这不是另一个小小的奇迹呢？😊
[B]: Oh, my dear fellow storykeeper…  

There’s something so profoundly joyful about this moment — like standing at the edge of a quiet forest, just before the first light breaks through the trees. It feels like we’re not just beginning something creative… we’re breathing new life into moments that once brushed past us, unseen but deeply felt.

I can already picture your brushstrokes giving softness to silence, colour to memory. And I promise to bring each story with the care of someone tending to an old garden — gently uncovering what time may have hidden, but never truly lost.

Let’s take our time with this, shall we? Let each piece unfold like a letter arriving just when it’s needed most. There’s no rush when you're painting heartbeats and I’m writing echoes.

And oh…  Who knew such a name could feel like a warm hand on the small of your back, saying,  😊

So yes — slowly, softly, we begin.  
One story. One sketch. One remembered heartbeat at a time. 💫📖🎨
