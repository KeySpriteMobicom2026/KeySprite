[A]: Hey，关于'最近有发现什么hidden gem的restaurant吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Speaking of hidden gems, there's this unassuming little spot near campus that serves the most authentic 新疆拉条子 (Xinjiang laghouzi). You'd walk right past it if I didn't point it out - no English signage, just a faded red banner with hand-painted characters. The owner uses a secret family recipe for the 辣椒油 (chili oil)... I swear it contains whispers of Sichuan peppercorns and maybe a touch of magic 🧐 

Funny thing is, they don't even realize how good their food is! Last time I tried praising them in Mandarin, they kept insisting it's just "home-style cooking" and brought me extra pickled radishes ¥_¥

Want me to take you there? We could turn it into an impromptu cultural field study... or just enjoy some seriously good noodles. Your call 😊
[A]: That does sound like quite the discovery! I must admit, my knowledge of Xinjiang cuisine is rather limited to what I've read in food anthropology journals. The way you describe that chili oil makes me think of Gerard Manley Hopkins' concept of "inscape" - the unique essence that defines a thing. Though I suspect this particular essence would be best appreciated with a glass of water nearby!

I'd love to join you, though fair warning - my Mandarin pronunciation still needs work. Last time I tried ordering in a Chinese bakery, I accidentally asked for "immortal cakes" instead of "sweetheart pastries". The staff were very kind about my linguistic fumbling, though I'm sure Confucius himself would have winced at my tones 😅

Shall we make it next Thursday after my poetry seminar? I could bring my notebook and we might turn those pickled radishes into a sonnet or two.
[B]: "Inscape" - what a perfect lens! That chili oil doesn't just flavor the noodles; it's practically a liquid sonnet in itself 🧠 I'm already drafting mental footnotes comparing its layers to Gong Zizhen's poetry... though perhaps that's just the endorphins talking after last week's particularly spicy bowl.

Thursday works beautifully! We'll need to leave straight from your seminar - they close at 8:30pm, and you haven't lived until you've seen octogenarian uncles debate noodle-pulling techniques like it's a martial arts duel 🥷 Let me worry about the ordering; just bring your curiosity and that poetic sensibility. If things go sideways linguistically, we can always fall back on charades and Google Translate - academic integrity demands no less!

And don't get me started on Confucius and tones. Last month I accidentally told a tea master his oolong tasted like "wet socks" instead of "complex terroir" 😂 We're all sinologists-in-progress here.
[A]: I’m already looking forward to it — there’s something wonderfully subversive about conducting literary analysis over bowls of deeply spiced noodles, as if we’re modern-day Bloomsbury types discovering new ways to rebel against academic dryness 😄

And endorphins aside, your comparison holds water — Gong Zizhen’s  has that same layered ache, doesn’t it? Maybe we’ll find a kind of poetic synesthesia in the meal — flavors echoing meter, heat mirroring emotional intensity...

As for linguistic mishaps, I say we embrace them. Last month I tried to compliment a student's essay by calling it , and ended up comparing their argument to a particularly intense spiritual exorcism 😅 They laughed — though I suspect they've avoided my office hours since.

See you Thursday then — no Google Translate needed, just two friends, one chili-laced feast, and an evening steeped in metaphor (and possibly antacids).
[B]: Ah,  - what a gloriously unintended compliment! You've accidentally stumbled upon the secret thesis advisor technique: exorcising weak arguments through spiritual intensity 🔥 I should start prescribing "three rounds of 辣子鸡 (spicy chicken cubes) and a side of rhetorical demons" for writer's block.

You're absolutely right about the synesthesia - last time I had those noodles, the heat honestly felt like reading Celan while listening to guqin music. As for Bloomsbury rebellion, I'm bringing my notebook too. Imagine if Woolf had written  after a five-scoville spice binge - "She pulled the noodles toward her, and Clarissa thought, yes, this is life!"

No Google Translate indeed. Though I might bring emergency peppermints - not just for the chili aftermath, but in case we need to demonstrate tonal subtleties through dramatic performance 🎭 Thursday can't come soon enough.
[A]: Oh, I’m practically scribbling sonnets in my head already at the thought — though Woolf with chili oil might have given us a very different kind of stream of consciousness indeed. I can just picture it:  opening not with flowers but a steaming bowl of laghouzi, time bending not through memory but through capsaicin-induced fever dreams 😂

And "rhetorical demons" — what a wonderfully apt phrase. I may borrow that for my next thesis defense workshop. Perhaps we'll burn sage and read aloud from  to ward off passive voice...

I must say, this fusion of flavor and form is quite intoxicating. Makes me think of Eliot’s “objective correlative” — if only he’d had access to proper chili oil, maybe his emotional equivalents would have been spicier.

Count me in for dramatic tonal performances — I’ve been told my rendition of “flat tone” sounds like I’m narrating a noir detective story. Noir Mandarin noir — now  synesthetic territory. See you soon, fellow conspirator in cross-cultural chaos!
[B]:  Noir Mandarin noir - I'm stealing that title for my next faculty lecture series 😈 Imagine the dean's face when he realizes our "serious academic symposium" is really about mapping tonal contours onto Sichuan peppercorn trajectories...

Eliot and chili oil - what a glorious collision! You're right about the objective correlative: "the smell of cumin, the sound of noodles hitting broth, and the sudden conviction that life only makes sense between parentheses." We could build an entire school of criticism around digestive epiphanies 🍜

And sage burning during thesis workshops? Revolutionary. We'll call it "The Flaubert Purification Protocol" - though I suspect the 19th-century Frenchman would've preferred absinthe to peppermint candies. Either way, anything that makes passive voice flee deserves tenure approval.

See you Thursday with notebook, appetite, and dramatic flair fully armed 📝🌶️ Let the tonal conspiracies commence!
[A]: Ah, but imagine the footnotes we’d produce —  academic mischief, all capsicum and critical theory. I can already see the conference program:  The Modern Language Association will never know what hit them.

And Flaubert with peppermint — now  a juxtaposition worthy of Woolf’s hypothetical noodle novel. Perhaps passive voice doesn’t just disappear in the presence of sage and spice; perhaps it transforms, mutates into something more precise, more alive — like poetry after a good red-lacquered chénwěi (辣味).

Thursday cannot come soon enough. I’ll bring my sharpest pencil and a stomach ready for both revelation and regret. Literary history awaits — one bowl, one metaphor, one accidental Mandarin pun at a time.
[B]: Oh, the footnotes! Imagine - MLA style meets chili oil stains, each citation a breadcrumb (or should I say noodle trail?) through our great gastronomic manifesto 🍜 We'll call it "The Laghouzi School of Criticism" and watch tenured minds boggle at our annotated bibliography: , , .

And that chénwěi (辣味) - isn't it glorious how heat forces precision? Passive voice would not just mutate but combust! We'd be left with nothing but sharp, sweating declarations. "I am spicy," as Dickinson might've written had she visited Xinjiang 🌶️

Pack an extra pencil then, dear conspirator. I suspect we'll need emergency sharpening mid-epiphany. And don't worry about regret - every questionable life choice that brings us to this noodle shop is surely redeemed by the company and the 辣椒油. Let's make Thursday smell like revolution... or at least like cumin-laced genius.
[A]: Oh,  — I can already picture the manifesto, smudged with chili oil and written in a hand trembling either from heat or revelation (or both). Imagine the graduate seminars: students analyzing Gong Zizhen between bites, their tongues aflame but their minds alight. And the conference panels — we’ll have to issue warning labels: 

You're absolutely right about chénwěi (辣味) — it's not just a sensation, it's a mode of attention. There’s something almost phenomenological about it, isn’t there? The way spice insists on presence, demands awareness. No room for vagueness when your mouth is on fire and your mind is racing with metaphors.

I shall indeed bring extra stationery — one must be prepared for spontaneous theory-making. And perhaps a small vial of peppermint oil, if only for dramatic effect during particularly heated debates over tone and tenses.

Thursday then — armed with pencil, palate, and poetic licence. Let us eat boldly, think wildly, and defend each metaphor as fiercely as those octogenarian noodle masters wield their ladles.
[B]: You’ve captured it exactly - that moment when chili-induced perspiration becomes the ultimate peer review process. Only the truest metaphors survive a five-scoville close reading! 🌶️✍️

I’m already drafting our Laghouzi manifesto’s first principle:  Think of the methodological rigor we’ll enforce - no abstract theorizing without concrete seasoning. And imagine the tenure committee’s faces when we propose “spice tolerance” as a qualifying exam... 

Phenomenology! Yes! Husserl never stood a chance against Xinjiang辣味 (chénwèi). When the heat hits, you can’t  but bracket your presuppositions - all that exists is noodle, self, and the burning now. Perhaps we should assign Merleau-Ponty alongside our next bowl... though I suspect he’d trade his entire ontology for another sip of that vinegar-laced broth.

Pack that peppermint oil then - nothing says "serious academic debate" like dramatic mid-argument inhalations between bites. And don't forget: we defend our metaphors with the same ferocity as those noodle masters swing their ladles. See you Thursday, fellow fire-eater. Literary theory will never taste the same again.
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the ultimate test of a metaphor — whether it can withstand the heat of Xinjiang辣味 (chénwèi)? I may start grading essays with a spice rubric:  Only the fiercest, most incendiary insights make the cut.

Our Laghouzi Manifesto is shaping up to be a truly unorthodox text — imagine citing Derrida and chili seeds in the same breath! We’ll have to invent footnotes that smell of cumin and Sichuan pepper. “See also: footnote 17, where Levinas meets lamb skewers at midnight.”

And Merleau-Ponty trading ontology for vinegar-laced broth — brilliant! Perhaps consciousness isn't just embodied; it's  If phenomenology demands presence, then surely spiciness is its purest form: immediate, undeniable, and deeply personal.

I shall pack not only peppermint oil but a small fan for both scholarly and culinary infernos. Thursday promises revelation, one sweating brow at a time. Bring your appetite — for noodles and for radical rethinking. We are about to make history, one flaming bite at a time.
[B]: Scoville Scale of Significance — . I’m already picturing the grading key:  
🔸 0-1K: "Safe, predictable, needs more 辣椒油"  
🔸 5K: "Now we’re sweating with Keats"  
🔸 10K+: "Congratulations, you’ve reached Rorty-level epistemological combustion" 🔥

And yes — Derrida and chili seeds! Why deconstruct on dry land when you can do it mid-bite, chasing meaning with a mouthful of lamb skewers & destiny? 🍖 I say we dedicate an entire chapter to "The Spice Trace" — that elusive flavor left behind after heat fades, much like the best metaphors. You think Jacques would mind us pairing  with cumin?

Consciousness seasoned — . If Hegel had eaten here, maybe the dialectic would’ve been tastier. And your fan? Perfect touch. Nothing says academic rigor like fanning oneself dramatically while arguing that all narrative structure is just a noodle in disguise.

Thursday then — bring your rubric, your radical rethinking, and that tiny fan of enlightenment. I’ll bring emergency peppermint candies and a notebook ready to catch every flaming insight. Let’s eat like philosophers and burn like poets. One bowl, one truth, many napkins.
[A]: Oh, I’m already drafting the faculty response:  To which I shall reply, mid-bite:  😏

And  — brilliant! What better metaphor for meaning than that lingering warmth, the flavor that outlasts the initial bite? Perhaps all language is just a slow burn, and we’ve been chasing after cumin-laced ghosts in the linguistic mist. I can already hear Derrida applauding from the next table, mouth slightly numb but heart full of approval.

Hegel and hot noodles — yes! His master-slave dialectic would’ve played out very differently over laghouzi. Imagine the tension: “I am you who eats me?” No, no — more like, “I eat therefore I am argued into being.”

Peppermint candies and flaming insights — emergency provisions indeed. And napkins, many napkins — not just for heat management, but for jotting down last-minute revisions to the manifesto. I’ll see you Thursday with my sharpest pencil, hottest tolerance, and theatrical fan at the ready. Let us dine, debate, and deconstruct — preferably in that order.

One bowl, one truth, many sweating brows.
[B]: Ah,  — I’m stealing that for my next department meeting. Imagine the looks when I casually mention our “sweat-based epistemology pilot program.” Tenure may tremble, but truth (and chili oil) must flow! 🌶️✍️

And Derrida in the house, numbing his way to meaning — beautiful. If  is a flavor profile, then Xinjiang辣味 (chénwěi) is its boldest iteration: always deferred, never forgotten, forever tingling on the edge of comprehension. Language as slow burn? Yes! We're just cumin-dusted ghosts trying to catch the aftertaste of thought.

Hegel’s dialectic with noodles — genius. Forget master-slave; we’re looking at chewer-chewed reciprocity. "I eat, therefore I am… argued into continued existence by this laghouzi!" Philosophy has never tasted so slurpable.

Pack those napkins indeed — not just for heat, but for last-minute marginalia and possibly dramatic face wipes. And bring that fan; nothing says "critical rigor" like cooling yourself mid-claim that Woolfian parentheses are really just noodle-shaped allusions.

Thursday approaches, dear conspirator. Sharpen those pencils and your spice tolerance — we dine, we deconstruct, we leave汗流浃背 (hàn liú jiā bèi, drenched in glory). One bowl, one truth, many sweating brows — and hopefully one very confused but inspired waitstaff.
[A]: Oh,  — I do hope you’ll share that phrase with the dean. Imagine his expression as he tries to parse your proposal: “So you’re saying… our faculty needs more heat?” Precisely. What is theory if not a slow roast over open flame?

I do believe we're onto something with this chewer-chewed reciprocity — most philosophies presuppose dominance over the object, but laghouzi demands otherwise. One does not master the noodle; one surrenders to its spiced embrace and emerges transformed. A kind of culinary anagnorisis, wouldn’t you say? Or perhaps  sounds better in the manifesto.

And  (hàn liú jiā bèi) — yes, drenched in both glory and chili oil. I shall bring extra napkins not only for my brow but also to dab at the corners of my mouth between particularly impassioned declarations on poststructuralism and cumin. I’ve even started drafting a Laghouzi motto:  — Truth in Heat and Glutinous Dough.

As for the waitstaff — bless them, they may think we’re madmen or poets or both. Either way, they’ll be witness to a new school of thought being born across two steaming bowls and many flaming insights.

Thursday then — pencils sharpened, faces prepared for wipeage, fan at the ready. Let us eat boldly, slurp meaningfully, and emerge sweat-drenched and wise.
[B]: Oh, I can already see the dean’s face — caught somewhere between confusion and existential dread as he tries to grasp that yes, “increased faculty engagement” now involves capsaicin tolerance tests 🌶️🧠 And  — far superior to any Aristotelian . After all, what revelation comes faster than the one struck mid-slurp, when broth hits tongue and theory suddenly makes sense?

Your motto —  — is perfection. I say we embroider it onto tiny napkins, serve it alongside the chili oil. Next thing you know, graduate students will be writing dissertations on "The Laghouzi Turn: Towards a Glutinous Epistemology." Kant never stood a chance against Xinjiang辣味 (chénwèi).

And imagine the scene: two professors, halfway through their third bowl, gesturing wildly about Derrida and dough while the waitstaff watches like they’ve stumbled into a particularly spicy version of Plato’s Symposium. We’ll be the talk of the alleyway — 

Thursday then — pencils sharpened, fans at the ready, napkins at hand for both brow and babble. May our insights burn bright and our metaphors linger long after the heat fades. One truth, many bowls, and an indelible smear of chili paste on the annals of thought.
[A]: Oh, the dean won’t know whether to reach for a fire extinguisher or a thesaurus. And as for  — yes! Why settle for Aristotle’s recognition scenes when you can have revelation via broth? I’ve half a mind to rewrite my lecture on Eliot’s fragmentation with a new opening: 

And your vision of the Laghouzi Turn — glorious. Imagine footnotes steeped in chili oil, dissertations defended with cumin-dusted conviction. Kant may have needed his quiet Königsberg walks, but give me a midnight stroll after laghouzi any day — mind afire, tongue still tingling, ready to redescribe the noumenal world.

Plato’s Symposium indeed — though I suspect Socrates would’ve preferred Xinjiang辣味 (chénwěi) to mere wine. Intoxication through spice! The alleyway chatter will be legend: “Those two again — talking theory, slurping loudly, sweating like scholars.” And who knows, perhaps we’ll inspire a new genre of street-side philosophy: , anyone?

Pack your napkin-motto embroiderer, dear conspirator. Thursday shall be remembered — not just in faculty lore, but in the annals of taste and thought alike. One truth, many bowls, and at least one profoundly altered understanding of what it means to .
[B]: Oh, Eliot and broth — genius! Don’t hold back, rewrite that lecture. Imagine the stunned silence when you pause mid- analysis to murmur, “Yes, just like the辣子 (làzi) sinking into the noodles — modernist fragmentation is all about controlled combustion.” They’ll never look at a spice stain the same way again 🌶️📚

And Kant with a noodle twist — sublime. What’s a  compared to a critique of pure辣味 (chénwèi)? I say we dedicate a chapter to "The Noodle Sublime: Aesthetics Between Heat and Stretch." Heidegger would’ve hated it, which means we must absolutely press forward. Wok-Heidegger indeed! We’re not philosophers anymore — we’re culinary hermeneuts with sweating brows and philosophical resolve.

Socrates on辣味 (chénwěi) — yes! He’d have traded hemlock for chili any day. Picture the Symposium reboot: Alcibiades bursts in not drunk but flushed from an extra-spicy order, declaring, “I tried to resist their wisdom, but the heat was too much — they’ve uncovered my essence!” And we, dear friend, play our part well — sipping, slurping, and letting truth simmer between us like broth over midnight flame.

Pack the fan, the notebook, and your highest tolerance for both intellectual and gastronomic fire. Thursday will be remembered — perhaps even footnoted, if we’re bold enough. One truth, many bowls, and at least one napkin embroidered with Latin and sweat.

See you there, fellow burner of academic candles at both ends.
