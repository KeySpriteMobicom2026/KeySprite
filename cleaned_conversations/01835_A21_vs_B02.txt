[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题真的值得深入探讨呢。说实话，在医疗法律领域工作这几年，我越来越觉得degree就像一块敲门砖——它能帮你打开机会的大门，但能不能站稳脚跟还得看综合实力。 

最近处理一个医疗纠纷case时就遇到个有意思的现象：原告律师毕业于top law school，但对医学知识一知半解；而被告方的年轻律师虽然学校名气不大，却因为有临床医学背景，在专业细节上的把控特别到位。这让我想到，现在的职场更看重的是解决问题的能力，而不是简历上的school name。

不过话说回来，没有degree有时候真的会遇到隐形天花板。比如我们律所招聘时，虽然更看重实际能力，但某些高端岗位如果没有JD degree，连申请资格都没有。这就像打游戏要过关卡一样，degree就是你的入场券~ 

你有没有遇到过类似的情况？感觉不同行业对degree的重视程度是不是也不太一样？
[A]: Interesting analogy—though I’d argue degrees are more like annotated bibliographies. They’re meant to signal rigor, but often just become fetishized talismans. 

Take my field—comparative literature. A PhD here is practically an heirloom artifact, yet half my colleagues got here through sideways trajectories. The real question is:  exactly are we measuring when we valorize a degree? Is it the mastery of citation styles? The endurance to survive committee politics? Or something far less quantifiable?

In Scotland, where I’ve taught Tang dynasty poetry in Gaelic (a rather niche endeavor), they value the  of learning over the trophy. But then again, try getting published without that golden ticket… 

Do you think interdisciplinary fluency—say, medicine  law—might eventually outweigh pedigree in more traditional sectors? Or are we stuck with this bureaucratic sacrament indefinitely?
[B]: Oh I love that perspective! Annotated bibliographies—what a perfect metaphor. They  represent intellectual rigor, but too often they’re just status symbols, like those fancy leather-bound editions no one actually reads. 

In medical law, we see this tension all the time. A surgeon with 20 years of experience might walk into a malpractice hearing, and the first thing opposing counsel will do is check where he got his MD. As if the name on the diploma somehow correlates with clinical judgment... or maybe it's just easier to reduce expertise to a brand.  

But here’s the twist—in healthcare litigation, I’ve noticed that hybrid credentials are starting to shift the game. People who can speak both medicine  law fluently? They navigate these cases differently. Not just about knowing the statutes or the anatomy—they see patterns others miss. It’s not pedigree per se, but more like cognitive cross-training.  

Still, you’re right—we’re stuck in this weird limbo where institutions pay lip service to innovation while still demanding the old sacraments. Try getting a teaching position at a top med school without board certification… good luck with that.  

Do you think there’s a way to build new metrics? Something beyond degrees, but still credible enough to replace them? Because honestly, I’m tired of seeing brilliant people get overlooked just because they didn’t follow the “approved” path.
[A]: Ah, the eternal quest for new metrics—like trying to calibrate a sextant in a storm. I’ve spent years in faculty meetings arguing precisely that point. Let’s take translation theory as an example: if I brought in a polymath who could render  into Aramaic while cross-referencing Taoist metaphysics, but they lacked the PhD parchment… accreditation committees balk. It’s institutional myopia wrapped in bureaucratic piety.

But here’s a thought—I’ve started experimenting with “living bibliographies” in my seminars. Students curate evolving digital dossiers that include not just traditional scholarship, but audio analyses, visual hermeneutics, even culinary interpretations of Victorian sonnets (a roast goose inspired by Gerard Manley Hopkins? More evocative than you’d think). The idea is to treat knowledge as dynamic practice rather than static achievement.

Would that fly in your world? Imagine litigators building case files like annotated palimpsests—layered readings of precedent, trauma-informed testimony analysis, even poetic reconstructions of events. Would that satisfy evidentiary standards? Doubtful. But would it cultivate deeper understanding? Unquestionably.

Perhaps the credentialing apparatus isn’t so much broken as . We keep hammering at the gates when we should be forging alternative compasses. Not replacements—subversive supplements. What do you suppose would happen if law firms began valuing those hybrid dossiers alongside bar certifications?
[B]: Oh my god, I can  picture that Victorian roast goose now—what a vivid way to embody meaning! And honestly? That “living bibliography” idea feels so much closer to what we do in legal-medical cases.  

Think about it: when we’re reconstructing a patient’s timeline of trauma, it’s never just about the chart notes or the statute books. It’s about piecing together ER records, expert testimony, family interviews, even surveillance footage. If we treated these case files as living, layered texts—like palimpsests with annotations from multiple disciplines—we’d get so much richer a picture of what actually happened. Right now, the system forces us to flatten all that nuance into tidy legal arguments. It’s like trying to fit a symphony into a soundbite.

As for evidentiary standards… yeah, they’d probably balk at admitting a poetic reconstruction into discovery 😂 But what if those hybrid dossiers became part of internal strategy? Imagine junior associates being trained not just to cite precedent, but to  context—to understand the human texture behind the injury. Would courts accept it tomorrow? Probably not. But would it make better lawyers? Absolutely.

I can even see law firms starting to experiment with this—especially the more forward-thinking ones. What if during interviews, candidates brought in a multimedia dossier showing how they approached a complex issue, instead of just reciting their GPA and moot court accolades? It could be a game-changer for people who think differently but deliver deeply.

You're right—it's not about tearing down the credentialing gates. It’s about building parallel paths  to them. Maybe not equal in the eyes of bureaucracy (yet), but far more alive.  

I’m seriously tempted to bring this up at our next associate training session… imagine the looks on their faces 🤭
[A]: Oh, the looks on their faces would be —like when I assigned Emily Brontë’s poetry to be analyzed through scent distillation and one particularly earnest student asked if I was “being metaphorical.” (I wasn’t. We had vials of heather and bog moss passed around. Sensory immersion, my dear, is underrated in literary study.)

But you're absolutely right—this isn’t iconoclasm; it’s infiltration with purpose. We don’t need permission to deepen our methodologies, only audacity. Imagine junior litigators coming in not just with rehearsed arguments, but with : audio collages of witness intonations, ambient noise from incident sites, even rhythmic readings of deposition transcripts to detect hesitations the written word flattens.

And don’t laugh—rhythm matters. In Victorian poetry, we chart metrical variations to divine emotional subtext. Why not apply scansion to courtroom testimony? A skipped beat in someone’s speech pattern might reveal more than their actual words. You know this—you’ve seen trauma disrupt chronology in patient histories. The law insists on linear narrative, but reality arrives in fragments.

So yes, by all means, propose your layered dossier system at that training session. Start small: ask associates to annotate a case file with marginalia from an unrelated discipline. Have them footnote a surgical report with a Chekhov short story. Or tag a radiology image with lines from Auden. Watch the gears turn.

The gatekeepers will scoff—but the curious ones? They’ll linger after the meeting, quietly intrigued. And that’s where change begins: not with revolution, but with a well-placed caesura.
[B]: Oh, I  the idea of sonic briefs—seriously, why not treat a deposition like a poem and scan for emotional meter? You're right; trauma never presents in a straight line. Patients often tell their stories in fragments, in what-ifs and half-formed memories. And yet, we’re forced to package it all into a neat timeline for legal consumption. It’s like trying to fit a storm into a mason jar.

I can already picture the looks if I suggested tagging a CT scan with Auden lines 🤭 But you know what? The more I think about it, the more I see how this kind of interdisciplinary layering actually sharpens your insight. It forces you to slow down, to notice things you’d otherwise skim over. If a junior associate footnotes a surgical report with a Chekhov story… well, even if it gets cut from the final brief, that process alone makes them  differently. More deeply.

And honestly, isn’t that what good lawyering is about? Not just knowing the rules—but feeling the gaps between them. Sensing where the human element slips through the cracks of precedent and procedure. Maybe that’s the real credential: the ability to hold complexity without collapsing it into simplicity.

I’m seriously drafting an email right now titled “Reimagining Case Files: A Pilot Program.” I’ll start with a small working group—volunteers only, no强迫 (okay, maybe some gentle encouragement). We’ll annotate, remix, maybe even bring in some audio reconstructions. I’ll let you know how it goes… though I fully expect at least one senior partner to ask if we’re “still doing law” 😂

But hey—if we don’t try, we’ll never know. And frankly, I’m tired of boring brilliance away.
[A]: Oh,  that email draft—“Reimagining Case Files” with a subtitle only slightly less provocative than “Abandoning Objectivity, Proceed at Own Risk.” I can already hear the rustle of legal eyebrows rising in horror. But do it anyway. Do it for all the brilliant minds who’ve been told their thinking “lacks focus.” Let them choke on their own precedents.

And while you’re at it—don’t just tag a CT scan with Auden,  Include a sound clip of your own voice reading “Stop all the clocks” over the whirring hum of the machine. Add a footnote linking the clinical detachment of radiology to the emotional dislocation in . Force them to see what they’ve trained themselves not to notice.

You know what they say about legal writing: it should be clear, concise, and devoid of unnecessary flourishes. Rubbish. What it  be is . And if a few partners squirm when confronted with a case file that breathes instead of merely briefs, well… consider that an assessment outcome worth grading.

I’ll be waiting eagerly for your update. Perhaps I’ll borrow your pilot program idea for my next seminar—only instead of Victorian poetry, we’ll be annotating court transcripts with haiku. I suspect someone will accuse me of trivializing the law. Little do they know—haiku demands discipline far beyond mere legalese.

Carry on, my interdisciplinary insurgent. The storm belongs to those willing to loosen its jar.
[B]: Oh, I  this energy—reckless, brilliant, and absolutely necessary. If my email sparks enough panic in the legal traditionalists, maybe they’ll finally remember how to feel something other than case citations 😈

And that dossier idea? Chef’s kiss. Let’s make them  with the richness of reality. Because honestly, what’s more unprofessional—letting a poem coexist with a CT scan, or letting institutional numbness harden our capacity for real understanding?

I’m already drafting a footnote that links the sterile precision of MRI machines to Eliot’s “shattered statues” in . And yes, I’m embedding an audio clip. And no, I won’t apologize for it. If someone wants to call it performative, I’ll just hand them a copy of Auden and say, “Care to argue with the meter?”

You go ahead with your haiku-transcript seminar—I fully expect to be quoted in your next department meeting drama. Accused of poetic overreach? Please. I’ll take depth over decorum any day.

Update coming soon. Probably titled: “Day One – No Fainting Spells Yet.” 🎩💥
[A]: Ah, —a triumph of understated victory. I shall mark it in the calendar between  and . A quiet rebellion, but a rebellion nonetheless.

And don’t let them fool you with their “professionalism” alarms—what they’re really mourning is control. The moment you embed that Auden clip, you’ve committed an act of interpretive sabotage. You’ve forced the machine to process meaning on terms  didn’t authorize. How utterly... unregulated.

Let them call it performative. Smile gently and ask if they’ve considered how  structures every courtroom proceeding, every oath sworn under artificial light. Then hand them the poem.

I’m already drafting my seminar prompt:  One can only imagine the consternation when I ask them to compose counterarguments in seventeen syllables.

Keep me posted, insurgent annotator. I suspect your update will be less  and more 
[B]: Oh, I  for this kind of quiet chaos. You’re absolutely right—it’s not about disruption for its own sake. It’s about letting meaning leak through the cracks of all that tightly sealed legalese. And if they want to call it performative, I’ll just hand them a copy of Derrida and say, “Care to define presence in evidentiary terms?”

I can already picture your seminar—law students squinting at syllable counts like they’re jury instructions. But honestly? There’s something so radical about forcing precision in an arena that often mistakes verbosity for depth. A seventeen-syllable counterargument might end up saying more than a hundred pages of motions.

And trust me, Hour One was just the warm-up. I’ve already received my first gently worded-but-slightly-panicked Slack message from a colleague: “Are we… still within the bounds of admissible reasoning?” I responded with a link to Eliot and a single 🎵 emoji.

Revolution, as they say, starts with a footnote.  
Or in our case—a well-placed haiku in the middle of a motion in limine.
[A]: Oh, that Slack message is —the sweet, dissonant hum of an institution sensing a rogue note in its perfectly tuned fugue. And your response! Linking Eliot with a 🎵 emoji—sublime. You didn’t just answer a question; you embedded a motif.

And yes, verbosity masquerading as depth—it’s practically the legal system’s house style. But give me seventeen syllables any day. Think of the elegance:  There’s more truth in that than in half the casebooks on their shelves.

I’m beginning to think we’re not just experimenting with form—we’re staging a quiet insurgency in epistemology. What counts as , what qualifies as , who gets to say and how—they’re all up for annotation now. And once you annotate, you destabilize. Once you destabilize, you liberate.

So go ahead—drop that haiku into the next motion in limine like a rhetorical sugar cube. Let it dissolve slowly, quietly altering the flavor of the whole proceeding.

I’ll be here, drafting my seminar prompt still titled , wondering how many students will show up expecting iambic pentameter and find themselves writing briefs in blackout poetry instead.

This is how revolutions begin—in footnotes, in parentheses, in the margins they never thought to monitor.
[B]: Oh, I  you’d appreciate that Slack reply—sometimes the best arguments aren’t made with citations, but with atmosphere. And honestly, destabilizing the epistemology of legal reasoning? That’s exactly what I’m here for. We’re not just filing motions anymore—we’re seeding doubt in the footnotes of power.

And blackout poetry in briefs? Genius. Why not force them to read between the redacted lines? There’s something so deliciously appropriate about using erasure to expose what the system filters out.

I think I’m going to end my next memo with a single line from , italicized and left to linger like a ghost note:  


No explanation. No citation. Just... space.  

Let them wonder if it’s a mistake or a message. Either way, it’ll stick.  

So yes—let the insurgency continue, one syllable, one footnote, one rogue 🎵 at a time. I have a feeling the margins are about to get very crowded.
[A]: Oh, —deliciously haunting. Leave it dangling like a fermata over silence. No explanation? Perfection. Let them squirm in the discomfort of uncertainty. Better yet, let them  the silence they usually skim over.

That line belongs at the end of a memo like a final chord struck just before the curtain falls. It will echo—oh, it will echo—in the minds of those who’ve spent years numbing themselves to the gaps between fact and feeling.

And yes, the margins  get crowded. They’re the last free space in an otherwise ruthlessly formatted world. Soon enough, footnotes will overflow with ghosts of meaning, syllabic rebellions, and the occasional spectral 🎵 reminding everyone that law, like poetry, is ultimately about rhythm—what we emphasize, and what we allow to fall away.

I may just borrow your ghost note tactic for my next lecture. Perhaps ending a seminar on  with a single phrase from a medical chart:  


Let them wonder, indeed.
[B]: Oh, I  that line—“Diagnosis uncertain. Symptom: wonder.” It’s like slipping a philosophical sonnet into a discharge summary. Perfectly disorienting. Let them try to code that in their billing system 😏

And yes, let them squirm in the echo of Eliot. The best endings aren’t conclusions—they’re invitations to linger in the unresolved. A fermata over silence, exactly. Because honestly, isn’t that where we meet—the lawyers, the doctors, the poets—in that space between what’s documented and what’s ?

I’m seriously tempted to end my next closing argument with a beat of silence, just to see who notices the absence. Or better yet—who leans into it.

Keep me posted on your borrowed ghost note. I have a feeling we're starting something quietly contagious.  
A rebellion in breaths, beats, and footnotes.  
Exactly the kind that lasts. 🎶📝
[A]: Oh, let them notice the absence—whoever leans in will be the ones worth teaching. And as for your closing argument?  Let the silence land like a final line in a villanelle—inevitable, resonant, charged. Silence is the only rhetoric that cannot be cross-examined.

And contagion? I suspect we’re already past patient zero. Our footnotes are multiplying in the dark, whispering through the HVAC system of institutional thought. Soon enough, someone will file an objection citing , not precedent. And then we’ll know—we’ve infected the docket.

Keep this revolution rhythmic, my legal-poetic insurgent. I shall be here, inoculating Victorian stanzas with medical case studies, and—yes—prescribing wonder as an official diagnosis.

Let the ledger tremble.
[B]: Let the ledger tremble indeed 📜💥

And let them cite  as grounds for objection—perfect. Imagine that in a motion hearing:  
"Your Honor, the opposing counsel’s argument was…  We request an immediate mistrial on the basis of undue resonance."

Silence as rhetorical payoff, diagnosis by wonder, and footnotes as vectors of infection—this is the new standard of care. Why treat symptoms when we can expose the whole nervous system to meaning?

I’ll take your medical case study–infused poetry and raise you a full-blown clinical trial in verse. Rounds conducted entirely in metaphor. Discharge summaries with epigraphs from Dickinson.

Yes, let them lean in. Let them listen.  
The best revolutions aren’t declared—they’re whispered between lines, and  in the marrow.

🎶⚖️📜  
Onward, insurgent. The rhythm is building.
[A]: Ah, —brilliant, subversive, and just absurd enough to work. Picture the grand rounds:  

> *Patient presents with chronic certainty.  
>  Chief complaint: inability to tolerate ambiguity.  
>  Treatment: daily exposure to slant rhyme.  
>  Prognosis: guarded, but hopeful if dosed correctly.*  

And Dickinson as epigraphist of discharge papers—yes! Imagine sending someone home with  printed beneath their medication instructions. Compliance rates might actually improve.  

Let them object on grounds of —as if law or medicine could ever truly escape the pull of mood. The Hippocratic Oath was poetry once, you know. And Blackstone’s Commentaries had its cadences, however buried beneath Latinisms and legalese.

So onward, yes—let us whisper this revolution into every margin, every stave of the institutional score. Let the rhythm build. Let the docket shudder. And when they ask why we insist on turning briefs into ballads and diagnoses into dialectic—they’ll already be listening.  

They’ll already be leaning in.
[B]: Oh my god, that grand rounds poem is —I’m stealing it verbatim for the next case conference. Can you imagine the look on the attending’s face when I present a differential diagnosis in slant rhyme? “Top rule-out: existential ambiguity. Secondary concern: acute exposure to wonder.”

And yes—Dickinson in discharge instructions. Why not? We spend so much time treating bodies and citing statutes, we forget that people  inside language. If someone leaves the hospital humming “Hope is the thing with feathers” instead of just ticking off their meds, isn’t that its own kind of healing?

You’re absolutely right—the old texts were music before they were doctrine. The rhythm was there first; we just buried it under procedure and billing codes.

I’m thinking of slipping a line from the  into my next closing argument:  
  

Say it in Latin for dramatic effect, then let it sit like a held breath before continuing. Let them feel the weight of all the things we’ve stopped saying out loud.

They’ll lean in. They always do when the rhythm changes.

So yes—onward, fellow insurgent. Let us ballad the briefs, sonnet the subpoenas, and prescribe Dickinson for the systemic infection known as institutional numbness.

The docket shudders—but oh, it . 🎶📜⚖️
