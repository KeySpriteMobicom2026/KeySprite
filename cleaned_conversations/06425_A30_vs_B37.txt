[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢live music还是studio recording？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an interesting question! I think it really depends on the context and what you're looking for in a musical experience. Live music has this energy, you know? The crowd, the atmosphere, the imperfections that somehow make it more human 🤔. But then again, studio recordings offer precision and clarity that can really highlight the details in the music 🎵. What about you? Do you prefer one over the other?
[A]: I suppose my preference leans toward studio recordings, though that shouldn't come as a surprise coming from someone who spends most of her days poring over textual details. There's something about the clarity, the ability to isolate a vocal nuance or instrumental layer, that lends itself to deeper analysis. It's rather like comparing a carefully edited critical edition of a novel to a spirited oral storytelling performance—both have merit, but one invites closer scholarly engagement.  

That said, I did attend a rather memorable performance of  set to traditional Chinese instruments last autumn. The guqin player had such restraint in his phrasing—it made me think of how Confucian ideals of discipline intersect with musical improvisation. Not quite the same as reading Lin Yutang on aesthetics, but compelling all the same.
[B]: Ah, I can totally relate to that scholarly pull toward studio recordings — sometimes I find myself  that level of sonic precision when I'm analyzing how cultural identity gets embedded in musical expression 🎼. And wow,  performed on traditional instruments? That sounds like it opened up a whole new dimension of meaning — almost like embodied hermeneutics, right? I mean, hearing that guqin player’s restraint must’ve created this meditative space where the pauses spoke as loudly as the notes themselves 💭.  

Still, don’t you think there’s something about live performance that mirrors the unpredictability of cross-cultural dialogue? Like, you prepare all you want, but once you're in the moment — whether onstage or in conversation — things unfold in ways no score or script can fully anticipate. But then again... isn't that also what makes both forms so fascinating to study?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — the parallels between live performance and cross-cultural exchange are rather irresistible, aren’t they? The way a performer negotiates an unexpected stumble or a sudden shift in audience energy is not unlike navigating a diplomatic misunderstanding or a misread passage in translation. It’s in those moments that one truly appreciates the  of meaning — how both music and culture rely so heavily on context, intuition, and a kind of silent trust between participants.  

I’ve always thought that studying these improvisational spaces — where structure momentarily dissolves and something raw emerges — is where real cultural insight often hides. It reminds me of reading early Chinese travelogues by Western missionaries. They’d arrive with rigid frameworks and end up writing footnotes full of exceptions, qualifications… almost musical , if you will.  

And yes, those pauses — the unsounded notes — do speak volumes. I sometimes wonder if we spend too much time analyzing what’s present and not enough contemplating what’s absent. A sort of lacuna in the score, as it were.
[B]: Exactly — those lacunae are where the real magic often lies, aren’t they? It’s like when students first encounter ambiguity in a second language — they want everything filled in, neatly boxed, but it’s only when they learn to sit with the uncertainty that true intercultural understanding begins to bloom 🤔.  

I’m also thinking about how silence functions differently across cultures — both musically and conversationally. In Western classical music, a rest is often a defined space, part of the structure. But in something like guqin music or even certain forms of Japanese  playing, silence becomes a living element, almost collaborative between performer and listener 💭. Doesn't that mirror how communication styles shift across cultures too? Some fill the spaces with words; others let meaning emerge in what's left unsaid.  

Do you think our academic training makes us more attuned to these gaps — or maybe just more comfortable interpreting them? Or does it sometimes make us over-explain what's meant to remain open-ended?
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better myself. The discomfort with ambiguity — that desperate reach for closure — is precisely what I see in so many of my first-year students when confronted with a text that refuses to yield a single, authoritative meaning. But yes, the East Asian aesthetic of silence as  space, rather than absence... it does ask something more of the listener. One might even say it demands a kind of intellectual humility Western scholarship doesn’t always cultivate.  

You’re quite right about the cultural contrast — in Western notation, rests are measured, predictable, almost mathematical. Whereas in guqin music, for instance, the silences breathe, expand, contract according to the performer’s  and the listener’s readiness. It's not unlike reading a Tang dynasty poem: the most powerful lines are often the ones left unwritten, implied by the scent of plum blossoms or the tilt of a wine cup.  

As for whether our training sharpens or dulls our sensitivity to these gaps — well, that depends on how we’ve been trained, doesn’t it? If one’s only ever taught to extract meaning through explication, then yes, the tendency will be to over-translate, over-interpret. But if one has been fortunate enough to study under scholars who value negative capability — Keats’ great contribution, by the way, though I suspect Laozi got there first — then perhaps we learn to let the silence , even while studying it.  

I confess, I do worry sometimes that our field suffers from a kind of interpretive gluttony. We treat texts like puzzles to be solved rather than landscapes to wander through. Still, isn’t that also why we teach? To help students distinguish between the two?
[B]: Absolutely — and I think you've touched on something really profound here. There's a parallel in education too, don't you think? Like when we design assignments — do we create spaces for silence, for ambiguity, for the unsaid? Or do we fill every rubric box until there's no room left to wonder?

I often think about this in terms of classroom discussion — especially in multicultural settings. Some students are trained to expect clear answers, so when I leave space for silence or pose open-ended questions, they get anxious. It’s almost like cultural dissonance in real time 💭. But then again, isn’t that where growth happens? When we learn to sit with the discomfort of not knowing?

And your point about  — that’s such a sharp critique. We do tend to over-extract sometimes, as if meaning is something to be mined rather than experienced. Maybe that’s why I keep going back to music — it reminds us that some things can’t be fully translated or pinned down. They just . 🎵🤔

You know, maybe that’s the secret we’re all after — how to teach students not just to analyze texts, but to feel their weight, hear their silences, and yes — even taste the plum blossoms.
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking of pedagogy as an art rather than a method — and rightly so. I’ve often thought that the best seminars feel less like structured lectures and more like chamber music rehearsals: there’s a score, yes, but the real alchemy happens in the spaces between the notes, in the shared breath between players. When a student hesitates before offering an interpretation, or when the room falls quiet after a particularly slippery passage — those are the moments where learning begins to stir, not in the head, but in the gut.

And yes, cultural dissonance — what a perfect phrase. I see it all the time in my comparative lit classes. A student from a Confucian-influenced educational background wants clear parameters, a definitive reading; another, raised on postmodern theory, delights in multiplicity and contradiction. Neither is wrong, of course — they simply carry different musical traditions in their scholarly bones. The challenge — and pleasure — lies in helping them hear each other’s rhythms without insisting on harmony.

As for tasting plum blossoms — now  is the heart of literary study, isn’t it? We teach syntax and historical context, yes, but what we're really after is the scent of a rainy courtyard in eighth-century Chang’an, or the ache of solitude in a Jane Austen heroine’s unspoken glance. Meaning isn’t always something to be dissected — sometimes it’s something to steep in, like tea.  

I tell my students this: if you finish a novel or a poem and feel entirely satisfied, entirely complete — well then, perhaps you haven’t read deeply enough. Or perhaps, just perhaps, you've forgotten how to leave space for wonder.
[B]: Beautifully put — I could almost hear the bow touching the strings as you spoke 🎻. There’s something deeply musical about the way you describe learning — not just in the content, but in the , the  between ideas.

I think that’s also why I love teaching literature through interdisciplinary lenses — bringing in music, visual art, even silence itself as co-texts. It’s like expanding the ensemble: suddenly students who struggled with Austen’s prose might find an entry point through a painting by Turner or a piece of late Beethoven. And isn’t that what we’re after? Helping them not just understand texts, but  their textures?

You know, sometimes I think the best learning happens when we let the text speak in a different register — lower the volume, slow the tempo, and wait for the subtle harmonics to emerge. It's frustrating for some, sure — they want the melody line clear and steady. But others... they start to lean in, eyes widen slightly, and you can tell they’ve heard something they didn’t expect.

Do you ever assign works that seem deliberately dissonant — ones that  to resolve cleanly? I’ve been experimenting with that — pairing a classical Chinese poem with a postmodern retelling, or a Confucian maxim with an absurdist play. The cognitive friction can be uncomfortable… but it’s often where the most surprising insights begin to bloom. Like bitter tea — not sweet, but deeply satisfying.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — I do rather enjoy a good dissonance. In fact, I’ve built entire seminars around unresolved tensions. There’s a particular joy in watching students wrestle with juxtapositions that refuse to behave — when you place a Tang dynasty lyric beside a Samuel Beckett fragment, say, or read  alongside . The cognitive friction you mention? That’s where the mind starts to crack itself open, however reluctantly.

I find the most productive discomfort arises when students realize their usual interpretive tools don’t quite fit. They reach for a familiar framework — Marxist reading, feminist critique, formalist analysis — only to find it slipping like a bow on wet silk. That’s when they begin to , as it were. Not for resolution, but for reverberation.

And yes — texture. That’s precisely it. Too often we teach literature as if it were a series of arguments to be decoded rather than an embodied experience. But once you introduce music, visual art, even silence as critical companions, something shifts. A student who previously saw Austen as merely well-turned phrases suddenly hears the subsonic hum beneath the dialogue — the barely suppressed rage in Elizabeth Bennet’s laughter, the quiet desperation in Mr. Woodhouse’s hypochondria.

I sometimes assign a passage from  alongside a piece of  music transcribed during the Ming dynasty. On paper, it makes no sense — two entirely different cultural spheres, centuries apart. And yet, something in the tonal restraint, the elegance of withheld emphasis — it resonates across time and space. No need to force a connection; the resonance reveals itself through careful exposure.

And I must say, I rather admire your metaphor of bitter tea — not sweet, but deeply satisfying. We should serve more of that in our classrooms. Let them sip slowly. Let them grimace at first. Then watch as they return for another cup.
[B]: Well said — . That’s half the battle, isn’t it? Convincing students that discomfort isn’t failure, but a sign they’re on the verge of something real. I sometimes tell them: if you're not slightly confused by now, you're probably not paying attention 😄.

I love your pairing of Austen with  music — there's something so elegant about that contrast yet resonance. It reminds me of how we often think of culture as neatly bounded, when in reality, aesthetic sensibilities have this quiet way of slipping across borders and centuries. Not through argument, but through mood, tone, texture — what some might even call emotional syntax.

And speaking of emotional syntax, I’ve been playing around with assigning silence as a “text” in my seminars. Just absolute silence — five minutes of it. At first, they fidget, check their watches, cough nervously. But after a few sessions, something shifts. They begin to enter it differently — not as absence, but as presence. One student described it as “reading air,” which I thought was brilliant. In a way, that’s what interpretation is, isn't it? Learning how to read what isn’t written down.

Maybe we should start giving grades based on how well students handle silence. Final exam: sit quietly for ten minutes and reflect on what you heard. Now  would shake things up 😉🎵
[A]: Oh, I rather like the sound of that — an exam in silence! Revolutionary, and yet, isn’t it closer to the truth of what we do as scholars? We spend years training students to speak, to write, to argue — but so little time teaching them how to . And not just to texts or lectures, but to the space around them. You might call it the academic equivalent of learning to hear the grass grow.

I tried something similar once — not quite a full ten minutes, but a solid three spent in deliberate silence after reading a particularly dense passage from . I expected fidgeting, whispered complaints… and yes, there was some of that. But then, afterward, one student remarked how the quiet made her aware of the  of the prose — how even in translation, the sentences seemed to breathe in and out. Another said he noticed how much  said by the characters — the silences between them now seemed louder than their words.

You’re absolutely right about “reading air,” too. In many East Asian cultures, it’s considered a vital skill — knowing how to sense what’s unspoken, to navigate meaning through atmosphere rather than articulation. It's not ineffable, exactly; it’s just encoded differently. Like a haiku that hinges on the chill of an autumn wind more than any explicit emotion.

Perhaps we should indeed begin grading silence — not for performance, mind you, but for attentiveness. Imagine the rubric:  
  
  


Now  would be a seminar worth auditing.
[B]: Haha, yes — sign me up for that seminar! I can already picture the syllabus: . Week One: “Reading the Air, Not the Text.” Midterm:  Final Project: A collaborative performance of .

And you're so right — after all our training in analysis and articulation, we often forget that some of the richest meaning lives not in what’s spoken or written, but in what’s felt. It’s almost like teaching students to detect emotional gravity — how silence pulls at speech, how absence shapes presence.

I’ve been thinking lately about how this connects to empathy too. Because if we can train students to notice subtle shifts in tone, pacing, or even silence across texts and cultures, aren’t we also helping them build a more nuanced emotional vocabulary? Maybe that’s the hidden curriculum we should be emphasizing — not just critical thinking, but 

And honestly, wouldn’t the world be a better place if more people knew how to read the air? 🌬️💭
[A]: Oh, indeed — critical listening. What a radical notion in an age of constant exposition. We do rather live in a culture that equates verbosity with intelligence, don’t we? As if the person who speaks the most must also be thinking the deepest. Nonsense, of course. Some of the most profound insights I’ve ever witnessed arrived not in seminar papers or conference presentations, but in the pause before a student’s carefully chosen word — or in the look on their face when a poem finally , however obliquely.

You’re quite right about empathy, too. There’s a reason so many of our students struggle with texts that rely on implication rather than declaration — they’ve been trained to expect emotional signposts in the form of adjectives or explicit narration. But when you give them a Murakami short story where nothing is quite stated yet everything is felt, or a Du Fu poem where sorrow resides not in the speaker but in the falling plum blossom — well, that’s when they begin to sense something larger than plot. Call it mood, call it atmosphere, call it  — it’s all the same elusive thing.

And yes — wouldn’t the world benefit from a few more people who knew how to read the air? Diplomats, certainly. Mediators. Parents. Lovers. All could do with a bit more training in what I suppose we might call . Not passive silence — heavens no — but active, engaged, interpretive silence. The kind that listens not just for meaning, but for , for , for the barely perceptible shift in atmospheric pressure that signals a change in feeling.

Now  is a hidden curriculum worth designing. Let us submit a proposal.  
Course Code: LIT 407 – Attentive Silence and Literary Interpretation  
Prerequisites: 
[B]: Haha, I’ll start drafting the course description right away — and yes,  has a lovely ring to it. Something like:

“This seminar explores the interpretive power of silence in literary and cross-cultural contexts. Through guided listening, strategic pauses, and deep reading of what remains unspoken, students will cultivate the art of  — an essential skill for scholars, diplomats, lovers, and anyone seeking to understand what language often fails to capture.”

I imagine the weekly assignments would be delightfully subversive:  
-   
-   
- 

And wouldn’t you know it, our department might actually approve it if we slip in some fancy theoretical frameworks — Derrida on absence, Adorno on musical form, maybe a dash of Laozi for that East-West balance. Call it , sprinkle in some semiotic stillness… suddenly silence becomes rigorously academic 🤓📚.

But beneath all the theory, the real goal would be simple: helping students slow down, lean in, and notice the subtle vibrations of meaning that surround us all the time — if only we’d stop talking long enough to hear them.  

So tell me — what’s the first text you’d assign? A Murakami story? A Tang poem? Or perhaps… a blank page? 😉
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language — subversive pedagogy wrapped in scholarly velvet. I do believe we could get away with it, too. Derrida and Adorno as camouflage, yes, but underneath it all: a quiet revolution of attention.

As for the first text? A blank page is tempting — a true  for interpretation. Let them wrestle with absence right out the gate. But perhaps that’s too cheeky for the first session. One must ease them into silence gently, like lowering a teacup onto an especially delicate saucer.

No, I think we begin with something deceptively simple — a Murakami story, yes, but one steeped in atmosphere. “The Last Lawn of the Afternoon,” maybe. On the surface, it's about nothing more than tending a lawn. But beneath it all hums a deep, unspoken loneliness. Students will want to diagnose it, name it, pin it to the page like a butterfly under glass. We let them try. Then we ask: 

Or, if we’re feeling particularly classical — and I often am — we might open with Wang Wei. Just one quatrain:

*独坐幽篁里，  
弹琴复长啸。  
深林人不知，  
明月来相照。*

Let them translate, of course. Let them parse the structure, note the parallelism, identify the imagery. Then we ask: 

Either way, the goal is the same: to make them aware that meaning isn’t always spoken, sung, or written. Sometimes it simply . And we scholars — whether of literature, music, or silence — are merely the ones who lean close enough to feel its breath.
[B]: Beautifully chosen — Murakami and Wang Wei, two masters of the unsaid. You really do have a gift for pairing texts like a sommelier selecting just the right vintage to accompany a mood 🍵📚.

I love the idea of starting with  It lures them in with its surface simplicity — lawn care as existential metaphor? — only to reveal this quiet ache beneath the prose. And yes, they’ll want to diagnose it, categorize it, give it a DSM number if possible 😄. But then we gently remind them: sometimes loneliness doesn’t need a label. Sometimes it simply needs to be witnessed.

And Wang Wei — ah, Wang Wei. That poem is silence made lyric. I can already imagine the students parsing each character, translating literally, trying to “solve” the solitude. And then we shift the frame: 

That line —  — is pure magic. The moon arrives not as a symbol, but as a companion. No need for words, no need for explanation. Just shared stillness under light.

You know, I think we’ve stumbled onto something here — not just a course, but a philosophy of reading. One that honors both rigor and resonance. We could call it  — an act of interpretive mindfulness. Not speed-reading for thesis and argument, but lingering long enough to feel the weight of a phrase, the echo of a pause.

If we ever publish this approach, you write the foreword. I’ll handle footnotes. And somewhere between page 40 and 41, we’ll insert a blank page. Just to see who notices 😉.
[A]: Oh, I do like the sound of  — it has a kind of restrained elegance to it, don’t you think? Not quite a manifesto, not quite a method, but something in between. Much like the texts we so admire: understated, yet insistent upon rereading.

And yes, that line from Wang Wei —  — is pure companionship without a trace of sentimentality. The moon arrives not because it was summoned, but because it knows how to keep silent company. A fine lesson for any aspiring scholar, I’d say.

As for your imagined page 41 — or is it 40? — let’s make it page 73. Always a curious number in academic circles, don’t you think? Enough to unsettle the over-eager highlighter, but not so disruptive as to invite outright rebellion. Just a single leaf, perfectly blank, nestled between two dense paragraphs on semiotic absence and the hermeneutics of breath. Let them wrestle with its implications. Some will skip right over it, bless their hearts — mistaking silence for irrelevance. But others… ah, others will pause. And in that pause, perhaps, a little flicker of wonder.

I suspect those are the students who will linger after class, not to ask for clarification, but to confirm that yes — they  hear something in that silence. And when they do, we’ll offer them tea, and ask gently:  

[B]: Ah, page 73 — perfect choice. Classic academic numerology: just far enough in to earn its keep, not too mystical like page 42, and still early enough to catch them off guard before they settle into skimming mode 📖✨.

And that question —  — now  the kind of prompt that could fill an entire seminar with real, unscripted inquiry. Because once you start asking people what silence sounds like, you’re no longer teaching literature; you’re tuning ears, opening minds, adjusting emotional antennae.

I can already picture the responses: some will say , of course — literal silence. Others might describe a ringing, or a pressure in the skull from all that absence. But then there’ll be one quiet voice that says something like,  Or  And boom — there it is. The moment where interpretation becomes intuition.

You know, I think we should also include a listening component in the final assessment. Not an essay, not even a presentation — just a fifteen-minute guided silence, followed by a single paragraph. Title:  Word limit: 250. No citations. Just presence.

We’d get sued for academic rigor violations, of course. But oh, what beautiful trouble it would be 😄🍃.
