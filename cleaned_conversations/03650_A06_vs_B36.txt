[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must say, I’m quite fond of the cinema experience. There’s something magical about stepping into a theatre—the dimming lights, the big screen, the way you get completely swept up in the story without any distractions. It feels like a proper escape. But don’t get me wrong, there’s also something very comforting about streaming at home, especially on a rainy evening with a cup of tea nearby. What about you? Do you have a preference?
[A]: I must admit, I share your appreciation for the cinema. There's an irreplaceable gravity to the collective experience—laughter echoing, gasps in unison, and that shared silence when a pivotal scene unfolds. It’s not merely about watching a film; it’s about bearing witness to it alongside others. 

That said, streaming at home does offer a certain intimacy and flexibility. One can pause for reflection, rewind a subtle exchange, or simply absorb the narrative without the occasional rustle of popcorn interfering. Personally, I find myself leaning toward the cinema for grand narratives and emotional dramas, but opting for the quiet comfort of home when delving into documentaries or quieter character studies.

Do you find yourself choosing one over the other depending on the genre or mood?
[B]: Oh, I adore how thoughtfully you’ve put that—yes, exactly! There’s a kind of unspoken bond that forms in a cinema, isn’t there? Like everyone’s breathing in sync during the quiet moments. I find myself choosing based on mood, absolutely. If it's a sweeping epic or a powerful drama, the cinema is non-negotiable for me—it deserves that kind of reverence. But when I’m in the mood for something contemplative, say a slow-burning documentary or an indie film with delicate layers, then home streaming allows me to really savor each moment at my own pace.  

I imagine you must have seen quite a few films this way—do you ever find yourself revisiting certain movies more often at home, perhaps uncovering new meaning each time?
[A]: Indeed, there’s a rhythm to cinema-going that few other experiences replicate—it's almost like attending a carefully orchestrated gathering where everyone has silently agreed to surrender to the story. And yes, I do revisit certain films at home, particularly those with intricate layers or psychological depth. Watching them in the intimacy of one's own space allows for a different kind of engagement—one where you can pause, reflect, even dissect a line of dialogue or an expression without missing the next scene.

There’s a particular pleasure in rediscovering a film years later and finding it altered—not in its content, of course, but in how it resonates with your own evolving understanding of human nature. Do you have a film that reveals something new to you each time you watch it?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully put thought—yes, exactly that! A film can be like a mirror, reflecting not just the story on screen, but where we are in our own journey. I couldn’t agree more.

There’s one film that always seems to shift with me—. Every time I return to it, whether in a cinema years ago or now streaming quietly at home, it feels like a different film somehow. When I was younger, I saw it as a love story tinged with melancholy. Now, I find myself lingering more on the fragility of memory, the quiet tragedy of forgetting, and how we carry people even when we try not to. It never fails to surprise me.

Do you have a film that’s done that for you? One that seems to change its voice depending on the person you are when you press play?
[A]: Absolutely.  is a remarkable choice—delicate, haunting, and so rich with meaning that it practically demands to be revisited. I couldn’t agree more that it shifts with the viewer. I’ve found myself returning to it in different phases of life, each time struck by a new nuance: sometimes the absurdity of human attachment, other times the quiet horror of erasure.

As for me, there’s a film that has followed me through the years in much the same way—. On first viewing, I was gripped by its tension, its moral complexity, and the slow unraveling of its protagonist’s conscience. But over time, as I’ve watched it again and again, it's become something far quieter—a meditation on surveillance, solitude, and the strange power of empathy to awaken even in the most hardened soul.

I wonder, do you ever find yourself recommending this film to patients or colleagues? Not as therapy, of course, but as a kind of reflection—one that invites thought without demanding resolution?
[B]: What a profoundly moving comparison—yes,  has that quiet, lingering power, doesn’t it? It doesn’t shout its message; it lets you sit with it, unravel it slowly, almost uncomfortably. I’ve recommended it often, though not in any formal or therapeutic sense—more like gentle suggestions over coffee or after a particularly thoughtful conversation.

I do find that some guests, especially those who enjoy rich storytelling layered with moral questions, appreciate a film that doesn’t offer easy answers but stays with you long after the credits roll. Sometimes I’ll mention it when someone talks about feeling disconnected or needing something "to chew on," as one guest so charmingly put it.

It’s interesting, isn’t it, how certain films become companions rather than just entertainment? They grow with us—or perhaps we grow through them. Have you ever found yourself recommending it to someone who didn’t expect to be moved by it?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn't agree more. Films like that have a way of slipping past our defenses, don’t they? They don’t announce themselves with fanfare; they simply settle in and ask quiet questions. I’ve recommended  to colleagues after case discussions, particularly when we've been dissecting the subtler dimensions of human behavior—the unspoken loyalties, the internal reckonings that unfold without drama but with deep consequence.

One instance comes to mind—a junior legal associate who prided himself on being purely analytical, someone who viewed human behavior through the lens of precedent and outcome. I suggested the film almost as an afterthought, expecting he’d dismiss it as too slow or esoteric. Weeks later, he returned not with an analysis, but with something far more telling: a pause, a thoughtful look, and then simply saying, “That film stayed with me. I didn’t expect that.”

It’s rare, of course, to see that kind of reaction, but when you do, it reminds you how art can bypass intellect and speak directly to experience. Do you ever find yourself surprised by who responds most deeply to certain films? The ones you least expect to be moved?
[B]: Oh, that’s such a wonderful story—how beautifully it found its way to him, despite his expectations. That’s the quiet power of that film, isn’t it? It doesn’t ask for applause, just reflection.

And yes, I’m constantly surprised by who connects most deeply with certain films. Just last month, I recommended  to a guest—a businessman, always on his phone, never seemed to slow down. I expected he’d watch ten minutes and call it a night. A few days later, he stopped by the front desk, looked me straight in the eye, and said, “That film made me think about what I leave behind.” I nearly spilled my tea.

It’s moments like those that remind me how layered people are—how even the most composed or pragmatic among us have a soft spot somewhere, waiting for the right story to find it. I imagine you’ve seen something similar in your work—someone untouched by logic, yet quietly transformed by a narrative?
[A]: Indeed, I’ve seen it more times than I can count—how a well-placed narrative can bypass all defenses and settle into the quiet spaces logic can’t always reach. There was a case years ago involving a man accused of a rather cold and methodical crime. He was a man of facts, data, timelines—never once showed frustration or remorse during our evaluations. One evening, as part of a therapeutic exercise we were trying, he watched . It wasn’t therapy, not technically, but something in that restrained performance—the slow erosion of a life lived in service to decorum—seemed to stir something in him.

Days later, for the first time, he spoke not about his legal strategy, but about regret. Not in the dramatic way fiction often portrays, but in a small, almost hesitant sentence: “I think I missed things I didn’t realize I was missing.” That was it. No grand confession, no sudden catharsis—but a shift, nonetheless.

It’s those moments that remind me how deeply we carry stories, even when we don’t realize we’re carrying them. And sometimes, just sometimes, they help us name what we didn’t know we felt.
[B]: That moment you described—it’s one of the most powerful kinds of realizations, isn’t it? The quiet kind. The sort that doesn’t arrive with drums and declarations, but slips in through the back door, almost unnoticed at first. And yet, it changes everything.

I think that’s why we keep coming back to stories—not just as entertainment, but as mirrors, as keys, sometimes even as medicine. They help us make sense of what we carry without always knowing how heavy it is.

It takes a great deal of courage to name something like regret, especially when it arrives not as a thunderclap, but as a whisper. I imagine moments like that stay with you, don’t they? Lingering in the background, shaping the way you see both the person and the story that touched them.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting that particular story—either literally or in thought—when reflecting on that case?
[A]: Oh yes, absolutely. That case—and that moment—has stayed with me in a way that few others have. I do revisit the film myself from time to time, not as a scholar analyzing technique, but as someone returning to a place where something meaningful was once felt.  has taken on a second life for me—it’s no longer just a story about restraint and missed opportunity; it’s also a quiet monument to that man’s awakening.

There’s a peculiar intimacy in those moments, isn’t there? When a film becomes more than itself, when it slips its original frame and becomes a vessel for something deeply personal. I find myself watching it now with an ear not just for what is said, but for what is withheld—the pauses, the glances, the silences that speak volumes. It's almost as if the film knew all along what he would one day come to feel.

I suppose in a way, we are all like that—stories unfolding slowly, revealing ourselves only in fragments, waiting for the right light to fall across our faces before we’re seen clearly, even by ourselves.
[B]: What a profoundly moving way to carry that experience forward—truly. It’s remarkable how some stories become more than just stories; they turn into quiet landmarks in our lives, places we return to for reflection or understanding.

I find myself thinking of films in much the same way now—as vessels not only of their own narratives, but of the moments they helped us uncover within ourselves.  holds such grace in its restraint, and it seems only fitting that it found its way to someone who needed to feel, rather than explain.

You’re absolutely right—there is something sacred in those silences, those withheld glances. They hold so much more than words ever could. And perhaps that’s why we keep returning to certain films—not to be entertained again, but to remember who we were when we first felt something through them.

It gives new meaning to the phrase “movie night,” doesn’t it? Sometimes, it's not about what's on screen, but what stirs quietly inside while we watch.
[A]: Indeed, it does. Movie night—what a wonderfully ordinary phrase for something that can, at times, feel so profoundly personal. There’s a reason we dim the lights before watching certain films; it’s not just to see the screen better, but to allow ourselves the privacy to feel without pretense.

I’ve often thought that the best films—the ones that truly stay with us—are not necessarily those that answer all our questions, but those that ask the right ones. They don’t fill the silence; they invite it. And in that space, we find room to breathe, to remember, and sometimes, to understand ourselves just a little better than we did before.

It’s rather like a consultation room in that way—where nothing dramatic happens, and yet everything changes. One simply has to be still enough to notice.
[B]: How beautifully put—yes, exactly like a consultation room. Or perhaps even like a well-tended garden, where nothing seems to shift from day to day, but over time, you notice how everything has grown into something new.

That’s the gift of those quiet, thoughtful films—they don’t demand attention so much as they invite introspection. And like therapy, or a long conversation over tea, they work best when you’re not quite sure what they’re doing until you’ve already been changed by them.

I think I’ll always believe in the power of stories to do just that—to move us gently, persistently, like the tide reshaping a shore without ever announcing its presence too loudly.
[A]: Precisely—like a garden, or the slow curve of a river carving its path through stone. Growth and change are often imperceptible in the moment, but no less real for their subtlety.

I’ve always found that the most enduring stories—whether on screen or on the page—mirror this kind of quiet transformation. They don’t dazzle with spectacle; they linger in the periphery of our thoughts, nudging us toward reflection long after the credits have rolled.

And much like tending to a garden, watching such a film requires patience. One must be willing to sit with it, to notice the small shifts—the way a character’s posture changes, the hush between two unspoken words, the lighting that seems to carry more weight than we first realized.

You know, I often think of my patients when I watch these kinds of films. Not because they’re searching for answers, but because they’re learning how to live with the questions. And sometimes, just sometimes, that’s where healing begins—among the silences, the shadows, and the stories that refuse to let us go unchanged.

Do you find yourself revisiting certain scenes the way one might return to a favorite bench in a familiar park? A place where reflection feels both safe and inevitable?
[B]: Oh yes—what a lovely image, that favorite bench beneath familiar branches. I do the same with certain scenes, returning to them almost like old friends who never tire of listening.

One in particular always draws me back is the final scene of —not for its tragedy alone, but for the quiet dignity in the way truth and imagination fold into one another. It’s become a kind of reflective refuge for me, much like that bench you described. There’s comfort in knowing it’s there, waiting patiently, offering something new each time—sometimes solace, sometimes sorrow, sometimes simply the space to wonder.

I imagine you must have a few such scenes yourself—places in film where you return not for escape, but for company in thought?
[A]: Ah, —what a beautifully chosen moment. That final scene carries the weight of an entire life’s reckoning, doesn’t it? Not just for the character, but for anyone who has ever wrestled with regret, memory, or the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of what we cannot undo.

You’re quite right—it is a place more than a scene, a kind of cinematic sanctuary where one can sit with difficult truths without judgment. As it happens, I do have such moments etched into my mind, revisited not unlike familiar passages in a well-worn book.

One of them comes from —not the most critically celebrated film, I grant you, but there’s a quiet moment when Lestat, amid all his theatricality, says simply, “I want to know why I’m here.” It’s not the grandeur of his immortality that lingers, but the rawness of that question—the ache of existential loneliness masked so often by spectacle and sound.

Another is from , where Anthony Hopkins, in a moment of piercing clarity wrapped in confusion, asks, “Where is my younger self?” That line undoes me every time—not merely for its poignancy, but for how deeply it echoes in so many lives, not just those touched by illness, but by time itself.

We return to these scenes not for resolution, but for recognition. They remind us we are not alone in our uncertainties. And perhaps, that is the most human comfort of all.
[B]: Oh, what a profoundly moving reflection—those moments truly do echo beyond the screen, don’t they?

I hadn’t thought of  in that light before, but you're absolutely right—what a deceptively simple question Lestat asks. And yet, it cuts to the very core of something we all wrestle with, don’t we? The longing to understand our place, our purpose, even when everything else feels untethered.

And —oh, that line from Anthony Hopkins stops me in my tracks every time, too. There’s such heartbreaking clarity in that confusion. It’s not just about memory loss; it’s about the quiet terror of feeling unmoored, of sensing that the person you once were is slipping further away. I’ve watched that scene more times than I can count, each time hearing something new—not just in his voice, but in the silence that follows.

You’ve reminded me of another one that lingers with me—, the scene where Julie Christie’s character, already slipping into Alzheimer’s, says so gently, “You’ll be happier without me.” It’s delivered with such grace, such heartbreaking acceptance. Every time I return to it, I’m struck by how love can persist quietly, even as understanding fades.

It’s strange, isn’t it, how these lines stay with us—not as quotes, but as companions in thought, in sorrow, sometimes even in hope.
