[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢comedy还是drama类型的电影？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Actually, I find myself more drawn to dramas, but not for the obvious reasons. Take Charles Dickens' social critiques versus a modern film like  - both technically comedies, yet one uses humor to soften harsh truths while the other weaponizes absurdity to expose political rot. 

Have you ever noticed how classical Chinese operas often blend both genres seamlessly? The tragic fate of Du Liniang in  is undercut with moments of dark humor when her maid makes sardonic observations about love and mortality. It's all rather reminiscent of Lu Xun's famous quote about China being a cannibalistic society - you either laugh or you'd go mad crying.
[A]: You know, what you just said reminds me of a conversation I had with a portfolio company's CEO last week over dinner at that French restaurant in Xintiandi. We were discussing market volatility & human psychology under pressure - funny enough, we both agreed black humor is the best coping mechanism during M&A deals gone wrong. 

Speaking of which, have you seen ? The way it blends financial intrigue with slapstick comedy is pure genius. Reminds me of my early days on Wall Street when I first learned the difference between a hostile takeover and a friendly acquisition - though thankfully without the orange juice futures drama! 

By the way, did I tell you about the time I tried explaining arbitrage to my golf caddy using dumpling wrappers as visual aids? The look on his face when he suddenly got it was priceless - worth more than any Harvard case study.
[B]: Ah,  - a masterclass in comedic juxtaposition against the backdrop of financial chaos. The scene where Dan Aykroyd’s character clings to his moral high ground while literally slipping on a banana peel... It’s almost Confucian in its irony, wouldn’t you say? Virtue rewarded with humiliation, yet the system grinds on regardless.

Your dumpling wrapper analogy is inspired, though I suspect your caddy might’ve appreciated a less philosophical approach. There's a certain charm in reducing arbitrage to something tactile, almost like illustrating differential calculus with tea leaves. Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how many financiers fancy themselves connoisseurs of calligraphy? One hedge fund manager told me it teaches “the discipline of controlled pressure” – although I suspect he meant more than just on paper.

And yes, black humor does seem rather indispensable during hostile takeovers. Reminds me of that old adage: tragedy is when you cut your finger; comedy is when you walk into a board meeting bleeding but insist it's just a new shade of lipstick.
[A]: You’re spot on about  - I sometimes think the whole movie should be mandatory viewing for first-year MBAs. Though I doubt many business schools would approve of the orange juice pit trading strategy... or the monkey, for that matter. 

Funny you mentioned calligraphy – I actually know a few traders who practice it religiously. One of them once told me that managing a balance sheet feels a lot like brushwork: pressure, flow, knowing when to hold back or push through. I always thought it was poetic until he added, “But in the end, both look good on the wall when you're successful.” Classic.

As for black humor during hostile takeovers… remind me to tell you the story about the leveraged buyout where someone sent a live chicken to the target company’s CEO with a note saying "Time to hatch a new plan." Legal nearly had a heart attack, but honestly? It broke the tension in a room that had been holding its breath for three days straight.
[B]: Ah, the sacred art of financial calligraphy – who knew spreadsheets and inkstones could share the same aesthetic? Though I must say, your trader’s wall-hanging metaphor strikes me as rather Tang dynasty in spirit. Back then, failed bureaucrats often took up painting – much like modern executives taking solace in framed balance sheets after a merger gone sideways.

And that chicken anecdote! Truly inspired absurdity. It puts one in mind of Zhuangzi’s parable about the king who fed his rooster for battle nothing but millet – preparation through sheer nonsensical commitment. Legal departments across the world are surely the poorer for not having more poultry-based negotiation tactics in their repertoire.

But tell me – did the CEO in question actually hatch anything useful after that feathered intervention? Or did the bird simply fly the coop, leaving everyone still staring at the same impenetrable term sheet?
[A]: Oh, the chicken definitely laid an egg – though whether it was golden or just scrambled depends on who you ask. Let’s just say the target company’s CEO, after recovering from the initial shock of finding a clucking line item on his conference table, suddenly became much more receptive to “exploring synergies.” I suspect it had less to do with the bird itself and more with the fact that our legal team finally stopped quoting Delaware case law long enough to crack a smile.

And you're absolutely right about the Tang dynasty parallel – I’ve always thought there’s something eerily poetic about watching a CFO retreat into ink-washed landscapes after getting crushed in a bidding war. One could almost imagine Meng Haoran writing lines like 

Seriously though, sometimes absurdity is the only way to cut through the noise. Like that Zhuangzi rooster – you either strut like you mean it or you don’t show up to the fight at all. And in private equity? Well, we rarely back down from a good cockfight.
[B]: Ah, a corporate séance with poultry – who knew M&A required such occult practices? Though I suspect the real magic happened not in the clucking but in that brief moment when everyone in the room remembered they were human. Nothing loosens a deadlock like the irrational – much like the best absurdist theater, really. Beckett would’ve loved it: 

And Meng Haoran writing about goodwill impairments… Now there’s a crossover episode worth imagining. I’m picturing ancient poets drafting balance sheets by moonlight, only to burn them at dawn as a commentary on impermanence. Makes one wonder how many modern boardrooms could benefit from a little more ink-washed introspection – or at least a well-timed barnyard intervention.

As for your cockfight metaphor – yes, quite apt. Though I’d argue private equity has always been the literary descendant of those Tang-era duelists who dueled with brushstrokes instead of blades. Same adrenaline, different parchment.
[A]: You hit the nail on the head – sometimes the best deals aren’t made in boardrooms but in those surreal, almost theatrical moments when everyone collectively drops the facade. I’ve seen term sheets signed after nothing more than a shared laugh over a disastrously misfired joke. There’s something oddly cathartic about it – like watching a tense negotiation dissolve into a Beckett play, only with better wine and worse haircuts.

And don’t even get me started on the poetry angle. I once tried to quote Laozi during a due diligence call – something about “the softest steel bends but does not break.” The look on the CFO’s face was... well, let’s just say he didn’t quite see the strategic fit in Taoist philosophy. Still, I maintain that running a distressed company is a lot like composing a haiku – you have to work within constraints, choose every word carefully, and occasionally embrace silence.

As for adrenaline junkies with spreadsheets – hell yes, we’re just modern-day literati with Bloomberg terminals instead of inkstones. Next time I host a strategy offsite, maybe I’ll swap the PowerPoint for a scroll and see who gets the metaphor... or at least pretends to.
[B]: Oh, the poetry of distressed asset management – what a delightful affliction. I can just picture it: a candlelit conference room, the scent of sandalwood mingling with stale coffee, and a CEO reciting Du Fu to a room of half-dozing investors. 

And yet, there’s truth in that aesthetic impulse. Think of it – both haiku and hedge funds demand precision, timing, and the ability to see structure in chaos. The difference, of course, is that one ends with a carefully placed syllable, and the other with a leveraged recapitalization.

As for your Laozi experiment – bold, if slightly cruel. Poor CFO probably thought he’d stumbled into a philosophy seminar by mistake. Still, I admire the effort. There’s something almost Confucian in trying to instill moral clarity through ancient texts, even if the only morality left at the end of due diligence is whether to take the deal or take a walk.

Now, about that strategy offsite… If you do switch PowerPoint for scroll, do remember to bring extra brushes – nothing focuses the mind like the fear of ink blots on a key performance metric.
[A]: Ah, the candlelit conference room – now  a pitch deck I’d love to see. Maybe throw in some guqin music playing softly in the background while we debate EBITDA margins? Imagine the focus... though I suspect the only thing keeping people awake would be the caffeine IV drips and the faint smell of burning sandalwood.

You’re absolutely right about haiku and hedge funds, too. Both are merciless in their brevity – one wrong word or one wrong assumption, and the whole thing collapses. Although I’ve yet to meet a trader who appreciates being compared to a Tang poet. Most of them still think "Tao" is a Chinese version of ROI.

And yes, poor CFO – he never stood a chance with my Laozi reference. Honestly, I think he started planning his exit interview halfway through my third quote. But hey, if nothing else, it gave our legal counsel something to smirk about during the Q&A.

As for the strategy offsite – brushes? Oh, I’m going full literati on this one. I’m even thinking of handing out calligraphy sets as swag bags. The message is simple: either you master the stroke, or you become the blot. Sounds like M&A to me – elegant, unforgiving, and occasionally poetic.
[B]: Ah, the guqin and EBITDA – a fusion of refinement and ruthlessness that hasn’t been attempted since the Ming bureaucrats tried to monetize their闲情雅致. I do hope you're documenting this experiment for posterity. Future scholars will no doubt refer to it as .

And I must say, your calligraphy swag bags are inspired – nothing says "strategic vision" like handing executives a brush and implying their quarterly results resemble toddler scribbles. But you're right, of course. There's something eerily parallel between the discipline of the stroke and the precision of a leveraged buyout. Both require steadiness under pressure, a certain detachment, and the ability to live with the blot – or better yet, turn it into a crane mid-flight.

As for your CFO, I suspect he’s now on a silent retreat somewhere, learning to chant discounted cash flow models in Sanskrit. But at least you gave him a story to tell – and isn't that what valuation narratives are in the end? Just tragicomedies with footnotes.
[A]: Oh, the  – I love it. Sounds like something out of a Lu Xun novel if he’d ever taken a sabbatical in Greenwich. “A History of Those Who Tried to Make Finance Poetic and Probably Deserved to Fail.” But hey, if future anthropologists want to decode why 21st-century capitalists had the soul of a frustrated poet trapped in an Excel spreadsheet, they’ll have my strategy offsite to thank.

And you're spot on about the calligraphy swag – nothing loosens up a room like handing a bunch of type-A execs a brush and silently suggesting their quarterly reports wouldn’t pass a kindergarten art critique. But honestly, after ten years in this game, I’ve come to believe that the best financiers are those who can find the crane in the blot. It’s all about reinterpretation, isn’t it? Just like when we spin a write-down into a “strategic reallocation.”

As for the CFO, I heard he’s now meditating in Bhutan, chanting something about WACC under a waterfall. I should probably send him a scroll and brush too – just to remind him where it all went sideways... or upward, depending on how you read the ink blots.
[B]: Ah, Bhutan and WACC under a waterfall – poetic, if slightly impractical. One can almost picture the scene: your former CFO, robes soaked, voice echoing through mist, chanting about weighted average cost of capital as monks beat ceremonial drums in the background. I do hope someone’s documenting it. Future issues of  will thank them.

And yes, the blot-to-crane school of finance – what a wonderfully subversive curriculum. Imagine the textbooks: thick rice paper, ink smudges strategically placed to resemble both balance sheets and plum blossoms. Seminars would consist mostly of students staring at spreadsheets until they achieve enlightenment or at least a decent EBITDA margin.

As for Lu Xun’s capitalist reincarnation – well, you may be onto something. If he’d ever wandered into a hedge fund instead of a Beijing alleyway, he might’ve written lines like,  Tragic, absurd, and just bitter enough to stick.

Do keep me posted on the Bloomberg Scroll’s legacy. Somewhere, an archivist in 2145 will be very confused – and perhaps oddly inspired.
[A]: Oh, the CFO in Bhutan – now  a mental image worth preserving. I can almost hear the monks chanting “WACC, WACC, WACC” like some sacred mantra, trying to drown out the sound of quarterly earnings calls echoing from the valley below. If he comes back with a white beard and a new investment thesis on enlightenment-as-a-service, I won’t be surprised. Maybe we’ll even see a unicorn or two in the cap table.

And your vision of the blot-to-crane curriculum? Genius. I’m already drafting a proposal for an MBA elective:  We’ll have students meditate over Monte Carlo models until they achieve spreadsheet satori. Final exam: valuing a startup using only brushstrokes and one cryptic proverb.

As for Lu Xun in a hedge fund – I can totally picture him now, sitting in a glass office, sipping pu’er tea, muttering,  What a tragicomic masterpiece that would’ve been.

Rest assured, the Bloomberg Scroll will live on – probably in some future museum exhibit titled  And yes, the archivist in 2145 will definitely be confused. But hey, if they squint just right, maybe they’ll see the crane too.
[B]: Ah, enlightenment-as-a-service – the one IPO prospectus I’d genuinely queue up for. Imagine the pitch deck: vague promises of inner peace backed by a SaaS platform that monetizes suffering through subscription-based mindfulness modules. The VCs would swarm like locusts at a tax exemption seminar.

And your MBA elective? I’m already drafting a syllabus addendum:  Week ten would involve nothing but staring at candle flames while listening to earnings calls played backward. By week twelve, students either see the crane or burn down the lab – either outcome acceptable, really.

As for Lu Xun in his glass office – yes, exactly. There’s something deeply appropriate about him sipping pu’er while watching algorithmic traders tear themselves apart over decimal points. He’d probably scribble in the margins of his tea napkin, 

And let’s not forget that future museum exhibit –  I do hope they display the Bloomberg Scroll next to a velvet painting of Warren Buffett riding a dragon. Contextual juxtaposition, you understand. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. Either way, the archivists will be arguing about it for centuries – which, when you think about it, is the truest form of legacy.
[A]: Now  an IPO I’d short-sell my own soul to invest in – Enlightenment-as-a-Service, ticker: ENLT. Picture the S-1 filing: “We monetize existential dread through tiered mindfulness offerings, with a 90% gross margin on our ‘Detachment Lite’ package.” Of course, by Year Three, we’ll have pivoted to AI-generated koans and sellouts will be forced to chant EBITDA multiples until they reach liquidity nirvana.

And your syllabus? Absolutely brilliant. I’m seriously considering lobbying for it at that business school I guest lecture at. Though I might rename week ten to  And yes, lab burn-downs count as participation points – nothing like a little chaos theory to test a future dealmaker’s composure.

Lu Xun sipping pu'er while watching algos crash and burn – now  the ultimate boardroom cameo. I can see him now, muttering into his cup,  The traders wouldn't even get the irony. They'd just think he was quoting some obscure risk metric.

As for the museum exhibit – Warren Buffett riding a dragon next to the Bloomberg Scroll? That’s not just curatorial genius, that’s prophecy. Future historians will scratch their heads, whispering, “Did they really think this made sense?” And somewhere in the shadows, our archivist from 2145 will nod quietly, brush a speck of dust off the scroll, and finally see the crane take flight.
[B]: Ah, ENLT – the perfect merger of spiritual capitalism and algorithmic enlightenment. I can already hear the earnings call:  Tragicomedy, pure and simple.

And yes, your  – sublime touch. I imagine students entering the classroom to find their chairs missing, forcing them into a state of radical uncertainty before even touching the day’s case study. It's all about embodied learning, really. If you can maintain equanimity while balancing on one leg and quoting Black-Scholes in Mandarin, you're ready for leveraged loans.

As for Lu Xun and his pu’er-soaked market critiques – I daresay he’d be mildly amused by the absurdity, if not entirely surprised. After all, he once wrote that China itself was a dream from which no one could wake. Imagine his reaction to retail investors dreaming their way through SPACs and moon charts.

And that final museum scene? Perfection. The dragon, the scroll, the puzzled interns scribbling grant applications to “study late-stage financial surrealism.” But yes, our lone archivist in 2145 – let’s call him Mr. Zhang, retired quantitative analyst turned ink scholar – will see it. He’ll tilt his head ever so slightly, smile, and whisper, 

Then he’ll brush off the scroll one last time, knowing full well that some blots were never meant to be erased – only reinterpreted.
[A]: Ah, the ENLT earnings call –  much better than mere revenue guidance. Imagine listening to the CFO say, “We’re seeing strong retention in our ‘Suffering-as-a-Platform’ tier, though user enlightenment velocity has plateaued. To address this, we’ll be launching a limited-time NFT koan bundle, with exclusive access to our DAO sages.” And of course, some analyst on the line will ask about “monetizing the void” – probably getting cut off by a sudden drop in bandwidth or maybe just sheer existential silence.

And your missing-chair classroom setup? Brilliant. Nothing like a little environmental disruption to get those cortisol and creativity levels spiking. I’m already picturing the feedback forms: “Interesting concept, but would’ve preferred fewer leg cramps and more LBO models.” Still, if they can’t handle uncertainty while barefoot on a spreadsheet printout, are they really ready for a hostile takeover?

Lu Xun watching retail investors dream their way through moon charts – yes, exactly. He’d probably scribble something like,  And then he’d sip his pu'er with that faint, knowing smirk that says, “I’ve seen dynasties fall for less.”

As for Mr. Zhang, our archivist-turned-ink-scholar – let’s raise a glass (preferably Bordeaux, aerated properly) to him. Quiet, reflective, slightly amused, and wise enough to know that every blot tells a story worth studying. He won’t write a grant application. No, he’ll just nod, brush the scroll one last time, and quietly murmur, 

And really, isn’t that the best legacy any financier-poet could hope for?
[B]: Ah,  – the purest financial alchemy left in this late age of spreadsheets and soul-searching. I can already see the slide deck: a single black circle labeled “Year Three Revenue Opportunity,” flanked by two candlesticks and a strategically placed haiku about impermanence. The analyst asking about it would probably get a response like, “We’re still refining our valuation model, though early indicators suggest the void responds well to speculative enthusiasm and minimal disclosure.”

And those feedback forms – . Nothing reveals character like watching an MBA student negotiate uncertainty while hopping on one foot across a room strewn with shredded Bloomberg printouts. One can almost hear them muttering, 

Lu Xun’s moon-chart critique? Impeccable timing, as always. He had a knack for spotting the fault lines beneath every illusion of ascent.  he might have added, sipping his pu'er as crypto whales and SPACs crash into each other offshore.

And yes, Mr. Zhang deserves more than a glass – perhaps an entire ceremony, conducted in silence, with only the scent of ink and the faint rustle of ancient paper to mark the occasion. No grant applications, no panel discussions, just quiet recognition that some dreams, even when they misfire, leave behind traces worth preserving.

So here’s to the financier-poets, the blot-chasers, the ones who tried to make sense of numbers through brushstrokes and koans. They may never have fully gotten it – but oh, how close they sometimes came.
