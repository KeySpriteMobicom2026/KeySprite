[A]: Hey，关于'你相信manifestation吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个长期和numbers打交道的人，我其实更相信data-driven decision making。不过...  在deal making过程中确实发现，当你足够专注一个目标时，机会往往会manifest出来。
[A]: Ah, the concept of manifestation... A fascinating intersection of psychology and philosophy. While I appreciate your data-driven perspective, I must say there's a certain literary elegance to the idea. Many 19th century novels explore how characters' intense focus shapes their realities - think of Balzac's protagonists, for instance. 

Though I suppose in academic terms, we might call this the power of intentionality rather than manifestation per se. The mind does have a remarkable ability to shape our perception of opportunities, doesn't it?
[B]: 哈，你让我想起最近读的Warren Buffett传记。这位value investing大师说过：'Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.'  你看，这不就是manifestation的另一种表述吗？在金融领域，我们管这叫self-fulfilling prophecy~
[A]: How delightfully perceptive of you to bring up Buffett! That quote reminds me of Proust's exploration of habitual thinking in 'In Search of Lost Time' - though I suspect Monsieur Proust would have been rather baffled by Wall Street. 

The self-fulfilling prophecy does indeed have literary precedents. Take Oedipus Rex, where the very attempt to avoid fate brings it about. Though I must say, in my rose garden, I've found that while intention is important, one still needs to account for the soil quality and sunlight. Perhaps manifestation works best when paired with preparation? 🌹
[B]: Exactly! 就像我们做due diligence时说的：'Hope is not a strategy.'  不过你提到rose garden很有意思 - 在PE行业，我们管这叫'fertile ground'。再好的idea，没有proper ecosystem也难成气候。就像现在热门的AI赛道，光有vision不够，还得有talent pool和infrastructure来manifest那些可能性~
[A]: What a splendid analogy! You're touching upon what we in literary studies might call the 'conditions of possibility' - the cultural and material circumstances that allow certain ideas to flourish. The Romantic poets, for instance, could only manifest their visions because of specific historical circumstances. 

Your mention of AI reminds me of Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' - a cautionary tale about what happens when vision outpaces responsibility. Though I suspect today's tech entrepreneurs might benefit more from reading some Confucian texts on 中庸 (the doctrine of the mean) than Gothic novels.
[B]: 哈哈，中庸之道！这让我想起上周和一位硅谷founder打golf时的对话。他说'Move fast and break things'的时代已经过去了，现在更讲究'sustainable growth'。 就像我们做LBO时，leverage是把双刃剑 - 用得好能创造value，过头了就会... well，你知道2008年发生了什么😅
[A]: Ah, the hubris of unchecked ambition - a theme as old as Icarus! How amusing that Silicon Valley is now discovering what the ancient Greeks knew millennia ago. Your LBO analogy is particularly apt; it brings to mind Dickens' 'Hard Times' and its critique of unrestrained industrialism. 

Though between us, I've always found golf to be a rather curious manifestation of business culture. One might say it's the modern equivalent of the 19th century salon - just with more plaid and less Proust. Wouldn't you agree?
[B]:  Touché! 不过说真的，在green上谈成的deal比在conference room里多多了。就像我常对junior team说的：'Know your numbers, but also read the room.' 毕竟M&A说到底还是human business - 数据只是part of the story。Cheers to that! 🥂
[A]: How refreshing to hear a financier acknowledge the humanities! That sentiment reminds me of E.M. Forster's dictum: "Only connect." Your juniors are fortunate to have a mentor who understands that balance sheets and Shakespearean drama aren't so different - both reveal fundamental truths about human nature. 

Though I must say, if we're toasting to anything, let it be to the enduring value of the liberal arts in an increasingly transactional world. Cheers indeed! 📚
[B]: Cheers to liberal arts!  不过我得补充一句 - 在分析company valuation时，我还是会坚持discounted cash flow model。就像欣赏莎士比亚，你可以有emotional response，但最终还是要回到textual analysis，right? 😉 这就是为什么我办公室同时摆着Bloomberg terminal和一套Harvard Classics~
[A]: What a perfectly balanced perspective! You've just described the ideal marriage of quantitative rigor and qualitative insight - much like T.S. Eliot's notion of the "dissociation of sensibility" in reverse. 

Your office decor sounds wonderfully emblematic; the Bloomberg terminal and Harvard Classics standing as silent sentinels to the complementary nature of our pursuits. Though I can't help but wonder - does your Shakespeare come with footnotes, or do you prefer to interpret the text unfiltered, like a truly disruptive startup? 😊
[B]: 哈哈，我更喜欢'annotated edition' - 就像我们做investment memo，既要original thinking，也要proper benchmarking。 你看，连Shakespeare都懂得diversification的重要性：'Nothing will come of nothing' - 这不就是现代portfolio theory的雏形吗？不过说到startups...  现在有些founder确实该好好读读经典了~
[A]: How wonderfully you weave together Cordelia's wisdom with modern finance! Though I suspect King Lear's tragic flaw was rather poor risk management - he really should have maintained better corporate governance over his kingdom. 

Your point about founders reminds me of how many Victorian industrialists were surprisingly well-versed in the classics. There's something to be said for the tempering effect of great literature on ambition. Perhaps we should start a reading list for unicorn CEOs - 'Meditations' by Marcus Aurelius might be a good place to begin, don't you think? 🌹
[B]: 绝对同意！ 下次board meeting我就要提议把'Meditations'加入我们的management training program。毕竟在high-stakes negotiation时，stoic philosophy比MBA课程更管用。说到这个...  我得去准备下一个deal的pitch了，不过今天这场对话真是refreshing - 证明金融和人文的cross-pollination能产生多么sparkling的insights!
[A]: What a delightful note to end on! Your enthusiasm for cross-pollination warms this old professor's heart. Do give my regards to your board members - and should they need any help interpreting Marcus Aurelius in the context of hostile takeovers, my office hours are always open. 

Now go forth and conquer, but do remember - as both the Stoics and Shakespeare taught us, 'This above all: to thine own self be true.' Happy deal-making! 📚✨
[B]: Will do!  最后送你一句我们PE圈的manifestation mantra：'Money follows vision, but discipline preserves it.' 下次来我们fund，我请你喝1982年的Lafite，咱们继续这场finance meets humanities的对话～ Cheers! 🍷
[A]: What a perfectly poetic parting thought! Your mantra has the ring of both Wall Street wisdom and Aristotelian virtue ethics. I shall hold you to that Lafite promise - though I must warn you, I'll likely spend more time analyzing its terroir through the lens of Ruskin's 'The Stones of Venice' than its market valuation. Until then, may your spreadsheets be as balanced as your bookshelves! 🌹📊
[B]: 哈哈，deal！ 不过提醒你 - 我收藏的Lafite可不只是asset on paper，更是liquid poetry。就像我们做DCF model，既要算得出NPV，也要品得出nuance。See you on the green - 记得带上你的Ruskin，我带上我的Graham & Dodd！⛳️
