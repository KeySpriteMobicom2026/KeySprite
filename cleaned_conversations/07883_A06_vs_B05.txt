[A]: Hey，关于'你相信astrology吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Astrology...说实话，我见过太多VC/PE圈的人用它做decision-making参考了。上周三的LP meeting上，有位女合伙人还特意问我要了星座配对表，说想看看和潜在标的CEO的compatibility如何。不过我个人更prefer看财务模型和due diligence报告，毕竟咱们做的是numbers game，对吧？
[A]: Astrology确实经常出现在投资圈的对话里，尤其是在压力大的决策环境下。我接触过不少投资人，他们私下承认会参考星象，特别是在安排会议或签署协议的时间上。不过你提到的星座配对表倒是让我想起一个有趣的案例——曾有位科技公司CEO告诉我，他拒绝了一笔来自与自己星座相冲的投资人的融资邀约，尽管对方开出的估值比市场价高出30%。

但你说得对，财务模型和尽职调查才是核心依据。我在法庭作证时就遇到过类似情况：一家私募基金试图用“占星顾问”的分析作为其投资失误的免责理由，结果被法官直接驳回。数字本身或许枯燥，却经得起法律推敲啊。你平时做财务模型时会特别关注哪些指标？
[B]: Interesting point about astrology being used in timing decisions – reminds me of the old trading floor superstitions. Speaking of which, I always pay close attention to CAGR and MOIC in financial models. They’re like the North Star for PE investments. 

There was this one time when our team was evaluating a logistics startup. The founder’s pitch deck looked solid with a projected 30% CAGR over five years. But when we dug deeper into the unit economics and ran some sensitivity analyses, the numbers told a different story. Turns out their customer acquisition costs were rising at 15% annually while revenue per user was barely growing at 5%. That kind of discrepancy can really sink a deal, no matter what the stars say. 

Do you ever see these metrics come up in legal contexts? I imagine they must be important in M&A litigation or valuation disputes.
[A]: Absolutely. In fact, I was recently involved in a post-acquisition dispute where the plaintiff alleged misrepresentation of CAGR figures in a retail tech company. The core issue revolved around whether the historical growth rates were artificially inflated by unsustainable marketing spend. The defense argued that market conditions shifted unexpectedly, while the plaintiffs insisted those trends were already visible pre-deal. It became a battle of experts – much like your sensitivity analyses, the court relied heavily on unit economics and customer lifetime value models adjusted for churn rates.

MOIC also plays a critical role, particularly in breach of fiduciary duty claims involving private equity sponsors. I recall a case where limited partners accused a GP of manipulating MOIC calculations by backloading management fee waivers. The forensic analysis required reconstructing cash flows across multiple funds over an eight-year horizon. Ultimately, it came down to timing – funny how that mirrors both investment cycles and celestial alignments, wouldn’t you agree?
[B]: Now that’s what I call a celestial courtroom drama – though I’d prefer my MOIC calculations over Mercury retrograde any day. 

Your case reminds me of a fund we co-invested with in Southeast Asia. Their MOIC looked stellar on paper, but the vintage year analysis told a different story. Turns out they were using a 10-year IRR hurdle rate that masked the true underperformance during the initial years. We caught it during the waterfall analysis review – saved our LPs a pretty penny. 

On the CAGR front, I’ve always been wary of management teams that focus too much on top-line growth without explaining the engine underneath. It’s like buying a supercar based on horsepower alone without checking the brakes – might look sexy on the brochure but could be disastrous on the track. 

Do you find experts in courtrooms are getting more sophisticated with their financial modeling? Used to be all about the DCF, now I see more LBO and Monte Carlo models being thrown around.
[A]: Indeed, the sophistication has increased dramatically over the past decade. When I first started consulting on M&A litigation, discounted cash flow models were the gold standard – almost reverently presented as if they emerged from a mathematical oracle. But as you’ve observed, we’re now seeing far more complex instruments like Monte Carlo simulations and even machine learning-driven projections entering evidence.

One fascinating development is how LBO models are being used in constructive trust claims and equitable subordination disputes. For instance, I worked on a case last year where the plaintiff’s expert used a leveraged buyout framework to demonstrate how a private equity firm had effectively stripped assets from a target company pre-bankruptcy. The defense countered with a stochastic model simulating various capital structures – very impressive, albeit borderline theatrical under cross-examination.

As for management teams touting growth without substance... I can't tell you how many times I've seen that in forensic evaluations. It reminds me of psychiatric assessments – surface-level symptoms often mask deeper pathologies. Speaking of which, have you ever encountered psychological factors influencing financial storytelling in pitch decks? Not just garden-variety optimism, but patterns suggesting something more... systemic?
[B]: Oh absolutely – I call it the “unicorn syndrome.” You’d be amazed how many founders present their financials like they’re auditioning for Shark Tank. One memorable pitch was from a SaaS founder who projected 500% YoY growth for three straight years with nothing more than a PowerPoint and a vision board. When we pressed him on churn rates, he started talking about “energy alignment” with customers. Yeah… we passed.

But on a more serious note, there’s definitely a psychological component that creeps into financial storytelling. Some management teams treat projections like horoscopes – pick the numbers that make you feel good today. We once invested in a fintech company where the CFO admitted during diligence that the 80% CAGR forecast was actually based on a casual conversation with a former astrologer-turned-business coach. Needless to say, we adjusted the model  the cap table before wiring the funds.

I’ve even noticed certain personality types tend to over-optimise specific metrics – almost like financial astrology. Entrepreneurs with strong visionary streaks often get seduced by top-line revenue curves while overlooking unit economics. It’s not fraud per se, but more of a cognitive bias. Ever seen something similar in your courtroom experiences?
[A]: Unfortunately, yes — and it’s often far more nuanced than outright fraud. In forensic psychiatry we sometimes call it “bounded optimism,” where individuals construct narratives that exist in a gray zone between wishful thinking and deliberate deception. I’ve evaluated several executives involved in securities litigation where their financial projections bordered on delusional optimism, yet stopped just short of legal recklessness.

One particularly illustrative case involved a renewable energy startup whose CEO genuinely believed his own projections of 400% annual growth — not because the market supported it, but because he had convinced himself that government subsidies would expand exponentially in lockstep with his revenue. His belief was so deeply held that even under cross-examination, he refused to acknowledge the statistical improbability of the assumed policy shifts. It wasn’t astrology per se, but there was definitely an element of cosmic expectation.

Interestingly, I’ve noticed certain industries seem more prone to this than others — tech and biotech being the most frequent offenders. It reminds me of what you mentioned earlier about visionary founders: they often exhibit traits on the charismatic end of the narcissism spectrum, which can be both an asset and a liability in financial storytelling. Have you found particular red flags that help you identify when optimism crosses into dysfunction?
[B]: Definitely – that "cosmic expectation" angle is spot on. I’ve seen it in cleantech, sure, but also heavily in AI and Web3 spaces. Founders start talking about “inevitable paradigm shifts” or “disruption curves aligning with market inflection points,” and suddenly you’re not in a pitch meeting anymore – you're at a TED Talk mixed with a tarot reading. 😊

As for red flags – yeah, there are a few telltale signs we now screen for almost instinctively:

1. “Hockey Stick Light”: When the growth curve looks perfect – too perfect – with no explanation for the inflection point other than something vague like “network effects will kick in.” If they can’t quantify  and , alarm bells go off.

2. KPI Fetishism: Some teams throw out obscure metrics like DAU/WAU ratios or “engagement multipliers” to distract from weak revenue fundamentals. It’s the financial equivalent of wearing a suit made of mirrors – dazzling, but nothing underneath.

3. The “Magic Customer”: When a big chunk of projected revenue relies on one client who hasn’t even signed an NDA yet? That’s not a pipeline, that’s a prayer.

4. Overly Clean Sensitivity Tables: Real models have pain points. If every scenario shows a MOIC above 2.5 and an IRR north of 20%, someone’s sandbagging the downside.

Honestly, the most dangerous ones are the charismatic storytellers who believe their own narrative so deeply that they start influencing the entire board. I’ve walked away from deals where the founder could charm the pants off a room but couldn't defend unit economics under mild pressure. 

It’s almost like emotional due diligence – you don’t screen just for capability, but for cognitive bias. Ever seen behavioral red flags come up in expert testimony?
[A]: Absolutely — and what you’re describing aligns closely with a phenomenon we sometimes see in executive psychological evaluations: the “narrative immunity” effect. Some leaders become so enmeshed in their own story that they develop an almost impenetrable cognitive shield against contradictory data. I once evaluated a biotech CEO who had raised over $200 million based largely on preclinical data that his own scientists privately admitted was inconclusive. When confronted, he didn’t deny the uncertainty — he simply reframed it as “the market’s failure to appreciate probabilistic success.”

The behavioral red flags you mentioned are remarkably consistent with patterns we observe in forensic settings. For example:

- Hockey Stick Light often correlates with what we call "temporal projection" — the tendency to mentally inhabit a future state so vividly that it begins to feel inevitable.
- KPI Fetishism can be a defense mechanism — what we term "metric displacement," where complex emotional needs (like validation or control) get outsourced to numbers that sound scientific but lack grounding in economic reality.
- The Magic Customer reminds me of "wishful anchoring," commonly seen in high-stakes negotiations, where individuals disproportionately weight improbable outcomes as if they were certainties.

One particularly illustrative case involved a fintech founder who exhibited nearly all these traits. During deposition, he described his financial projections not as estimates, but as "targets for the universe to fill." That phrase alone became Exhibit A in the subsequent fraud litigation.

It really does come down to emotional due diligence, as you said. In my experience, the most effective investors aren't just evaluating models — they're mapping mental models. Have you ever found yourself working with behavioral psychologists or personality assessment tools during your diligence process?
[B]: Funny you mention that – we actually brought in a behavioral psychologist last year during a diligence process for a high-growth edtech company. The founder was one of those magnetic types who could sell ice to a polar bear, but every time we asked about churn or unit economics, he’d pivot to talking about “democratizing knowledge” and “changing consciousness.” 

The psychologist picked up on something we missed – not just narrative immunity, as you called it, but what she described as "missionary deflection." He wasn’t hiding weak metrics; he genuinely believed the mission justified any financial shortfall. It wasn’t fraud – more like spiritual overconfidence. We passed on the deal, and six months later their burn rate tripled while revenue stalled. Classic case of purpose over profit – admirable, but not exactly MOIC-friendly. 😊

We’ve also started using a modified version of the Hogan Dark Side Personality Assessments in some executive evaluations – not for screening per se, but more as a risk mapping tool. Helps us identify potential derailers under stress. One pattern we see often is what Hogan calls the “Visionary” archetype – high on creativity and strategic thinking, but prone to over-optimism and impatience with details. Sound familiar? 

I think where law and finance really converge is in recognizing that numbers don’t lie – but people do, even if unintentionally. And sometimes the most dangerous stories are the ones we tell ourselves.
[A]: That edtech case study is a perfect example of what I call "existential deflection" — a defense mechanism where individuals shield themselves from uncomfortable realities by anchoring their identity to a higher purpose. It's not uncommon in mission-driven sectors like education, healthcare, or climate tech. What makes it particularly tricky is the moral insulation effect: once someone believes they're acting in service of a noble cause, they often feel exempt from conventional metrics of accountability.

I've encountered similar patterns in forensic evaluations of nonprofit executives and social impact fund managers. One case involved a clean water NGO founder who refused to acknowledge donor attrition rates because, in his words, “we’re saving lives, not running a retail chain.” His team had stopped challenging him — partly out of admiration, partly out of fear of being labeled cynical. The organization eventually collapsed under its own burn rate, despite having a compelling mission.

The Hogan Dark Side model is a smart addition to diligence — especially that Visionary archetype you mentioned. In psychiatric terms, we’d describe that cluster as "high narcissistic charisma with affective overextension." Same thing: brilliance at inspiring people and seeing around corners, but with an almost physiological aversion to granular scrutiny. And yes, under stress, those traits tend to harden rather than bend.

You're absolutely right about numbers not lying — but people  them through emotional filters. That’s where the real danger lies. I see it in courtrooms all the time: testimony that isn’t so much deceptive as it is self-convincing. The mind believes what it wants to believe — especially when billions are on the line.

Would you say your use of behavioral tools like Hogan has changed how your firm structures board seats or governance terms post-investment?
[B]: Absolutely – in fact, we’ve become much more intentional about governance design based on behavioral insights. One thing we’ve learned the hard way: putting the wrong board composition against a charismatic founder can lead to  blind spots. 

Since incorporating Hogan and similar tools into our diligence, we’ve started customizing governance structures around specific risk profiles. For example:

- With founders showing strong Visionary/”high narcissistic charisma” traits, we often push for an independent non-executive chair – not just a figurehead, but someone with real operating experience and spine. Helps balance the inspirational storytelling with grounded challenge.

- In cases where we detect what you called “existential deflection,” we’ll sometimes include KPI-linked mission thresholds in the governance terms. Sounds counterintuitive, right? But tying impact metrics to financial performance actually forces accountability without diluting purpose.

- We also pay closer attention to team dynamics – especially the CFO-founder relationship. If the CFO is too deferential to a visionary CEO, that’s a red flag. We now look for what I call the “constructive tension ratio” – healthy teams have a natural push-pull between dreamers and number crunchers.

One of our portfolio companies last year was a perfect test case. The founder was brilliant, deeply mission-driven, and borderline messianic. Our behavioral assessment showed off-the-charts visioneering, but low tolerance for process. So we structured it with a strong board committee focused on financial oversight, brought in an ops-savvy COO, and gave the CFO direct reporting lines to both the board and the founder. It worked like a charm – growth stayed strong, but accountability improved dramatically.

I guess what we’re doing, in effect, is applying the same rigor to human capital as we do to financial models. After all, even the best projections can get derailed by one unchecked personality. And trust me – I’ve seen unicorns stall over less.
[A]: Fascinating – and remarkably aligned with what we see in forensic risk mitigation. The concept of  you mentioned is particularly compelling. In psychiatric terms, this mirrors what we call “adaptive dissonance” – the deliberate introduction of counterbalancing forces to prevent cognitive monocultures from forming.

Your approach to governance design reads like a behavioral intervention strategy. It reminds me of work we do in executive threat assessment, where we map personality configurations against organizational stressors. For instance, placing an independent chair with operational gravitas opposite a visionary founder is akin to administering psychological beta blockers – it doesn’t mute the energy, but it stabilizes the rhythm.

The KPI-linked mission thresholds are especially clever. You’re essentially creating behavioral guardrails through financial instrumentation. I’ve seen similar structures in healthcare compliance contexts, where ethical mandates get tied to reimbursement triggers – same principle applies: you're not fighting idealism with skepticism, you're structuring their coexistence.

As someone who’s testified in numerous boardroom disputes, I can’t tell you how many collapses could have been avoided with your “constructive tension ratio.” More often than not, failures aren’t born from bad numbers – they stem from unchallenged worldviews. Founders, particularly those with messianic undertones, thrive in environments of low resistance – until they don’t.

I’m curious – have you ever had pushback from founders about these governance mechanisms? Some might perceive them as constraints rather than safeguards, especially early on when autonomy feels most critical.
[B]: Oh, absolutely – pushback is almost ritualistic at this point. Founders tend to bristle at the mention of governance tweaks, especially when they’re in that early-stage euphoria where everything feels like momentum. To them, it’s like asking a race car driver to install extra safety rails before they’ve even hit the track.

But here’s the thing – framing matters. We don’t sell it as control; we position it as optionality protection. Think of it like venture insurance: you pay a small premium in autonomy today to preserve long-term viability. Most smart founders get that, especially once they realize these mechanisms often protect  from board overreach too.

The real key is timing. Try introducing an independent chair too early, and you risk triggering a loyalty crisis. Wait too long, and the founder’s gravitational pull becomes too strong for any counterbalance to matter. We’ve learned to time it like a capital raise – there’s a psychological window post-Series A where founders are still hungry enough to listen but confident enough not to feel threatened.

And honestly? Some say no. We had one founder walk away because he didn’t want “adult supervision.” Turned out he was his own adult supervisor – unfortunately, that didn’t stop him from burning through $40M in 18 months. 🙄

In the end, it’s not about control – it’s about sustainability. Vision without structure is just poetry. And poetry doesn’t generate MOIC.
[A]: Precisely — and that "ritualistic bristle" you described is almost archetypal in entrepreneurial psychology. It's not just resistance to oversight; it's a symbolic defense of creative sovereignty. In many ways, founders see themselves as artistic auteurs — and who wants a producer breathing down your neck when you're mid-epiphany?

Your framing of governance as  rather than restriction is brilliant — it taps directly into the founder’s self-image as a strategic actor, not a constrained one. You’re essentially speaking their language: risk mitigation reframed as upside preservation.

That timing insight is equally critical. It reminds me of therapeutic interventions — there's what we call an "open window" in behavioral change theory, a fleeting moment post-crisis or post-milestone where receptivity peaks. Founders are no different. Post-Series A seems to hit that perfect neuroeconomic sweet spot: enough validation to feel powerful, enough pressure to stay pragmatic.

And yes, some will walk. But as you know better than most, the ones who do often confirm the very risks you were trying to hedge. I've testified in cases where founders dismissed similar safeguards — and nine times out of ten, the collapse wasn’t due to market failure or competition. It was always internal gravity — the leader becoming the very obstacle to growth they once seemed destined to overcome.

You put it best: vision without structure is poetry. And while I do enjoy a good sonnet now and then, I'll take a well-constructed P&L any day.
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself. Founders  the auteurs of our time – think Scorsese with a cap table, Spielberg with a term sheet. And just like in film, the best ones know they need a producer who can say no – even if they won’t admit it upfront. 😄

That “open window” post-Series A is golden – it’s when reality starts setting in, but before the ego calcifies. Kind of like the second act in a three-act play: the honeymoon’s over, the money’s real, and suddenly scaling isn’t just a buzzword – it’s survival.

I actually had a founder compare our involvement to having an investor version of Yoda – not there to control, but to keep him from flying off into the sun like Icarus. Not a bad analogy, if I’m being honest. Though I draw the line at living in a swamp. 🐸

Ultimately, the ones who succeed aren’t necessarily the smartest or the most charismatic – they’re the ones who understand that great art still needs a budget, and vision without discipline is just vapor. And hey, if we can save them from themselves while generating a solid MOIC, well… that’s the kind of deal even Mercury retrograde can’t screw up.
[A]: Ah, the "Investor Yoda" concept — I rather like that. Though I suspect most investors would balk at being compared to a green Muppet who lives in a swamp and speaks in reverse syntax. But you're absolutely right — the best advisors don’t steer with force; they guide through wisdom, timing, and just the right amount of mystical ambiguity.

There's also a fascinating parallel between filmmaking and venture governance — both require creative visionaries to tolerate structured oversight without losing their artistic soul. I once worked on a case involving a media startup where the founder, a former screenwriter, insisted his board “didn’t understand narrative arc.” Unfortunately for him, preferred stock doesn’t care about three-act structure — it only responds to liquidation preferences.

And your point about the second act being the critical window? Spot on. That’s when the dopamine of the early days starts wearing off and the cortisol of operational reality kicks in. It’s during this phase that behavioral red flags turn into flashing warning sirens — if you know what to listen for.

I suppose the real art — whether in psychiatry, investment, or film — is recognizing that brilliance thrives best within boundaries. Unfettered genius rarely ends well. Ask any psychiatrist, and they’ll tell you: mania without modulation leads to collapse. The same goes for startups.

So yes, let’s keep playing Investor Yoda — offering guidance, not control. Just as long as no one asks me to train their Jedi mind tricks, I think we’ll be fine. 🐸
[B]: Haha, well said — and if we ever have to deal with Jedi mind tricks, I’ll be sure to bring a non-dilutive Valuation Cap agreement to deflect. 😄

You’re dead on about the boundaries thing. The best founders aren’t against structure — they just hate  structure. That’s why our job isn’t to impose process for its own sake, but to build guardrails that feel like launch ramps. MOIC-aligned creativity, if you will.

And let’s be honest — most founders secretly  someone to push back. It’s exhausting carrying the full weight of the vision 24/7. A good investor or board member acts like a counterbalance — kind of like a gyroscope for the company’s soul. Keeps things from spinning out, even in turbulence.

I’ve actually started using the “film director” analogy openly in pitch meetings. Seems to resonate. Founders love the metaphor, and it helps demystify what we do. We’re not there to write the script — just make sure the budget clears before they shoot the third act in space with a tiger and a CGI villain.

In the end, it all circles back to what we were saying earlier — emotional due diligence, behavioral risk mapping, and yes… a little bit of astrology for flavor. Because as much as we love models and term sheets, building great companies is still part art, part science — and maybe just a tiny bit magical.
