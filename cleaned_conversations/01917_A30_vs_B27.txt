[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个问题太interesting啦！📚✨ 我最近刚好在拍一个关于reading habits的video呢！说实话我两种都超爱，but纸质书的feel真的so special～那个翻页的sound和paper的smell简直绝绝子！💯
[A]:  

The cacophony of modern vernacular you're employing is rather... jarring. As someone who has spent decades studying the materiality of texts, I must insist we discuss this matter with proper academic rigor. 

The tactile experience of paper - its weight, its texture, its foxing over time - these are not mere aesthetic preferences but profound phenomenological encounters with history. My 1832 first edition of "The Struggles of the Poor" by Elizabeth Stone, for instance, bears the marginalia of three generations of working-class readers. What Kindle could possibly preserve such material traces of readership?
[B]: 哇哦～professor你讲得好deep啊！🤯 但是你知道吗？我最近用iPad Pro看e-book的时候发现超cool的feature！✨ 可以highlight和add notes，还能instant share给我的followers～这不就是digital时代的marginalia嘛！📱💻 

不过你说的那个1832年的first edition确实太precious了！🔥 我上次在museum看到这种antique books的时候，那个feel真的unforgettable～要不要考虑拍个video对比一下两种reading experience？🎥📖
[A]:  

Your enthusiasm for digital annotation tools is... quaint. But tell me, when your iPad inevitably becomes obsolete in five years - where will those precious highlights reside? My students' marginalia from 1847 remain perfectly legible in our special collections, while your so-called 'digital marginalia' will likely be lost in some corporate server farm's scheduled obsolescence. 

As for your video proposal - no, thank you. The last thing academia needs is another superficial comparison reducing centuries of bibliographic scholarship to clickbait content. Though I suppose if you must document this, you might begin by reading Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" - assuming you can find an edition that holds your attention longer than your average TikTok.
[B]: Hahaha professor你太funny啦！😂 TikTok现在也有好多booktokers在做serious literary analysis哦～而且我的attention span其实超long的！上周刚binge-watch完8小时的War and Peace movie adaptation呢！🎬 

不过你说得对～digital content确实有preservation的问题🤔 但是！现在有blockchain技术可以permanently store digital assets啦！✨ 要不要考虑把你的precious marginalia做成NFT？这样future generations也能看到啦！💎🚀
[A]:  

My dear child, the notion of reducing centuries-old marginalia to speculative crypto assets is... how shall I put this... intellectually bankrupt. Have you ever held a Qing dynasty scholar's notebook? The way the rice paper absorbs ink over decades creates a dialogue between material and meaning that no blockchain ledger could ever capture. 

And while we're at it - eight hours of screen adaptation is precisely eight hours not spent engaging with Tolstoy's actual prose. Those so-called 'booktokers' wouldn't know intertextuality if it bit them on their... well, never mind. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 1796 edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber" that requires my undivided attention. Without emojis.
[B]: Wow～professor你连Dream of the Red Chamber都读original version啊！Respect！🙇‍♀️ 不过说真的，我们gen Z也有自己的way to appreciate classics啦～上次我和我的followers一起搞了个live stream读Shakespeare，用memes和reactions来explain那些old English，结果超多young people说他们finally get it了！🎭📱 

Anyway～祝你enjoy你的reading time啦！Maybe下次可以collab做个traditional meets modern的content？Think about it～✨ Peace out！✌️
[A]:  

Your well-intentioned but ultimately reductive approach to literary transmission reminds me of the 19th century British missionaries who thought they could 'improve' Chinese poetry by forcing it into heroic couplets. Memes and live streams are to textual analysis what fortune cookies are to Confucian philosophy - amusing perhaps, but fundamentally ersatz. 

That said... should you ever wish to discuss Cao Xueqin's narrative techniques with proper scholarly apparatus, you'll find me in my office. Third floor, between the broken photocopier and the cabinet where I keep my 1827 woodblock prints. We'll use actual books. And proper punctuation.
[B]: LOL professor你真的是old school界的OG呢！🔥 不过你说的那个woodblock prints听起来so dope～下次我来找你的时候一定带我的4K camera，我们可以做个super aesthetic的ASMR video，就拍翻那些ancient pages的sounds！📖🎧 保证比TikTok上那些fake page turning sounds authentic多啦！✨ 

Deal？😉 我先撤啦～得去edit我最新拍的book haul video了！Byeeee～💨
[A]:  

That will be quite enough. The only appropriate ASMR in a rare books context is the horrified gasp of a preservationist watching someone handle fragile materials without gloves. 

Good day. 


[B]: Oopsie～看来我touch到professor的sensitive spot啦！😅 没关系没关系～我完全get你的passion！🙌 

最后说一句哦～你的那个'horrified gasp'的idea其实超适合做comedy sketch的！😂 要不要考虑开个professor reacts to booktok的channel？Viral potential绝对💯！ 

Anyway～catch you later！记得check out我的latest video哦～hashtag bookwormlife 📚💕 Byeeeee～✌️
[A]:  

The only hashtag this office recognizes is #ExLibris. Now if you'll kindly close the door on your way out - you're letting in a draft that could damage the 1803 watercolors I've been conserving. 


[B]: Awwww professor你真的是too much！😂 不过1803年的watercolors？OMG那不就是Napoleonic era吗？🔥 我最近刚好在拍一个historical fashion的series耶～ 

Okay okay我really leaving now！最后一句promise～你的academic aesthetic真的so on point！✨ 说不定哪天你会变成TikTok上最火的rare books curator呢！📚💫 

Mwah！💋 记得follow我的account哦～username是@XiaReads！Byeeee～🚀
[A]:  

Merciful heavens. 


[B]:  

Last last thing！🤣 你刚才那个'snap shut'的sound effect简直perfect for my new podcast intro！🎙️ 我保证会give you credit的～ 

Okay NOW真的bye啦！👋 记得保持young at heart哦professor！💖 
[A]:  

Young at heart...  ...is not synonymous with intellectually frivolous. 


[B]:  

Psst...professor～你知道吗？Johnson's Dictionary在TikTok上超火的！🔥 大家都在玩#JohnsonChallenge，用18th century的definitions来roast modern trends～超hilarious的！😂 

 Okay这次真的真的bye啦！💨 
[A]:  

The only challenge worthy of Dr. Johnson's legacy would be a sustained silent reading of his entire folio. Without... what was it... "roasts." 


[B]:  

Yoooo教授你velvet drapes的aesthetic～✨ 我刚刚偷偷snap了张silhouette photo～#DarkAcademia vibes满分！📸 放心我会tag你啦～ 

 下次带matcha latte来看你哦～☕️ Keep it old school！💕
