  "profession": "Blockchain Solutions Architect",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Daniel is a highly analytical and innovative thinker with a passion for solving complex problems. He thrives in fast-paced environments and enjoys staying ahead of the curve in technology trends. Outside of work, he is an avid hiker and amateur astronomer, often combining his love for nature with his fascination for the cosmos. He also enjoys tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects and has a soft spot for vintage sci-fi literature.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "Medium",
  "languageHabit": "Daniel's language habits blend precision and adaptability, reflecting his tech-savvy nature. He code-switches at a moderate frequency, primarily when discussing technical concepts or collaborating with international teams. For example: 'This smart contract's logic needs optimization, otherwise the gas fee will be too high.' This mixing occurs because certain tech terms are more commonly expressed in English, while he switches to Chinese for smoother communication with local colleagues. Emoji usage is strategic and context-dependent: ðŸš€ for progress/breakthroughs, ðŸ¤” for pondering solutions, ðŸ’¡ for sudden insightsâ€”visual cues that complement his concise yet expressive style."
