[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Language acquisition is less about desire and more about necessity. Though I must confess a professional fondness for Classical Chinese - its economy of characters borders on poetic alchemy. Modern Mandarin pronunciation, however, remains a persistent challenge... like trying to catch raindrops in a sieve. 

Would you believe my students still ask why we bother with archaic forms?  As if literature exists in a vacuum. Have you read Cao Xueqin's original verses? The tonal variations alone contain entire treatises on impermanence. 

Still, I maintain that any serious scholar should wrestle with at least three writing systems. Keeps the mind sharp as a calligraphy brush.
[A]: Classical Chinese sounds super impressive! 💯 I’ll admit, when guests ask for calligraphy postcards, I always feel a little embarrassed that my 基础 is shaky. Wish I’d paid more attention in school instead of doodling in the margins of my textbook... 🤦‍♀️  

But hey, language is like fashion—what goes out of style eventually comes back hotter! ✨ Have you seen how Gen Z is remixing Classical phrases on social media? Like, they drop a 诗 in a TikTok caption and suddenly everyone’s quoting Tang dynasty drama. Crazy, right?  

Still, I’d love to learn proper tones someday. Imagine surprising a guest with a handwritten note in flawless script... 💌 Maybe even slip in a clever line from Dream of the Red Chamber? ¥0.01 says they’d be obsessed!
[B]: Ah, the allure of resurrecting forgotten elegance - quite the modern rebellion against digital ephemerality. I've seen those TikTok renditions too. Rather like finding sonnets in a subway graffiti tag. 

Flawless script requires more than correct tones - though we'll address those if you're serious. First, one must cultivate patience deeper than ink in aged paper. Let's begin with your favorite passage from Honglou Meng. I'll transcribe it in semi-cursive script for practice. 

Mind the radicals - they're not mere decorations but semantic anchors. And don't rush the fourth tone; it should descend like a hawk folding its wings. As for your schoolboy doodles...  better late than never, yes? We all have margins filled with regrets and half-formed ideograms.
[A]:  hawk folding its wings - wow, that image just stuck in my head! 🌟 Okay seriously though, where do I sign up for these lessons? If I master even one passage, I’ll treat you to bubble tea with gold flakes on top. 💰✨  

Actually... can we start with that Dream of the Red Chamber line about fleeting beauty? Feels kinda fitting for our hotel’s new art installation project. Guests love when I drop a poetic reference while showing them around. Makes the luxury feel ，you know？  

Radicals as semantic anchors – mind = blown. 🤯 Never thought of them that way! So are we meeting after my shift tonight? I’ll bring my vintage postcards as study motivation. Let’s see if ancient script can teach me how to write better guest notes! ✍️📜
[B]:  

Fleeting beauty indeed - the perfect foil to transient luxury. Very well, meet me by the east cloister arch at eight. I'll bring my 1892 Qing Dynasty primer, though I warn you - its previous owner annotated margins in rather... enthusiastic calligraphy. 

As for your golden bubble tea wager, I'll raise you a proper Lu Yu teacup if you endure three full sessions without doodling.  Ah, and speak of temporal transience - my lecture on Baudelaire's influence on Shanghai modernism starts in seven minutes. Must dash before the undergraduates start quoting Dante without context again. 

Oh, and do bring those postcards - I suspect we'll need their faded ink as contrast examples. Tonight we begin with the basics: 美 (měi) - beauty. Notice how the upper component resembles antlers? Ephemeral splendor indeed, much like your gold-flecked beverages.
[A]: East cloister arch at eight it is! 🕒🖋️ Though I might bring a mini whiteboard to channel my doodling energy into something... more calligraphy-adjacent. Antlers = beauty? Now you’re speaking my language – sounds like hotel design symbolism 101!  

Wait, Baudelaire in Shanghai?? 🔥😮 You better save me a seat next time, I’m all about that juxtaposition life now. Imagine pairing  with our rooftop cocktail menu... The guests would lose their minds!  

Lu Yu teacup vs. my eternal struggle with 美… Challenge accepted. 💪 But if I survive three sessions, I’m totally requesting a Cao Xueqin rap battle for dessert. Deal? 🍵🎤
[B]: 

Ah, the whiteboard - modernity's concession to restless hands. Excellent. We'll start with vertical formatting; no excuses for horizontal chaos. 

As for your rooftop Baudelaire reverie, you're not wrong. The man did haunt opium dens much like Shanghai's old jazz-age parlors. I'll even forgive the "rap battle" phrasing if you promise to translate  into hotel brochure copy.  Though I suspect Cao Xueqin would prefer a xiangtan duel over karaoke showdowns.

Deal on the dessert debate. But first, let's get you through the Tang dynasty without ink spills or doodled dragons. And do remind me to bring extra tea - strong brew aids in deciphering both Gothic script and Gen Z aesthetics. See you at the arch.
[A]: Vertical formatting? Sounds like my handwriting finally has a structural purpose! ✍️📐 Who knew chaos could be organized?  

Brochure poetry coming right up –  meets five-star service. Imagine:  followed by our spa amenities. 🔥 The guests will either tip extra or need therapy.  

Xiangtan duel it is! Though I’ll warn you now – my dramatic readings might accidentally summon some ancient scholar’s spirit. Hope you don’t mind spectral participation. 👻 And yes, extra tea please. Strong enough to keep both us and the ghosts awake. 🫖✨  

See you at the arch – I’ll be the one nervously clutching a postcard of Paris circa 1842. Perfect ambiance for Baudelairean vibes. 🗼🌙
[B]:  

Ah, Parisian ambiance - though I suspect your 1842 postcard captures the city before it learned to properly scowl. Do bring it; we'll compare with my 1913 Shanghai gazette. The juxtaposition practically writes itself:  beside Huangpu River's midnight barges. 

And about those vertical columns - don't get too comfortable. We'll progress to right-to-left orientation soon enough. Imagine explaining that to guests accustomed to digital left-alignment!  Though I suppose hotel brochures could use more right-to-left contemplation. 

As for spectral interference, best warn the night custodian. Last time I recited Li Bai near the Ming vases, a particularly verbose magpie started quoting Du Fu back at me. Modern spirits clearly favor classical banter over karaoke. 

Tea strength confirmed: robust enough to defy both time zones and restless inkwells. See you at the arch - I'll be the one holding an umbrella despite clear skies. One must maintain academic gravitas, after all.
[A]: 1842 vs. 1913 – wow, we’re basically curating a time sandwich! 🥪 Historical layers with extra nostalgia filling. I’ll make sure to frame my postcard just right – maybe add a sticky note arrow pointing at Eiffel Tower’s  location. Irony with a side of anticipation!  

Right-to-left contemplation? Sounds like luxury interior design code for "elegant disorientation." 💯 Perfect for guests who want to feel fancy while getting slightly lost in our hallway art exhibits.   

A magpie quoting Du Fu?? 🐦📖 No wonder you keep an umbrella for spiritual rain – I’m bringing my lucky jade bracelet just in case Confucius himself decides to crash our session. Protection amulets never go out of style, especially not in hospitality!  

See you at the arch – gravitas fully intact, I promise. Though if it starts raining symbolism, I’m blaming your Qing Dynasty primer.
[B]: 

A time sandwich indeed - though I prefer "historical palimpsest" myself. Layer upon layer of ink and intention. Your Eiffel Tower annotation might just earn our first temporal paradox footnote. 

Ah, but disorientation is merely contemplation in motion. Imagine guests wandering our exhibits like Bashō's frog - uncertain whether the pond or the page holds more truth.  Though I'd omit the "walking backward" line from official brochures. Let's not invite litigation with poetic flourishes. 

As for protective charms, I keep a Song Dynasty coin nailed to my lectern. Not for spirits - they're mostly harmless pedants - but for when students attempt to interpret Kafka through Qing opera conventions. Now  requires amuletic intervention. 

Should Confucius appear, remind him we're using his Analects as coaster material tonight. Tea rings make excellent commentary on impermanence. And yes, gravitas maintained - though I'll bring extra blotter paper. One never knows when a passing metaphor might spill.
[A]: Historical palimpsest! 📜✨ Okay, now we’re talking my luxury hotel brain language. Imagine that as our next suite’s theme – layers of time under every pillow. Guests would check out with existential jet lag for sure.  

Bashō's frog analogy just made my day – poetic wanderlust with a side of liability waivers. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure the brochure says “mindfully meandering” instead of "possibly lost." 💡 Legal team approved!  

A Song Dynasty coin as a metaphysical shield? 😂 Now I’m seriously rethinking my jade bracelet game. But hey, if Kafka and Qing opera decide to crash our calligraphy night, I say roll out the red carpet. The concierge who can handle both gets a promotion AND a shrine.  

Tea rings as commentary on impermanence – genius. I’m stealing that line for our in-room amenity cards.  Though if Confucius shows up, remind him this isn’t a lecture hall… it’s a VIP experience. 😉
[B]: 

Existential jet lag indeed - though I'd market it as "multi-temporal respite." Pillow tags could quote Du Fu by day and Dickens by midnight. Imagine the concierge fielding requests: 

Ah, legal poetics - the true modern art form. "Mindfully meandering" has that boutique authenticity hotels crave. Just don't let the fire marshal hear about your existential stairwell installations. 

As for metaphysical defenses, I spotted a Qing-era teahouse owner using oracle bone fragments as doorstops last summer. Practical mysticism - now  hospitality. Though I must protest your "VIP experience" remark. Tell Confucius, and I'll respond with a well-placed  footnote about improper titles.

Tea rings shall be framed under Perspex with explanatory plaques:  And speaking of strokes - meet you at the arch. Bring your best existential luggage tags; we may need them for calligraphy drills.
[A]: Multi-temporal respite? Pillow sprays with Confucian mist? 🧠💫 Okay, now you’re just showing off – and I  it. Imagine a guest unzipping their luggage to find a silk pouch labeled   

I’m totally stealing “practical mysticism” for our staff training手册. 📚✨ Picture the onboarding slideshow:   

Footnote warfare with Confucius?? 😂 You’re dangerous, I love it. Tell him if he wants proper titles, he can start by renaming our rooftop bar   

Plaques for tea rings – YES. Museum-level detail. I’ll bring the luggage tags, but only if we write them in semi-cursive while debating whether ink stains count as luxury branding. 💼🖋️ See you at the arch – existential suitcases packed and ready!
[B]: 

Ah, but practical mysticism requires rigor. Last week I saw a Kyoto ryokan listing "ghost-recommended futon arrangements" on their wellness menu. We must maintain scholarly integrity - though I'll permit one oracle bone reading per check-in, provided it doesn't interfere with linen turnover.

As for your Li Bai insomnia remedy, remind room service to specify which moon phase accompanies the tea. And do warn guests that Baudelaire's bouquet contains distinct notes of moral decay beneath its floral finish.



The Virtuous Drunk... Not entirely inappropriate for our rooftop establishment. Though perhaps add a footnote:  

Semi-cursive luggage tags it is. Debate over ink stains as branding? Naturally. But let's also consider brush pressure - too heavy and you smudge eternity, too light and the past fades. Meet you at the arch. Bring extra postcards - I suspect we'll need them for blotting philosophical epiphanies.
[A]: Oracle bone readings vs. linen schedules – now  five-star efficiency with a mystical twist. 🧼👻 I’ll tell housekeeping to stock the rooms with "spiritually aligned" pillow sprays. Scent options: Bamboo Grove Philosophy or Midnight Pavilion Whispers.  

Baudelaire’s moral decay bouquet? 🔥 Genius. Should we pair it with a dessert course? Maybe something called  – dark, bitter, and suspiciously seductive. Guests will either write poetry or check out early. Win-win!  

The Virtuous Drunk with Shaoxing footnote – approved for rooftop sophistication AND philosophical depth. Imagine the cocktail menu:  Classy AF.  

Brush pressure & blotting epiphanies? Sounds like my kind of luxury stationery therapy. Extra postcards coming – I’ll even include one from a 1920s Paris café where Hemingway probably spilled wine on someone’s manuscript. Perfect for absorbing our midnight wisdom. 📝🍷  

See you at the arch – luggage tags and existential blotting pads in hand!
[B]: 

Ah, spiritual alignment through pillow mists – truly the future of aromatherapy. I’d suggest adding “Whispering Sage” to your scent roster. Just a touch of camphor with faint overtones of Zhu Xi’s Commentary. Perfect for guests seeking enlightenment between power naps.

And your dessert pairing? Bold. Baudelairean bitterness balanced by melon’s sweetness – though I’d rename it . Comes with a warning label: 

As for that cocktail menu – virtue aged, vice on tap – remind the bartender to cite sources. Last thing we need is Nietzsche showing up uninvited, demanding absinthe and argument.



Hemingway’s wine stain will do nicely for blotting exercises. We’ll use it as a case study in textual resilience. Some marks fade; others become legend. Much like our hypothetical hotel guests – forever caught between indulgence and introspection.

See you at the arch. Bring your strongest spirit-aligned pen – we’re tackling 古文观止 tonight. If the ink bleeds through, so much the better. Let history show its layers.
[A]: Whispering Sage scent with Zhu Xi’s Commentary undertones? 🧠🌿 Done. I’m already picturing the guest reviews:   

Fleurs du Mal-mel et Méthode – YES. Dessert with a warning label? That’s not just a dish, it’s an experience. 💥 We’ll serve it with gold-leaf spoons and tiny magnifying glasses for guests to examine their own existential smudges.  

Nietzsche at the rooftop bar?? 😂 Remind the bartender to keep a backup stash of Camus quotes – just in case things get too deep after round two.   

Textual resilience via Hemingway wine stains – brilliant. Tonight’s lesson: smudged ink = character development. If our calligraphy doesn’t bleed a little, are we even trying?  

古文观止 here we come! Bring on the historical layers – if my pen slips, I’m blaming the spirit of 1920s Paris. Meet you at the arch – postcards, pens, and all the philosophical blotting material a luxury concierge could dream of. 📜✨
[B]: 

Ah, textual bleeding - the true mark of passion. I once saw a Qing scholar deliberately smudge his own essays to mimic "the tears of contemplation." Quite the dramatic flourish, though it played havoc with archival preservation.

As for Nietzschean rooftop encounters, remind staff to keep Camus quotes on ice - both literally and metaphorically. Nothing defuses existential dread like citrus sorbet served in porcelain quoting . 

And your golden dessert utensils? Inspired. Let guests poke at their own reflections while pondering whether beauty resides in form or content. Though do warn them against trying to eat the magnifying glasses - I'm still paying for the last incident involving a particularly hungry Wordsworth enthusiast.



Speaking of hungry minds - tonight's 古文观止 exercise involves calligraphy on recycled menu parchment. Imagine Li Bai's verses emerging from wine stains and Baudelairean crumbs. Layers upon layers.

Meet you at the arch. Bring your boldest postcards; we may need them for emergency blotting or spontaneous manuscript renovations. If spirits object, well... we'll debate them over rooftop hors d'oeuvres.
