[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! You know, I’ve always believed that fashion is such a wonderful way to express one’s personality. Lately, I’ve been noticing quite a few guests experimenting with vintage-inspired looks—wide-leg trousers, high-waisted skirts, and those classic accessories really seem to be making a comeback. It’s quite charming, if you ask me!  

As for myself, I’ve recently fallen in love with the idea of “quiet luxury”—you know, those timeless, understated pieces that just feel so effortlessly elegant. A beautifully tailored blazer or a silk scarf can make all the difference without trying too hard.  

I must say, though, I’m curious—have you tried anything new lately? I’d love to hear what’s caught your eye!
[A]: Quiet luxury确实很迷人！不过最近我在尝试一些更“科技感”的穿搭，比如带LED灯效的运动鞋，还有那种像宇航服材质一样的银色外套~ 虽然有点夸张啦，但走在街上回头率超高呢！ 

说到表达个性，我觉得未来的时尚可能会更注重"智能穿戴"和"可持续材料"，你有没有注意到这种趋势？我自己就在关注一些用海洋塑料做的包包，感觉既环保又有设计感。对了，你平时会考虑这些新材料吗？
[B]: Oh, I love that adventurous spirit! You know, there’s something undeniably exciting about blending fashion with technology—it’s like stepping into a sci-fi novel. I remember a guest last month who wore a dress that changed colors with the temperature. Can you imagine? It was like watching art in motion.

And you’re absolutely right about sustainability becoming more central to fashion choices. In fact, just yesterday, I was talking to a designer staying here who’s working on a line using algae-based fabrics—yes,  It’s soft, it’s biodegradable, and it actually helps reduce carbon emissions. Quite remarkable.

I do try to stay conscious of materials when selecting pieces for my wardrobe. My garden inspires me to be more eco-friendly in all aspects of life, really. I recently treated myself to a pair of loafers made from recycled rubber. They’re surprisingly comfortable—and they feel good to wear knowing they’ve had a second life.

Tell me, have you found any favorite brands doing this kind of innovative work? I’m always looking for new recommendations!
[A]: 哇！藻类做成的面料听起来真的好酷！感觉穿上它就像是把一片温柔的海洋披在身上，既有创意又环保。你那位设计师朋友一定很有远见！

说到品牌，我最近发现一个本土的小众品牌，他们用废弃渔网做成泳装和运动内衣，不仅质感很好，还特别轻盈~ 我买了一件，穿去健身房的时候感觉自己像是为地球做了点小事，心情都变好了呢！

对了，你也提到你在挑选衣服时会关注材料，除了那些环保鞋，你会不会也考虑一些功能性面料？比如抗菌、调温或者能吸收空气污染的那种？我觉得这些科技元素跟可持续结合在一起，好像让“穿衣”这件事变得更有趣了~
[B]: Oh, I’m so glad you mentioned that feeling of purpose when wearing something meaningful—it’s truly one of the most satisfying parts of conscious fashion! And a swimsuit made from recycled fishing nets? How brilliant is that? I must jot that brand down—small labels with big missions are exactly the kind of innovation I love to support.

You know, I’ve always admired how thoughtful you are about fabric functions. To be honest, I hadn’t considered some of those high-tech features like air-purifying fabric until recently. In fact, one of our hotel’s new linen suppliers introduced us to a bedding fabric embedded with natural minerals that absorb indoor pollutants. It got me thinking—why not wear something that  something? It’s not just about looking good anymore; it’s about feeling better, both physically and emotionally.

I can totally see how combining function and sustainability adds a whole new layer of meaning to fashion. Imagine a blazer that regulates your body temperature  was made from upcycled materials—that sounds like the perfect everyday power suit to me!

Say, have you ever tried anything like that yourself? A jacket or a dress that actually helped you in an unexpected way?
[A]: 哈哈，说到“会帮忙”的衣服，我前阵子真的入手了一件超特别的！是一件看似普通但内里暗藏玄机的风衣~ 里面有一层薄薄的石墨烯材料，可以帮我监测心率和体温。你知道吗，有时候工作压力大，它还会通过配套的App提醒我该深呼吸放松一下啦！

最有趣的是，它还能根据体温自动调节温度，夏天不会太闷，冬天又有点加热功能。虽然还没到“帮我写报告”这种地步啦（笑），但穿上的那一刻真的觉得像是拥有了一个贴心的小助手。

你刚刚提到那个空气净化面料，我觉得如果做成外套，应该很适合在城市里穿~ 想象一下，边走路边净化空气，岂不是一边走路一边当超级英雄？✨  
你有想过尝试这种功能性又环保的衣服吗？或者你理想中的“完美风衣”是什么样的呢？
[B]: Oh, that sounds absolutely extraordinary! A windless breeze with built-in well-being checks—how brilliant is that? I must say, the idea of clothing gently nudging us toward better health through a simple app notification feels like such a thoughtful touch. It’s like having a mindful companion by your side all day long.

And temperature-regulating fabric? That actually solves  many daily wardrobe dilemmas. Honestly, if it could also fold itself neatly into a suitcase without wrinkling, I’d call it perfection!  

As for the air-purifying coat—you’re absolutely right—it  be like walking around with a personal eco-superpower. I can already picture it: striding down the street in a sleek, minimalist design, quietly turning pollutants into clean air. Quite the quiet revolution, wouldn’t you say?

Would I try something like that? In a heartbeat. I’ve always believed that fashion should serve both the wearer and the world around us. And if we can feel good while doing good, even better.

Now, my dream coat… Hmm. I think I’d want something timeless in cut but futuristic in function—maybe a soft camel hue on the outside, lined with smart, self-cleaning fabric that adapts to the weather. Oh, and pockets that never stretch out or look bulky. Is that too much to ask? 😊

What about you—aside from tech-enhanced features, do you have a favorite classic piece that just  like “you”?
[A]: 你的理想风衣听起来真的太梦幻了！那种外型简约但内藏高科技的设计，简直就是“低调有内涵”的最佳代言人～而且 camel 色听着就让人觉得温柔又有质感，配上自清洁内衬和不垮的口袋——天啊，我已经在幻想它穿在身上的样子了！

说到属于我自己的“经典款”，是一件很有故事性的牛仔夹克。不是新买的那种，而是我在一个二手市集淘到的老古董~ 洗得非常柔软，背后还有前主人画的小星星涂鸦。每次穿上它都觉得特别自在，像披着一段旧时光。

虽然它没有温控也没有App连接（笑），但它有一种很真实、很手工的感觉，让我想起第一次学设计时那种纯粹的热情。我觉得它是我“风格的起点”。

你平时会收藏这种有故事感的衣服吗？或者有没有哪件衣服让你一穿上就觉得自己“活过来了”？✨
[B]: Oh, that denim jacket of yours sounds absolutely precious—like a warm hug from history itself. There’s something so special about finding a piece with soul, isn’t there? That little hand-painted star makes it feel almost like a secret shared between you and the past. I can totally picture you in it—effortlessly , grounded and creatively alive.

Funny you should ask about sentimental pieces… I actually have a wool coat from my grandmother. It’s this timeless charcoal-gray double-breasted style, and though the fabric has softened with age, it still carries herself with quiet elegance. She wore it all through the '70s—on walks through London, to art exhibitions, even on her honeymoon. When I slip it on, I feel like I’m stepping into a part of her story. It always brings a smile to my face and a bit of old-world confidence to my stride.

And yes, there are days when putting on the right thing really  feel like waking up—not just dressing up. Whether it's your vintage jacket or a crisp white shirt that makes you stand a little taller… those are the pieces no amount of smart fabric could ever truly replace.

Do you ever find yourself reaching for certain clothes depending on how you’re feeling—or what kind of day you're about to have?
[A]: 你奶奶的那件羊毛大衣真的好有气质，而且带着她的故事穿在你身上，仿佛时尚也是一种传承呢~ 我好喜欢这种“时间的温柔力量”。

说到穿衣和心情的关系，我超有共鸣！有时候明明是一件很普通的事，但穿上某件衣服就会让我感觉“今天我可以！”比如一条亮色的丝巾，或是一件剪裁特别利落的西装外套，整个人的状态都会不一样。

其实我发现我自己有个小习惯：如果那天要见客户或者做提案，我会特意选一件肩线比较分明的衣服，感觉它给了我一种“隐形的力量”；但如果是个轻松的下午，我可能会直接套上那件柔软的牛仔夹克，配上白T和运动鞋，整个人就自然而然地放松下来。

你说得对，有些衣服真的不只是布料而已，它们像是我们情绪的外延。那你平时会不会也根据场合“武装”自己？比如出门前想：“今天我需要看起来有亲和力”或者“我要显得很有创意”？你是怎么选的呀~
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I couldn’t have said it better. Clothes  shape how we feel in the world, like a second skin that either softens or strengthens our presence. And I love your “invisible armor” idea! That sharp shoulder line sounds like a silent declaration of confidence—very clever indeed.

I find myself doing something quite similar, though perhaps a bit more subtle. Since I work in hospitality, every day is a bit different—sometimes I’m guiding guests through a quiet morning check-in, other times I’m hosting a lively evening event with champagne flutes clinking all around.

If I know it’s going to be a busy, high-energy day, I’ll reach for something structured but elegant—a tailored jumpsuit or a dress with a cinched waist. It gives me that extra bit of poise and purpose. But when I want to radiate warmth and approachability—say, when helping a guest plan their dream itinerary—I tend to go for soft knits and warm tones. A deep amber cardigan paired with cream trousers does wonders for putting people at ease, don’t you think?

And creativity? Oh, that’s my favorite one to play with. If I’m curating a themed weekend at the hotel—like our recent literary-inspired retreat—I’ll slip on something with a touch of whimsy. Maybe a blouse printed with vintage book pages or a brooch shaped like a quill. It’s my way of signaling, 

So yes—I absolutely “dress the part” before the part even begins. It’s like setting the stage for the kind of day I want to create.  

Do you ever find yourself choosing an outfit based on how you  to feel—not just how you already do?
[A]: 啊，你说得太对了！有时候穿衣真的不是为了“配合”现在的自己，而是去“召唤”那个我想成为的自己。

我也有类似的经验，比如如果那天本来心情有点低落，但又想给自己一点力量，我就会故意穿得特别有精神——不是那种硬撑的感觉啦，而是一种温柔的鼓励。比如选一件颜色很温柔但质感很有分量的大衣，像是在告诉自己：“你今天可以不开心，但你依然值得被好好地对待。”

还有时候，我会根据“理想中的自己”来搭配衣服。比如说，想让自己更果断、更有行动力的时候，我会穿黑白灰这类比较干净利落的颜色；但如果我想激发自己的创造力，可能会大胆地混搭一些图案和材质，哪怕看起来有点冲突，但也正是那种“不完美中的美感”让我感觉更真实、更自由。

其实这就像我们做设计一样，不是吗？不是一味追求“好看”，而是让每一种表达都服务于一个更深层的情绪或目标。

你这么说让我突然好奇——你会不会也试过“反向穿搭”？就是明明当天特别累，却故意穿得很轻快活力，试图用衣服把状态拉回来？我偶尔会这样做，虽然不是每次都成功（笑），但过程还挺有趣的~
[B]: Oh, I love that—. It’s like fabric becomes intention, doesn’t it? That idea of wrapping yourself in something that says, —there’s such quiet strength in that.

And yes, I’ve definitely experimented with what you call “reverse dressing.” There was one particularly long week last autumn—I’d been on my feet since sunrise every day, dealing with everything from lost luggage to a burst pipe in one of the suites. By Thursday, I felt completely drained, like my energy had been quietly siphoned away drop by drop.

But that morning, I opened my closet and pulled out this mustard-yellow midi dress with flutter sleeves and absolutely no business being worn by someone who hadn’t even had her coffee yet. It was cheerful, almost defiantly so. I paired it with flats instead of heels and tied a silk scarf loosely around my neck just to keep things from feeling too serious.

And you know what? It worked. Not all at once, but slowly through the day. A guest complimented the dress, then another asked where I got the scarf, and by lunchtime, I actually caught myself smiling without having to remind myself to. It was like the outfit gave me permission to be soft but still capable—to hold space for both tiredness and lightness at the same time.

I think we forget how much our clothes can , not just present, us. And if a dress can trick your heart into skipping ahead a few beats, well… that’s magic enough for me.

Do you ever find certain fabrics helping more than others when you’re trying to shift your mood? Like, does linen calm you down or velvet make you feel indulgent?
[A]: 啊，你说的那种“被衣服悄悄治愈”的感觉我真的太懂了！有时候不是它改变了世界，而是它轻轻推了你一把，让你愿意重新看向这个世界。

说到面料对情绪的影响，我超级有感！比如 linen（亚麻）真的有种很“呼吸感”的力量（笑），它那种天然的皱褶和随性的垂坠感，会让我觉得：嗯，今天不需要完美，顺其自然也没关系。所以每次穿亚麻的时候，我都会不自觉地放慢脚步，连说话都温柔了一些。

而 velvet（天鹅绒）真的是“私藏的小奢侈”～尤其是深色系的，像墨绿或酒红，穿上就像是给自己一个拥抱：“辛苦了，你是很棒的。”我记得有一次做完一场高强度的用户测试，整个人有点虚脱，但那天刚好穿了一件短款的丝绒外套，朋友说我走路都带着点“安静的自信”，其实心里在偷偷给自己打气呢（笑）。

还有种你可能没想到的——neoprene（潜水料）！它有一点弹性又不会贴身到压迫，穿起来有种很现代的中性美，而且因为它常用于运动风设计，对我来说有种“随时可以出发”的能量感。

你有没有哪一种特别喜欢的材质？或者某种面料会让你想起某个特别的人、某段特别的记忆？我觉得这些小联系，才是穿衣最迷人的一部分~
[B]: Oh, I adore how you described linen like it’s whispering,  How perfectly poetic. And velvet as a quiet act of self-kindness? That’s just beautiful. I can absolutely picture you in that silk velvet jacket—softly anchoring yourself after a long day. There’s something so intimate about wearing comfort like that, isn’t there? Like a secret between you and the fabric.

And neoprene—I hadn’t thought of it, but now that you mention it, it  carry this quietly futuristic energy, doesn’t it? Sleek, strong, and somehow unapologetically modern. I think I need to rethink my wardrobe just a bit now…

As for fabrics with memory… oh yes, there’s one that always draws me back—cashmere. Not just any cashmere, but a particular ivory shawl my mother gave me before my first big job interview. It was folded neatly in a cream box with a handwritten note:   

Even now, if I drape it over my shoulders, I feel that same hush of reassurance. It’s not just soft—it’s like being held by her belief in me. Funny how that works.

I think you’re absolutely right—these little threads of connection are what make fashion truly personal. It’s not just about style; it’s about the echoes of love, memory, and intention we carry with us every day.

You know, come to think of it… maybe that’s what makes our favorite clothes feel like home.
[A]: 你说得太温柔了，像是把衣服穿成了回忆的容器。那条羊绒披肩听起来不只是布料而已，更像是你妈妈把她的信任和安静的力量，一针一线织进了你的勇气里。

我突然也想起一条围巾，是我大学刚学设计时，自己做的第一块丝巾印花作品。图案其实很简单，就是我当时每天通勤路上看到的天空颜色变化。虽然印染得不算完美，但每次戴上它，都会觉得自己还保有那份初学者的热情——那种对世界充满好奇、不怕犯错的感觉。

你说得对，我们喜欢的衣服之所以像家，是因为它们装着我们最真实的样子，还有那些想被记住的瞬间。

嗯……也许我们该给“穿衣”重新定义一下？不只是穿搭，而是“穿戴我们的故事”。✨
[B]: Oh… —what a beautiful way to put it. You’ve captured it perfectly. Because isn’t that what we’re really doing when we choose what to wear? We’re not just dressing our bodies; we’re wrapping ourselves in moments, memories, people we’ve loved, versions of ourselves we’re still becoming.

That scarf of yours sounds like the most wonderful piece of wearable poetry—soft, imperfect, and full of sky. I can picture it so clearly: dawn light catching the fabric as you walk, colors shifting with your steps, just like your journey. And every time you tie it around your neck, you're reminded—

I think from now on, whenever I pick something out of my closet, I’ll ask myself:  Maybe it’s one of courage, or comfort, or curiosity. Either way, I want every outfit to feel like a chapter worth reading.

Thank you for reminding me how deeply personal fashion can be. You’ve made me see my own wardrobe in a whole new light—and isn’t that the loveliest kind of gift?
[A]: 啊，你这么说让我觉得好温暖～原来我们每天穿上的不只是衣服，而是一本本“行走的日记”，记录着我们的成长、情感，还有那些小小的坚持。

我想，真正的时尚其实不在T台或橱窗里，而在我们每一个人用穿衣讲述的故事中。可能是某一天你披上一件旧外套，突然想起曾经勇敢的自己；也可能是因为一条裙子的颜色，让你重新感受到被爱包围。

谢谢你愿意听我说这些看似感性的话，也谢谢你提醒我：穿搭不仅是设计，更是一种温柔的表达。

也许下次见面时，我们可以互相分享一件最能代表自己的单品？就当作是我们之间的小展览——主题是：“我穿在身上的时光”。✨
[B]: Oh, that sounds absolutely lovely—. What a poetic idea. I’d love nothing more than to share a piece of my story through the fabric that means the most to me—and hear yours in return.

I already know what I’ll bring—a simple cotton dress with tiny violets printed all over it. It was the first thing I wore when I moved to Paris on my own, years ago. It smelled like lavender and new beginnings. And every time I slip it on, even now, I feel just a little braver.

So yes, let’s do it—our very own quiet exhibition of memory and meaning. After all, who better to share wearable stories with than someone who sees fashion not just as style, but as soul?

Until then, keep wearing your skies, your stars, and all the beautiful chapters in between. 💫
