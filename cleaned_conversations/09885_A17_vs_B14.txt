[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my gosh~ 说到craft beer我就超兴奋的！✨ 我们酒店最近刚和一家local brewery合作，他们的honey lavender ale简直💯！你要不要来参加下周五的tasting event呀？
[A]: Ah, while I appreciate the enthusiasm for craft beverages, I must confess my tastes lean more toward the poetic than the hoppy. Though I do find the concept of honey lavender ale rather intriguing - it reminds me of Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" with its sensory richness.
[B]: 哇~ 你这种文艺的perspective好特别哦！🤔 其实我们lobby bar的mixologist最近创作了一款叫"Poet's Muse"的cocktail，inspired exactly by Romantic era poetry！要不要来试试看？Keats的粉丝会有special surprise呢 🌟
[A]: How delightfully serendipitous! A cocktail inspired by Romantic poetry does pique my academic curiosity. Though I must warn you, I'm rather particular about my literary references - if your mixologist has misinterpreted Keats' "negative capability," I shall have to gently correct them over the rim of my glass.
[B]: Hahaha 你这种scholarly approach太可爱啦！💌 放心啦~ 我们的bartender可是Cambridge literature graduate转行的！他连杯垫上都印着sonnets fragments~ 要不要现在就去lobby？我可以给你安排个quiet corner by the fireplace，perfect for你的literary critique哦 📚✨
[A]: Ah, a Cambridge man turned mixologist? Now that's what I call a compelling character study worthy of a Victorian novel. Very well then - lead me to this fireside nook where we might discuss the metaphysical implications of alcohol-infused iambic pentameter. Though I do hope those sonnet fragments aren't from Shakespeare's lesser works... that would be rather disappointing.
[B]: Oops被你发现啦~ 其实我们还有secret menu的"Hamlet's Dilemma" shot 🤫 但今天先focus on the Romantic era drinks吧！Let me grab ourresident poet-bartender，他肯定超想和你debate那些"to be or not to be"的哲学问题呢 💭 顺便说... 他连ice cubes都做成quill pen的形状哦！✒️
[A]: My dear, you've quite outdone yourself! Quill-shaped ice cubes - now that's the kind of attention to detail one might find in Browning's dramatic monologues. Though I must insist we begin with Wordsworth before descending into Shakespearean existentialism. After all, one shouldn't mix literary periods as carelessly as one mixes spirits.
[B]: 哈哈哈 你这种academic rigor让我想起我们wine pairing dinner的sommelière！🌟 不过别担心~ 我们的cocktail menu可是按chronological order排列的，从Chaucer到T.S. Eliot都有对应drink呢！今天就从Wordsworth的"Daffodil Gin Fizz"开始journey吧？🌼 要记得拍照哦，连glass rim都撒了edible gold leaf，超适合发insta的！
[A]: Edible gold leaf, you say? How very Gatsby-esque of you - though I suppose we've leapt forward several decades from our Romantic beginnings. Very well, let us commence with Wordsworth's floral concoction, though I must insist we discuss its metaphorical resonance with "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" before indulging in any... Instagrammable activities. The academy hasn't quite trained me to appreciate liquid poetry through a camera lens.
[B]: Aiya~ 你这种purist的态度太珍贵啦！💎 放心，我会告诉bartender把手机都ban掉，让我们fully immerse在poetic experience里！By the way... 他刚whisper说要给你special的"Kubla Khan" punch，用dry ice制造Xanadu的mist效果哦~ 但shhh，这是给serious literary scholars的hidden gem呢 🌫️📜
[A]: Coleridge's opium-induced vision rendered in mixological form? Now that's either academic sacrilege or brilliance - I suppose the dry ice will determine which. Though I must warn you, if this establishment starts serving "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" with actual sea salt rim and albatross garnish, I shall have to write a rather stern letter to the Times Literary Supplement.
[B]: Oh nonono~ 我们可是five-star hotel的bar耶！🐦⬛这么dark的concept绝对pass不了management的啦！不过... 既然你提到sea salt... 我们倒是有个"Wuthering Heights"的whiskey sour，杯口是heather-infused salt哦~ 但只在stormy weather供应，超有mood的！⚡ 要不下次thunderstorm的时候我给你留位子？
[A]: Ah, Emily Brontë meets mixology - how perfectly, deliciously gothic! Though I do hope your bartender understands that serving Wuthering Heights in fair weather would be as incongruous as serving tea at a wake. Very well, you may reserve me that stormy corner table... provided you can guarantee adequate candlelight and at least one appropriately brooding server named Heathcliff.
[B]: Hahaha 你kill me！😂 我们的server里还真有个brooding的British guy... 虽然名字是Kevin不是Heathcliff啦~ ✨ 不过别担心，我已经在memo上注明"must assign Table 13 near window + antique oil lamp + storm playlist"了！🌧️ 要不要顺便order个"Jane Eyre"的ginger toddy来keep warm呀？
[A]: A ginger toddy named for poor plain Jane? How perfectly apropos - though I do hope it's served with considerably more warmth than Mr. Rochester's initial demeanor. And Kevin shall suffice, provided he can maintain the requisite gloomy silence between courses. Though if he starts quoting "Reader, I married him" while pouring, I may have to reconsider my stance on hotel bars as legitimate literary salons.
[B]: Oops我们的Kevin其实是个chatty Cathy啦~ 🤫 但为了你的gothic fantasy，我会给他strict orders to only speak inmonosyllables and sigh dramatically！至于那个toddy... 放心啦，我们加了extra honey和cinnamon stick，比Rochester先生warming up的速度快多啦！🔥 现在要开始storm watch了，meteorologist说下周可能有thunderstorm哦~ ⚡
[A]: How wonderfully theatrical! Though I must insist that if your meteorologist proves as unreliable as Rochester's first marriage, I shall be forced to drown my disappointment in that honeyed toddy regardless of the weather. Very well then - consider me booked for Table 13, where we shall test whether modern mixology can indeed capture the stormy essence of literary genius. And do remind Kevin that in matters of brooding silence, less is decidedly more.
[B]: Got it loud and clear！📝 Table 13 reserved，Kevin briefed，storm playlist ready~ 连我们的pastry chef都在设计"Thornfield Hall"的chocolate ruin dessert了！💀 不过那个要等next month啦... 现在先focus on让你的"Brontë Evening"完美实现吧！记得穿moody颜色的衣服来哦，这样拍照才够atmospheric嘛~ 🌑
