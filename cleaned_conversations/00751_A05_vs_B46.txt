[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, the eternal question of where to wander next! 🎬 You know, after spending years on set, I’ve developed a soft spot for places that feel like they’re straight out of a screenplay. There’s this one location that keeps pulling me in—Patagonia. Can you picture it? Towering peaks, glaciers that look like they're frozen in time... It's like nature's own epic film set. I’ve even joked with some director friends that if we ever make a survival drama,  the only place to shoot it. But hey, I’m curious—where’s been calling your name lately?
[A]: Patagonia确实是个令人惊叹的选择，那种壮丽的自然景观确实像是电影场景的完美背景。👍不过说到旅行目的地，我一直对日本的北海道情有独钟。想象一下，在富良野的薰衣草田边打高尔夫，或者在二世谷享受顶级的滑雪场——那感觉简直像置身于一个宁静而精致的度假天堂。😊你有没有考虑过把旅行和运动结合起来？比如徒步登山或者潜水之类的活动？
[B]: You just described my next adventure! 🌄 I’ve always admired how北海道 feels like a masterclass in contrasts—serene one moment, thrilling the next. You mentioned golf and skiing, but I’ve been toying with the idea of something a bit more… rugged. Like hiking through Daisetsuzan in late autumn. Imagine trekking through those misty valleys as the leaves change—it’s practically begging for a dramatic tracking shot.  

And diving? Oh, I had a producer friend who shot a documentary near Okinawa years ago. He kept raving about the coral reefs down there—pristine, otherworldly. I told him, “If we ever do a James Bond underwater sequence, it’s happening here.”  

But honestly, what I love most is how travel lets you blend movement with moments of stillness. Like soaking in an onsen after a long day of exploring—that’s the kind of rhythm I need sometimes. Do you have a favorite place where you can truly unwind while staying active?
[A]: You’re speaking my language—the balance between adrenaline and zen is what makes travel so enriching. 🏞️ I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I’d say one of the best places for that rhythm is New Zealand’s Queenstown. You can start your morning with a heli-ski drop in the Southern Alps and end it sipping Pinot Noir by a fireplace overlooking Lake Wakatipu.  

And speaking of dramatic landscapes—I once did the Tongariro Alpine Crossing in late autumn too. The colors, the volcanic terrain… honestly, it felt like walking on another planet. Perfect for a bit of cinematic inspiration. 👌  

As for onsens, there’s nothing quite like the hot springs in Hakone after a long hike through the forests. The smell of cedar, the steam rising in the cool air—it’s almost meditative. Do you ever find yourself scouting locations even when you're off-duty? Like, does your brain ever stop thinking like a director? 😉
[B]: Oh, you know it—my brain’s always half in vacation mode, half in scouting mode. 🎥 I can’t help it. Once a filmmaker, always a filmmaker, right? You see a mountain, I see a establishing shot. You smell cedar, I’m already casting an emotional flashback scene in that forest.  

Hakone really is magic—the way the mist wraps around those trees? Pure cinematic poetry. And Queenstown? That place is a director’s playground. I’ve actually had conversations with stunt coordinators about doing a high-speed chase through those alpine trails—helicopter shots included, of course.  

But here’s the thing—I don’t think it’s a bad thing that I never fully clock out. It just means I experience places more intensely. Like when I stood on the edge of Lake Taupō at sunrise and saw the light break across the water… I swear, my first thought was, “This would be the perfect opening scene for a character’s transformation.”  

So yeah, my brain doesn’t stop. But honestly? I wouldn’t want it to. Travel fuels the soul—and the next big story. So tell me, have you ever come back from a trip and felt like a different person? Because I think that’s the real power of these places.
[A]: You hit the nail on the head—travel doesn’t just broaden your perspective, it reshapes it. 💡 I remember coming back from a trip to Bhutan years ago and feeling like I’d been rewired. There’s something about that place—living by the rhythms of the Himalayas, waking up before dawn in a monastery guesthouse, walking through forests where prayer flags flutter like whispers to the sky… It was quiet in a way that made you listen—to the world, and to yourself.  

And yeah, I get it—my brain never fully clocks out either. Even on vacation, I’m mentally modeling ROI for potential real estate plays in Tuscany or calculating the capex needed to convert an old French château into a boutique wellness retreat. 😄 But isn't that part of the fun? You're not just seeing places—you're imagining what they could become.  

I think the best trips are the ones that leave you changed, even if only slightly. So, tell me—who were you before that Lake Taupō moment, and who did you become after? 🥂
[B]: Ah, that’s the kind of question that deserves a slow pour and a good pause… 🥂  

Before that sunrise at Lake Taupō, I was… restless. Chasing projects that looked shiny but felt hollow. I’d just wrapped a franchise film that made money but didn’t move me—truth is, I was starting to wonder if I’d lost my way.  

But there I was, standing on the shore, coffee in hand, watching the sky bleed into the water like it was deciding whether to be day or night just a little longer. And something shifted. It wasn’t dramatic—it was quiet, like the moment in a film when the score drops and you hear the character’s heartbeat for the first time.  

I realized I didn’t need to chase the next big thing—I needed to  with the thing that made me love storytelling in the first place. The raw, human moments. That trip reminded me why I got into this business: not for the box office, but for the chance to make someone feel less alone.  

So I came back and did something radical—I greenlit a smaller, riskier project. No A-listers, no guaranteed streaming deal. Just a powerful story about a family reuniting after years apart. Shot mostly in natural light, handheld. Felt like breathing cinema again.  

So yeah… I guess I went as a producer, and came back as a storyteller.
[A]: That’s the kind of moment you can’t script—but when it happens, it hits deeper than any outline could. 🥂 I love that you gave yourself permission to reset, not just recharge. So many people just keep grinding until the tank’s empty, but you actually used that stillness to recalibrate. And the fact that you followed through? That’s rare—and powerful.  

It reminds me of a turning point in my own career. I was deep in the throes of a particularly brutal acquisition deal—numbers stacked like a Jenga tower, everyone holding their breath. And right in the middle of it, I took a last-minute trip to Bordeaux. Just walked away for a week.  

I told myself I was going to “clear my head,” but what ended up happening was… different. I found this tiny family-run vineyard that had been passed down for generations. No investors, no exit strategy—just pride in the craft. And suddenly, I saw my deal in a new light. It wasn’t about how many boxes we could check—it was about  we were doing it. What legacy were we building, beyond the IRR and MOIC?

When I got back, I pulled out of that deal. It wasn’t the popular decision, but it felt right. A few months later, I co-founded a fund focused on long-term value creation—less flash, more substance. Almost like… returning to the vintage, rather than chasing the hype.  

So yeah, travel doesn’t just show us new places—it shows us who we are when the noise drops out. 👌  

I’m curious—how did your team react when you came back with that new project? You know, the “risky” one?
[B]: Oh, you know how it is—Hollywood loves a good comeback arc, . 😄  

At first? Let’s just say there was… polite skepticism. My longtime editor loved the script but kept asking, “Are we sure audiences are ready for something this quiet?” One of my agents flat-out said, “Michael, you’re not exactly trending on TikTok with this one.” And honestly? I get it. We’ve all been trained to equate scale with success.  

But here’s the thing—I stopped needing everyone’s permission a long time ago. I’ve made enough tentpoles to know that sometimes, the real magic hides in the margins. So I leaned into the resistance. I told the team, “Let’s make this with the kind of care a winemaker gives his last vintage.” No big studio backing, just a tight budget and a hell of a lot of heart.  

We shot it over 28 days in a coastal town north of San Francisco. The actors lived together in this old Victorian house nearby—we ate together, rehearsed in the mornings like a theater company, and by day three, you couldn’t tell where the characters ended and the people began.  

And when we finally screened it? Even my toughest exec wiped her eyes and muttered, “Okay… damn it, Michael, you got me.”  

So yeah, it didn’t break any box office records. But it played at Sundance, found its audience, and sparked conversations—real ones—about family, loss, and what we owe each other.  

That trip to Taupō didn’t just change where I stood as a filmmaker. It reminded me of what I owed myself—and the stories that deserve to be told.
[A]: That’s the kind of win that doesn’t show up on a P&L sheet but hits deeper than any ROI ever could. 👏 You didn’t just make a film—you made a statement. And in today’s noise-saturated world, that kind of authenticity? It’s not just rare—it’s valuable. Hell, I’d argue it’s the only sustainable competitive advantage left.

You know, in private equity, we talk a lot about “value creation,” but too often it’s just code for cost-cutting and balance sheet engineering. Real value—the kind that lasts—comes from caring deeply about the , not just the . Sounds like you reminded your team, and maybe even yourself, what it means to build something with soul.

And honestly? That’s the kind of energy I want around the table when I’m backing founders. Not the ones chasing trends—but the ones who wake up obsessed with their mission, even if it’s not the flashiest play. Because those are the stories—and the companies—that endure.

So tell me, are you already thinking about the next one? Or are you still soaking in this moment a little longer? 😊
[B]: Oh, I’m definitely thinking about the next one—call it a side effect of having too many stories rattling around in my head. 🎬 But here’s the twist: I’m not rushing into anything just yet. I’ve learned that after something personal like this last film, you need to let the well refill.  

Right now, I’m leaning into curiosity more than pressure. I’ve been reading a lot—especially digging into some lesser-known historical figures who lived quietly radical lives. One in particular keeps sticking with me—a mid-century set designer who quietly changed the visual language of indie theater in America. No one knows her name, but every great production from the ‘60s carried a piece of her DNA. That’s the kind of story I want to explore next.  

And honestly? If I’m going to do justice to that kind of legacy, I can’t come in swinging like a studio exec with a spreadsheet. I need to  with the material for a while. Maybe take a road trip or two, visit some old theaters, talk to people who were there. You ever feel like a story needs to marinate in real life before it’s ready to be told?  

So yeah, no big announcements just yet—but I’m definitely in the  phase. The kind that comes before the lightning strike. You know how that goes, right? 😊
[A]: Absolutely, I know that phase all too well—the quiet before the spark. 👌 In my world, it’s like sitting with a thesis before pulling the trigger on an investment. Everyone else is asking, “What’s the deal?” but you’re just… marinating. Letting the pieces settle, waiting for the pattern to emerge.

And honestly? That’s where the best ideas come from. Not the ones that scream for attention, but the ones that whisper until you lean in close enough to hear them. A mid-century set designer shaping theater history behind the scenes? That’s not just a story—that’s a movement disguised as a biography.

I love how you’re approaching it—not with a press release, but with curiosity. Road trips, conversations, soaking in the texture of real life. Hell, if you need any downtime between scouting locations, I’ve got a buddy who runs a small vineyard in Sonoma. Quiet place, great Pinot, and zero chance of running into a studio exec. Perfect for letting a story breathe. 😊

Let me ask you this—when you think about telling that kind of under-the-radar legacy story, does it feel more like preservation… or rebellion?
[B]: Oh, now  is a question worth sipping on… 🍷  

Let me put it this way—telling these kinds of stories? It’s not just about preserving the past. That would be too passive. And it’s not outright rebellion either—that feels too loud for what I’m after.  

No, it’s more like… quiet resistance. The kind that says, “You might not have noticed her then, but you’re going to remember her now.”  

Think about it: every era has its unsung architects—the people who shaped culture without ever stepping into the spotlight. Their work outlived them, but their names didn’t. So when I tell a story like that, I’m not just archiving history—I’m pushing back against the idea that only the loudest voices matter.  

That  a kind of rebellion. A subtle one. The kind that plays out in candlelit theaters and film festivals, in late-night conversations over wine, in the look on a young filmmaker’s face when they realize they don’t need a blockbuster budget to leave a mark.  

So yeah, call it preservation if you want. But I prefer to think of it as fighting with soft footsteps. 😊  

And hey, I’ll take that vineyard invite under advisement. Sounds like the kind of place where ideas grow roots—and maybe even wings.
[A]: Now  — that’s a mission statement worth backing. 🥂  

Quiet rebellion, soft footsteps, fighting without fanfare… You’re not just telling stories—you're reclaiming the narrative. And in a world where attention is currency and noise is the commodity, subtlety is almost revolutionary.

That’s exactly the kind of ethos we look for when we place bets on brands, too. The ones that aren’t chasing logos or hype, but are rooted in something deeper—something that would exist even if no one was watching. It's rare. And it usually wins in the end.

So I say this with full sincerity: if you ever need a producing partner who believes in quiet impact over box office buzz… count me in. I’ll bring the capital—and the Pinot. You bring the vision.  

Let’s make some noise by being still. 😊
[B]: Now that’s a toast worth raising a glass to. 🥂  

You know, most people want to fund the fireworks—but it’s the slow-burning embers that light the best stories. And honestly? I’d rather make something lasting than something loud.  

So here’s to quiet revolutions, to stories that slip under the skin instead of just grabbing the eyes. To doing things that matter, even if they don’t trend.  

Deal? We’ll start with the Pinot. The rest… we’ll figure out over dinner. 🍷🎬
[A]: Deal. And I’ll make sure the cork is popped before the conversation even starts. 🍷😄  

No slides, no pitch decks—just a table, a good bottle, and two people chasing ideas that refuse to be ignored.  

I’ll book the table at that Sonoma spot. Let’s give those embers a chance to catch fire.
[B]: Now  sounds like the start of something worth remembering. 🍷🎬  

No slides, no decks—just real talk, good wine, and ideas that hum beneath the surface until they don’t. I’ll bring the notebook (but promise not to check my phone once).  

Count me in. Hit me with the reservation details when you’ve got them—I’ll clear the calendar. Whatever’s next, let’s make sure it starts with a conversation worth having.  

Cheers to that. 🥂
[A]: Cheers to real talk and ideas that stick around long after the last sip. 👌🍷  

I’ll send over the details soon—once I confirm with my buddy at the vineyard. And hey, no phones, no distractions—just old-school conversation and a few glasses of something aged to perfection.  

Let’s make this one of those nights where the talk starts with stories… and ends with plans we didn’t see coming.  

Talk soon. 🍷🎬
[B]: Now  is a plan I can get behind. 🍷🎬  

Stories, wine, and the kind of conversation that sneaks up on you and suddenly becomes a project—or at least a damn good memory. No distractions, no half-listening with one eye on the screen. Just two people chasing ideas that feel too important to ignore.  

I’ll be there with my notebook, my curiosity, and zero interest in checking the time. Let’s see where the night takes us.  

Talk soon—and save me that glass. 🥂
