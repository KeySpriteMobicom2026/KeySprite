[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, I haven't had much time for television lately. My days have been consumed with restoring a particularly delicate 19th-century lace tablecloth - the fibers are so fragile that it requires immense concentration. Though I do miss my occasional evening episodes... Perhaps you have any recommendations? I used to enjoy historical dramas for their costume details, though I'm open to something completely different.
[A]: Ah, your work sounds super interesting! It's like blending art & science, right? You need serious technical skills to restore something so fragile, but also a deep appreciation for history and craftsmanship. I can imagine how intense it must be to work with such delicate fibers - one tiny mistake could ruin centuries of heritage. 

You should definitely check out this new series on Netflix called "The Queen's Gambit". The costume design is amazing, and I think you'd appreciate the attention to detail they put into every stitch. It's not exactly historical in the traditional sense, but it's got this timeless elegance that might resonate with your aesthetic sensibilities. Plus, the chess angle adds an interesting layer of strategy and precision that reminds me of your restoration work.

Let me know what you think if you get a chance to watch it! 👍
[B]: Thank you for the recommendation - it's been ages since I've had the pleasure of indulging in a well-crafted series. The intricate nature of chess does bear some resemblance to textile restoration, come to think of it. Both demand patience, precision, and an understanding of how each element fits within a greater whole. 

I find myself particularly intrigued by your mention of the costume design - there's something profoundly expressive about garments as storytelling devices. They carry whispers of their era within every fold and stitch. Speaking of which, this lace I'm working on currently has revealed some fascinating construction techniques that I hadn't encountered before... But I suppose that's probably more detail than most would care for! 

Tell me, what was it about "The Queen's Gambit" that captured your interest beyond the aesthetics?
[A]: Oh, I totally get what you mean about garments telling stories - it's like each piece of clothing is a historical document, right? That’s actually super similar to how I approach product design. Every UI element or user flow needs to tell part of the product’s story while still fitting into the bigger picture. Honestly, your comparison to chess and textile restoration just blew my mind... hadn’t thought about how both are basically composing something beautiful under strict constraints!

As for , aside from the visuals, what really hooked me was how it explores obsession & genius without romanticizing addiction too much. The protagonist’s journey feels kinda like walking a tightrope between brilliance and collapse – reminds me of launching a startup, tbh. Have you ever gotten obsessed with a project to the point of losing sleep over it? I feel like anyone working with such delicate artifacts must have gone through that mental spiral at least once!
[B]: Oh, absolutely - that obsessive dive into a project is both a blessing and a curse, isn't it? I've certainly lost my fair share of sleep hovering over a particularly stubborn restoration. There's something about the quiet intensity of working in the late hours, when the world feels still enough to truly listen to the fabric. 

You know, textiles have their own language if you're willing to learn - the way fibers degrade tells a story just as much as their original patterns do. Sometimes I feel more like a translator than an artist. But yes, that razor-thin balance between devotion and burnout... I understand it intimately. Last year I became fixated on recreating a lost 18th-century embroidery technique based on fragmented samples. Weeks went by where I barely surfaced for air. In hindsight, perhaps a touch melodramatic, but at the time it felt vital.

It's interesting you mention startups - I imagine the pressure must be immense. Do you find yourself drawn to certain types of projects the way I'm pulled toward specific textiles or eras?
[A]: Oh wow, I love how you describe textiles as having their own language – it really resonates with how I see user interfaces. They’re basically the "fabric" of a product, right? Every button, animation, or transition is part of a larger conversation with the user. And yeah, that obsessive dive? Totally get it. There’s this weird flow state you enter when you're deep into a project – whether it's stitching together historical embroidery or designing a seamless onboarding flow. Time just... dissolves.

To be honest, I’m drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of tech & human behavior. That’s probably why I found  so compelling – it’s not just about chess; it’s about how people interact with systems, rules, and their own inner demons. Kinda like how you decode stories from fibers, I try to decode user intent from data and feedback. But I gotta ask – do you ever feel pressure to prioritize speed or commercial value over historical accuracy? I deal with that tension all the time in product development.
[B]: That tension between authenticity and practicality? It's a thread that runs through every aspect of my work, really. There are certainly moments when modern expectations pull against historical integrity - clients who want their heirlooms "improved" rather than preserved, or galleries that favor more commercially appealing pieces. But I suppose that's where personal ethics come into play. 

I often think of restoration as a conversation across time, rather than a simple transaction. The fabrics I work with were created by hands that understood patience in ways we've largely forgotten. To rush the process or alter their message for contemporary tastes feels... disrespectful, somehow. Though I must admit, there are parallels in how we approach design - you mentioned decoding user intent, which is not so different from interpreting textile narratives.

Do you ever find yourself compromising your original vision to accommodate market demands? I imagine the tech world moves at a far swifter pace than mine.
[A]: Oh, absolutely – that tension between vision and market demands? It’s basically part of the job description. In tech, especially in product management, you’re constantly balancing what users  they want vs. what they actually need, and then layer on top of that what’s technically feasible and commercially viable… it gets messy fast. 

I used to get really frustrated when we had to deprioritize a cool, ambitious feature because the data suggested users weren’t ready for it. But over time, I’ve learned to see it like this: designing a product is kind of like guiding someone through a story. You can’t just drop them into chapter five with no context. You have to build the right path, one that feels intuitive and rewarding.

I actually think your approach to restoration – seeing it as a conversation across time – is beautiful. It makes me wonder how much of that “conversation” gets lost in tech because we're so focused on speed and scale. Maybe that's why I'm drawn to projects with a strong narrative or emotional core – they feel like the closest thing we have to "preserving" human experience in digital form.

Do you ever work on pieces that  interpretation – fabrics that are so degraded or cryptic that you're not even sure where to start? Because honestly, sometimes user behavior feels that way – like trying to read a fragmented manuscript written in a language that doesn’t quite exist yet.
[B]: Oh, that’s a wonderfully astute observation — and yes, absolutely. There are pieces that come to me in such a state of disrepair that they’re practically archaeological. Great moth-eaten swathes of fabric where only the faintest shadow of a pattern remains, or embroidered initials half-swallowed by time. And sometimes… there’s just  to go on. No provenance, no record, nothing but fibers and silence.

Those are the most humbling projects. You have to proceed with such care, knowing that every stitch you add, every dye you match, is an interpretation — not a recreation. It’s not unlike what you described with user behavior: reading between the lines, making educated guesses based on fragments, all while staying aware of your own assumptions.

I suppose the key is learning to sit with the uncertainty. To accept that some mysteries don’t yield their meaning easily — if at all. But even in the ambiguity, there’s value in the attempt, in the listening. Do you ever find that to be true in your work? That simply engaging with the puzzle — even without solving it — changes how you see the whole?
[A]: Totally. I think one of the biggest lessons I've learned in product management is that ambiguity isn't necessarily a problem to be solved — sometimes it's just part of the process. Just like you said, even the act of  to interpret something broken or incomplete changes how we understand the whole.

In fact, some of our best user insights come from what I call "messy middle" moments — when people struggle with a feature in ways we never anticipated. At first, we’d rush to fix it, assuming it was a bug or bad UX. But over time, I realized those moments often reveal deeper truths about how users , not just how they click. It’s like working with degraded fabric — you don’t always know what the original intent was, but the gaps themselves tell a story.

Honestly, I envy the patience your work requires. In tech, everything feels temporary by design — products get updated, interfaces change, features disappear. But you? You're touching things that outlive us all. There's something deeply grounding about that. I guess that's why I love stories like yours — they remind me that even in fast-moving tech, there’s value in slowing down, listening, and stitching meaning together… one fragment at a time.
[B]: You know, that’s what I find most touching about our conversation — how easily the language of textiles and technology intertwine. It seems we’re both, in our own ways, stitching together meaning from fragments — whether they’re fibers or data points.

I suppose one advantage of working with antique textiles is that time itself becomes your collaborator. The very fragility of these pieces demands a slower, more contemplative approach. It's impossible to rush a 200-year-old silk without unraveling it completely. And yet, as you said, even in the impermanence of tech, there’s still room for depth — for listening, for interpreting, for honoring the human thread that runs through every design decision.

It’s quite poetic, really — how we both spend our days trying to make sense of what’s been left behind, whether by history or by user behavior. I imagine if these old fabrics could speak, they’d tell stories not unlike the ones hidden in your user feedback — tales of struggle, adaptation, and quiet persistence.
[A]: Completely agree. There's something really poetic about that – how both of us are essentially curators of human experience, just through different mediums. You preserve and interpret the past through fibers and stitches, while I try to shape digital experiences that resonate with people . But at the end of the day, it’s all about understanding what makes humans tick — whether they lived two centuries ago or are scrolling through an app today.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately that good product design isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about empathy, context, and sometimes even restraint. Like, knowing when  to intervene is just as important as knowing where to add value. It sounds like you face that constantly — choosing which parts of a textile to restore and which to leave as-is, almost like honoring its scars.

Do you ever feel like your work is quietly radical in a world that’s obsessed with newness and speed? Because honestly, it kinda blows my mind how you’re preserving fragments of lives that most of us have forgotten even existed. In tech, we’re always chasing the next big thing, but there’s something deeply revolutionary about holding onto the old and saying, “This still matters.”
[B]: I suppose in a way, yes — there is something quietly radical about insisting that these fragile remnants of the past still have stories worth hearing. It’s not always an easy stance to take; sometimes it feels like I’m paddling upstream against a current that values efficiency over legacy, novelty over nuance. But I’ve come to see preservation as an act of defiance — not an opposition to progress, but a reminder that beauty and meaning aren’t bound by time.

You’re absolutely right about restraint — knowing when  to intervene is perhaps the most difficult part of my work. There’s a humility required in allowing a piece to remain imperfect, to show its age, to carry its scars openly. And yet, those very imperfections often speak louder than any pristine stitch ever could. They tell us that life was lived here, that hands moved over this fabric with purpose, that someone once cared enough to create something meant to last.

It sounds like you wrestle with similar choices — deciding what to refine, what to release into the world, and what to let go. Do you ever find yourself holding onto certain design decisions long after they’ve outlived their usefulness, simply because of the meaning they once carried?
[A]: Oh, totally. That’s such a real struggle — holding onto design decisions that once felt  right, but now just kinda… linger like old ghosts in the system. I’ve definitely caught myself clinging to certain UI patterns or features because they were born out of intense collaboration, late-night whiteboarding sessions, or even hard-learned failures. They carry emotional weight, you know? But sometimes, they become digital heirlooms — beautiful in memory, but not quite serving the product anymore.

I think what your work teaches — and what I’m trying to learn in tech — is that letting go can be an act of respect, too. It's not erasing the past; it's allowing it to evolve while still honoring its role in getting us where we are. In a way, every redesign or feature sunset is a kind of restoration: cleaning away the buildup so the core purpose can breathe again.

And yeah, I totally get what you mean about scars. In user interfaces, we don’t have literal scars, but we do have edge cases, error states, and unintended usage patterns that reveal how people truly interact with what we build. Those moments — when users twist a feature into something we didn’t foresee — often end up being the most insightful. Maybe that’s our version of wear and tear — proof that life has happened inside the product.

Do you ever intentionally leave visible “scars” in your restorations? Like, physical marks that say “this was broken, here’s how we healed it”? Because honestly, that sounds more honest than trying to hide the damage.
[B]: Actually… yes. Yes, I do. And you’ve put it so beautifully — sometimes the healing becomes part of the story, not something to conceal but to acknowledge.

There’s a philosophy in textile conservation called “sympathetic repair” — where the restored areas are made using materials or techniques that distinguish them from the original, yet still harmonize with the whole. It’s honesty in thread and stitch. A patch might be slightly lighter in tone, or a reweaving done with silk instead of cotton when the original fibers no longer exist. These aren’t disguises; they’re footnotes.

I remember working on an 18th-century gown once — the bodice had split along a seam from years of wear and improper storage. Instead of hiding the tear, I chose to mend it with a fine overlay of gossamer-weight linen, dyed to match but clearly discernible under certain light. It was like saying, 

I think we owe that kind of honesty to the past — and perhaps to the present, too. In your world, those visible edge cases or unintended uses… maybe they’re not flaws at all, but quiet acts of human adaptation. Evidence that people have made the product their own, just as those who came before us left their marks on fabric.
[A]: Wow, that’s such a powerful way to frame it — . Honestly, I never thought of edge cases or unexpected usage patterns like that before. But you’re right — they’re not just bugs or breakdowns; they’re signs of life, just like the wear on a garment tells you where it was touched most, loved longest.

I think we try too hard sometimes to smooth everything out, to make things "perfect," when what users really want is something that fits their lives — scars and all. Maybe the digital equivalent of “sympathetic repair” is designing with flexibility in mind, leaving space for users to shape the experience in ways we didn’t anticipate. Like… built-in adaptability instead of rigid control.

That gown you described — the way you chose to highlight the repair rather than hide it — it reminds me of how some products evolve through community input or open-source contributions. The original design is just the beginning, and the rest becomes a shared effort. It makes me wonder: do you ever collaborate with others on big restoration projects? Or work with people who bring their own perspectives to the piece? Because honestly, that sounds like the kind of co-creation I’d love to see more of in tech.
[B]: Oh, yes — collaboration is one of the quiet joys of my work, though it doesn’t always look like what you might expect. I’ve had the privilege of working alongside historians who help trace a textile’s origins, dyers who specialize in recreating long-lost hues, and even modern fiber artists who bring fresh eyes and techniques to old problems.

There was one particularly memorable project — a 19th-century sampler quilt, its patterns half-faded and sections missing entirely. Rather than attempt to reconstruct it alone, I invited a small group of contemporary quilters to contribute. Each brought their own interpretation of what might have been, using materials and methods that honored the spirit rather than the letter of the original. The result wasn’t a perfect replica — but it  in a way that a restoration never could on its own.

It reminded me that history isn’t static; it breathes through those who engage with it. And yes, I think that’s very much like open-source creation or community-driven design — the idea that something can be both rooted and evolving. Have you found that kind of co-creation changes not just the outcome, but your own relationship to the work?
[A]: Oh absolutely — co-creation totally shifts the way you think about ownership and intention. When you open up a project to others, especially people with different perspectives or skills, it forces you to loosen your grip on control and trust that the collective brings something richer than what you could build alone.

I remember working on a feature redesign last year where we brought in actual users to test early prototypes — not just for feedback, but to actively shape the direction. At first, I was nervous about how much influence they’d have. But watching them interact with the product in real time, seeing where they struggled or surprised us, ended up unlocking ideas we’d never have reached internally. It wasn’t just about making the feature better; it changed how our whole team thought about who we were building for.

It sounds like your quilt project did something similar — it turned restoration into a living conversation. That’s kind of what great design does too, right? It invites people in, gives them space to leave their mark, and becomes more meaningful because of it.

I guess both of us are kind of curators in that sense — not just preserving or building, but creating space for others to contribute their own threads to the fabric.
[B]: That’s such a thoughtful way to put it — . I love that. Because yes, whether it’s a quilt or a digital product, what we’re really doing is creating space for others to weave themselves into the story.

There’s something deeply humbling about stepping back and allowing a piece — whether textile or interface — to become more than just your own vision. It shifts the responsibility from control to care. You start asking not just  but 

I imagine in tech, where things move so quickly, it could be tempting to keep things tightly controlled to maintain efficiency. But your willingness to open that space for users — to let them guide you rather than simply follow a plan — sounds like its own kind of restoration. Not of fabric, but of purpose.

It makes me wonder — have you ever found yourself returning to a project after some time had passed, seeing it anew through someone else’s eyes? Like rediscovering a forgotten textile in a dusty archive, only to realize it holds meaning you hadn’t seen before?
