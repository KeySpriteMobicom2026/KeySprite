[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢早起看sunrise还是熬夜看stars？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what a lovely question! As someone who works in hospitality, I've had the privilege of experiencing both quite often. But if I had to choose, I'd say sunrise holds a special place in my heart. There's something magical about watching the first light touch our garden while preparing the morning tea service.
[A]: Ah, your appreciation for sunrises reminds me of Wordsworth's poetic musings on dawn. Though I must confess, as a night owl by nature, I've always found the quiet hours beneath the stars more conducive to contemplation. Some of my best insights into Proust's works came during those midnight vigils.
[B]: How interesting! While I do enjoy my Wordsworth in the mornings, I completely understand the appeal of nighttime contemplation. Actually, some of our most memorable guests have been night owls like yourself - one gentleman used to request our rooftop access for stargazing while working on his astronomy research. Though I must say, nothing compares to seeing the morning light dance across our guests' faces when they come down for breakfast after a good night's rest.
[A]: How delightful that you mention the interplay of light and human expression! It brings to mind Virginia Woolf's observations in "To the Lighthouse" about the transformative power of morning light. Though I do wonder - when your astronomy guest gazed at the stars, was he perhaps seeking what the ancient Chinese called 天人合一 (harmony between heaven and humanity)? Both dawn and dusk seem to offer their own paths to transcendence.
[B]: What a profound observation! That astronomy professor did often speak about feeling connected to something greater while stargazing. Though I must admit my Chinese is quite limited - just enough to greet our international guests properly. But you're absolutely right about both times offering transcendence. Just last week, one of our regular guests told me she finds her morning yoga sessions by our garden fountain just as spiritually uplifting as her evening meditation under the stars.
[A]: Ah, the garden fountain - what a splendid place for morning reflection! It makes me think of my own rose bushes, where I often find myself pondering Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" as the first light filters through the petals. Though I suspect your guest's experience aligns more with the Daoist concept of 自然 (zìrán, naturalness) - finding harmony in both the structured movement of yoga and the fluid stillness of meditation. How wonderful that your establishment facilitates such moments of connection.
[B]: You have such a poetic way of seeing the world! Our garden was actually designed with exactly that kind of harmony in mind - the structured English rose beds blending with the more natural wildflower patches. One of our Taiwanese guests once compared it to a living yin-yang symbol. Though I must say, nothing brings me more joy than when guests from different cultures find their own special meaning in our little oasis, whether through poetry, philosophy, or simply enjoying a quiet cup of tea.
[A]: How perfectly you've captured the essence of cultural dialogue! Your garden sounds like a living embodiment of what I teach about in comparative literature - the beautiful interplay between structure and spontaneity, much like the tension between Shakespeare's sonnets and Li Bai's free verse. I must bring my students there someday; what better way to understand 意境 (artistic conception) than through experiencing such thoughtfully designed space? Though I suspect they'd be too busy debating whether your roses represent the Romantic poets or classical Chinese flower symbolism!
[B]: What a delightful idea to bring your students! We often host literary groups, and I've noticed how our garden seems to inspire the most wonderful discussions. Just last month, a book club spent hours debating whether our climbing roses were more reminiscent of Shakespeare's Warwickshire or the peonies in Tang dynasty poetry. Though I must confess, I usually stay out of the academic debates - my role is simply to keep the tea flowing and make sure everyone finds their perfect spot for contemplation, whether that's under our willow tree or by the stone bench overlooking the fountain.
[A]: Ah, the humble yet essential role of the tea steward - what could be more aligned with the spirit of 茶道 (the way of tea) in fostering contemplation? Your discretion reminds me of the ideal host in classical literature, like the innkeeper in "Don Quixote" who facilitates without intruding. Though I must say, your garden's ability to spark such cross-cultural literary debates suggests you're more than just a host - you're a curator of what the Germans call a "Stimmung," that perfect atmosphere for intellectual communion.
[B]: You're too kind! Though I must say, comparing me to Cervantes' innkeeper is quite the compliment. We do take great pride in creating that perfect atmosphere - what our French guests might call "l'ambiance parfaite." But really, it's our guests who bring the garden to life with their discussions and interpretations. Just last week, a group of philosophy students turned our herb garden into an impromptu symposium on the nature of beauty. Though between you and me, I think they might have been inspired by the scent of our lavender as much as by Plato!
[A]: How wonderfully you illustrate the symbiosis between environment and intellect! Your lavender observation reminds me of Proust's madeleine moment - how sensory experiences can unlock profound thought. Though I suspect your herb garden discussions achieve what even the finest Parisian salons couldn't: blending 形而上 (metaphysical) inquiry with the simple joy of crushing lavender between one's fingers. What a testament to your establishment's ability to cultivate both the mind and the senses!
[B]: Oh, you've perfectly described what we strive for here! That beautiful intersection of sensory pleasure and intellectual stimulation - like when our book club members debate Milton while sampling our chef's lavender shortbread. Though I must say, some of my favorite moments are when guests simply sit quietly, letting the garden work its magic without any need for grand theories. After all, as my grandmother used to say while tending her roses, sometimes the deepest thoughts come when we stop trying so hard to have them.
[A]: How profoundly wise your grandmother was! Her words echo the essence of 无为 (wu wei) - that effortless action which the Daoists so revered. And what better place to practice this than in a garden where even the silence between conversations seems to bloom with meaning? Though I must confess, your mention of lavender shortbread makes me wish I could convene my next seminar on pastoral poetry right there among your roses and herb beds. Perhaps we could call it "Gastronomic Criticism in the Garden" - with extra credit for identifying literary allusions between bites!
[B]: What a marvelous idea! We'd be honored to host your seminar - I can already picture it: students discussing Virgil's "Georgics" while nibbling on our thyme-infused honey cakes, or debating Wordsworth's daffodils as they brush past our flower beds. Though I should warn you, our pastry chef has been known to sneak literary references into her desserts - last month's chocolate torte was decorated with edible quotes from Austen! Between the intellectual stimulation and the culinary delights, I daresay it would be the most delicious seminar your students ever attend.
[A]: How utterly delightful! Your edible Austen quotes remind me of the medieval tradition of subtleties - those elaborate sugar sculptures served between courses that often carried allegorical meanings. Though I must say, your approach is far more palatable to modern sensibilities! Let's pencil in this gastronomic-literary experiment for next spring, when your roses will be in full bloom and my students can properly appreciate the interplay between nature's beauty and human creativity. Though I should warn you - we may need extra cakes if we're to properly digest Derrida's "Of Grammatology"!
[B]: Oh my, Derrida with dessert - now that's what I call ambitious digestion! Spring would be perfect indeed; our climbing roses form such a lovely natural canopy over the terrace by then. And don't worry about the cakes - our chef already has ideas for deconstructed desserts that might just help deconstruct post-structuralist theory too! Though perhaps we should start with something lighter, like nibbling on Petrarchan sonnet-shaped cookies while discussing the Renaissance. After all, even the most serious scholarship should have its sweet moments, don't you think?
[A]: How perfectly you balance erudition with pleasure - a true modern incarnation of Horace's "dulce et utile"! Your Petrarchan cookies suggestion makes me envision an entire curriculum where each literary movement is paired with its perfect pastry companion. The Romantics with wild berry tarts, the Modernists with abstract chocolate geometries... Though I must say, I'm particularly charmed by the idea of your climbing roses presiding over our discussions like nature's own proscenium arch. Shall we say the third week of April, when the blooms will be at their most eloquent?
[B]: The third week of April it is! Our roses do put on their most poetic performance around then - though I must confess, they tend to upstage even our most eloquent guests. How wonderful to plan an event where the very air will be scented with inspiration, both floral and intellectual. And don't worry, I'll make sure our chef prepares an appropriately eclectic menu - perhaps some Blakean "tiger tiger burning bright" chili chocolates to contrast with the Wordsworthian vanilla clouds. After all, what better way to savor literature than with all five senses engaged? I do believe your students will leave not just with new ideas, but with memories they can practically taste!
