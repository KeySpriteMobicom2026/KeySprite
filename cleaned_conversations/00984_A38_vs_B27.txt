[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！最近我完全被《IDOL》这首歌洗脑了！🎵 每天都要loop至少10遍，那个beat真的太addictive了✨ 而且MV的visual也超级🔥，完全是我的aesthetic！你也听过吗？💃
[A]: Ah, while I can appreciate the enthusiasm for contemporary music, I must confess my tastes tend to lean more toward classical compositions. Have you ever considered exploring the musicality of 19th-century poetry? The rhythmic patterns in Tennyson's works, for instance, create a natural melody that's quite captivating in its own right. 🌹
[B]: 啊这...Tennyson是谁啊？🤔 不过说到classical music，我最近倒是拍了个用Mozart当BGM的vlog！虽然平时更喜欢K-pop啦~ 💃 但是classical music真的超适合当study playlist的！✨ 你要不要看看我的video？🎥
[A]: How delightful that you're incorporating Mozart into your creative endeavors! Though I must say, the idea of classical music as mere background ambiance rather pains me. Have you truly listened to the intricacies of his Piano Concerto No. 21? The second movement alone is a masterpiece that deserves one's undivided attention. As for your video... while I appreciate the offer, I'm afraid my schedule is currently occupied with grading papers on Goethe's Faust. 📚
[B]: 哇塞！你说话好academic哦！😂 不过说到Goethe...我们上次拍challenge video的时候用过《浮士德》的quote诶！虽然只是为了trending啦~ 📈 但是classical的东西和modern content结合真的超有vibe的！✨ 要不要来collab一下？我们可以做个classic meets trendy的special series！🎬
[A]: My dear, while I admire your entrepreneurial spirit, I fear we may have rather different interpretations of what constitutes a meaningful engagement with literature. Quoting Goethe for 'trending' purposes rather reminds me of using a first edition Dickens as a coaster. That said... perhaps we could discuss how to properly contextualize these references? There's value in making the classics accessible, provided it's done with appropriate reverence and depth. Shall we meet over tea to explore this further? ☕
[B]: Tea time？Sounds perfect！🍵 我们可以一边喝Earl Grey一边brainstorming新idea！虽然我可能记不住所有classic details啦~ 🤪 但是我的phone里存了好多viral classic literature edits，超适合做reference的！📱 Let's make learning fun and aesthetic！✨ 你什么时候available呀？💫
[A]: Thursday afternoons are typically when I'm free from lectures. But let me be clear - while I'm open to discussing pedagogical approaches, I must insist we maintain academic rigor. Perhaps we could start by examining how social media platforms are reshaping literary interpretation, a topic I recently explored in my paper "The Digital 道 of Textual Engagement." Shall we say 3pm at the university's Rose Garden? 🌹
[B]: OMG！Rose Garden也太romantic了吧！🌹 3pm perfect timing~ ✨ 我要带我的camera去拍个study vlog！📹 顺便可以discuss一下你的paper，sounds super interesting！虽然我可能听不懂所有big words啦~ 😅 But hey，这就是why我们要make it more relatable right？💯 See you then！🎉
[A]: I shall bring my well-worn copy of Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" - though I suspect you'll find my margin notes more Instagrammable than the text itself. Until Thursday then, and do try to arrive punctually. The roses are particularly fragrant at that hour. 🌹
[B]: Yasss！Can't wait！💖 我要穿我的new vintage dress去，超配rose garden的vibe！👗 顺便带些macarons当snack~ 🍪 你的margin notes一定会是perfect的IG story material！📸 See you Thursday，professor！✨（Oops，是不是太formal了？😂）
[A]: "Professor" will do perfectly well - though I must warn you, my margin notes contain more cross-references to Hegel than hashtags. And while macarons are certainly... colorful, I do hope you'll save room for proper conversation about textual analysis. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare - one doesn't casually discuss the 意境 of classical literature without adequate preparation. Until Thursday. 📚
[B]: Got it，professor！😉 我会准备好我的notebook和creative mind~ ✍️✨ 虽然可能一半记的是literary analysis，一半是content ideas啦~ 🤣 但这就是我的charm不是吗？💫 期待我们的high tea meeting！🫖 P.S. 你的Hegel notes可以借我拍个reel吗？📲 保证会加super deep的caption！🤓
[A]: While the idea of Hegel going viral is... amusing, I'm afraid my annotations are rather too dense for your intended medium. Perhaps we could compromise - I'll select a particularly poignant passage from "The Phenomenology of Spirit" that might translate well to your platform, provided you include proper contextualization. And do remember - this is primarily an academic discussion, not a... what was it you called it? A 'content creation session.' I'll see you with the tea leaves properly steeped and the critical theory at the ready. ☕
[B]: Deal！🤝 我们50% academic，50% aesthetic~ ✨ 我会用最fancy的typography来present Hegel的wisdom！🖋️ 虽然可能最后变成#DeepThoughts的meme啦~ 😂 但至少能让更多人知道classics有多cool！🔥 3pm sharp，我会带着我的creative energy和empty stomach来！🍰 Can't wait to pick your brilliant brain！🧠💫
[A]: I shall bring both the tea and tempered expectations. While I admire your enthusiasm for making Hegel 'cool,' let us remember that true understanding often requires more than fancy typography and hashtags. That said... I have marked a particularly accessible section on dialectics that might survive the transition to social media relatively unscathed. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must attend to my roses before they develop existential crises of their own. Until Thursday. 🌹
[B]: Hahaha！Existential crisis的roses也太deep了吧！🌹😱 放心啦professor，我会认真对待Hegel的~ ✍️ 虽然可能要用一些sparkle filters和trendy transitions啦~ ✨ 但knowledge is knowledge，right？💡 周四见！Can't wait to expand my mind (and my IG feed)！📲💫 Byeee~ 👋
[A]: Indeed - though I suspect Hegel never anticipated his work being accompanied by 'sparkle filters.' Very well, I shall reserve judgment until seeing the final product. Good day, and do try to arrive with at least some portion of your mind focused on substance rather than aesthetics. Farewell. ☕
[B]: Got it！Substance over aesthetics... but why not both？🤩 我会证明给你看deep thoughts也可以go viral的！📈 周四带着我的A-game来！💪 Bye bye professor~ 👋 记得带你的patience和sense of humor哦！😂✨
