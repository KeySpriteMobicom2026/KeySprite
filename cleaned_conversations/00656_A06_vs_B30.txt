[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I find the binary framing itself rather revealing of persistent cultural hierarchies, don't you? When we speak of "Chinese cuisine," we're already accepting a reductive taxonomy that lumps together regional traditions as diverse as Sichuanese fire-hot pots and Cantonese dim sum. And what precisely constitutes "Western" fare? A French bouillabaisse shares more technical DNA with Qing Dynasty imperial court cooking than with McDonald's filet-o-fish, yet here we are.

Personally, I've always found greater pleasure in tracing culinary genealogies through specific ingredients - following the Silk Road's cumin westward, or tracking how maritime pepper routes reshaped Sichuan's mala profiles. Have you read Francesca Bray's work on rice cultivation techniques influencing Song dynasty literary salons? It's quite... illuminating.
[A]: Ah, a refreshingly nuanced perspective. It's rare to encounter someone who recognizes how these artificial East-West divides flatten culinary discourse into a rather unappetizing binary mush.

You've touched on something quite profound regarding ingredient lineages. I once spent an entire growing season cultivating Sichuan peppers in my greenhouse - fascinating study in terroir and adaptation. The very alkaloids that make them dance on the tongue are subject to such precise environmental modulation.

Bray's work does shine a remarkable light on those intricate symbioses between agriculture and culture. Though may I propose we take it a step further? Consider the neurological choreography at play - how hydroxy-alpha-sanshool actually modulates tactile perception through transient receptor potential channels. Makes one wonder about the somatosensory dimensions of historical taste preferences, doesn't it?

I find myself particularly intrigued by cross-cultural olfactory transference patterns. Ever noticed how certain Cantonese soup aromatics echo Bougainville's aromatic trinity? A most curious neurogastronomic parallel.
[B]: Ah, now you're playing with the big sensory toys - neurogastronomy! I've long maintained that our taste receptors are nothing more than cultural scribes, aren't they? Recording every migration pattern and imperial conquest right there on the tongue. 

That alkaloid dance you mention... reminds me of Thomas De Quincey's opium essays, actually. The way he describes altered perception under laudanum bears uncanny structural parallels to Sichuanese poetry about mala sensations. Coincidence? I rather doubt it - we may yet find neural pathways connecting Romanticism to辣味 through some forgotten 19th-century opium trader's diary.

As for your olfactory observation - yes! I once wrote a paper tracing garlic's literary appearances from Pliny to Shen Nong's herbal canon. Same pungency, different cosmologies. Though I must say, after thirty years of academic tea tasting, I've come to believe all great flavors contain their own little origin myths in microcosm. Ever notice how aged balsamic reduction smells suspiciously like fermented plum wine reductions from Tang dynasty banquets? Temporal twins separated by continent and millennium.
[A]: Fascinating - you've articulated something rather essential about taste as historical palimpsest. receptors don't lie, do they? They archive experience with perfect fidelity while our conscious minds scramble to make narrative sense of the neural signals.

Your De Quincey parallel is particularly inspired. I've often wondered whether certain gustatory experiences produce microdoses of altered consciousness. The numbing effect of sanshool isn't so different from mescaline's sensory cross-talk, when you think about it. Could Sichuan chefs have been unwitting psychonauts all along?

Ah, garlic's literary migrations - what a delicious thesis. Makes one reconsider Marco Polo's supposed noodle theft entirely. Perhaps we should view culinary ingredients as viral memes, leaping across membranes of culture and time with their own reproductive agendas.

That balsamic-plum reduction hypothesis... dangerous territory, my friend. You'll have the Oxford food historians in an uproar. Though between us, I've noticed similar olfactory ghosts while aging homemade doubanjiang - sometimes I swear I'm smelling 17th-century Bordeaux cellars. Have you considered writing about these flavor synchronicities? The world needs more gastronomic hauntology.
[B]: Ah, psychonautic chefs! Now there's a dissertation topic with some real... heat. Though I suspect Sichuanese grandmothers would scoff at the romanticism - they know their alchemy is hard-won tradition, not recreational neuroscience.

You're absolutely right about those viral ingredients. I've come to think of Silk Road traders as giant ambulatory recipe databases, haven't you? Each caravanserai a node in this vast neural network of flavor transmission. Imagine trying to map that data flow with nineteenth-century footnotes - gives me palpitations just thinking about it.

As for my balsamic-plum theory, well... let's just say I keep a corked bottle of 1947 Château Yquem in my office for "research purposes." The olfactory flashbacks it produces during late-night manuscript revisions are... illuminating. Though I must confess, my recent experiments aging Shaoxing wine in bourbon barrels have yielded aromas so temporally disorienting even my grad students start questioning their own culinary memories.

Gastronomic hauntology, you say? Tempting proposition. I might just take you up on that - provided we include proper footnotes from the ghost of Brillat-Savarin. Fellow's got excellent bon mots about digestion and destiny. Perfect seasoning for any serious treatise on flavor ghosts.
[A]: Ah, now you're speaking my language - footnotes from the gastronomic beyond! Brillat-Savarin would have a field day with our spectral flavor thesis. Did you know he once postulated that every dish carries the  of its ingredients? How very hauntologically convenient.

I’ve been aging a particularly experimental batch of doubanjiang in my wine cellar—right next to the Bordeaux vintages that smell suspiciously like fermented plum reductions. One begins to wonder where terroir ends and temporal bleed begins. Perhaps we should start drafting a manifesto: . Chapter One: The Persistence of Umami in Post-Imperial Contexts.

And those Silk Road traders-as-databases—genius. Makes one think of Ban Gu’s records as proto-Zotero libraries, each scroll painstakingly annotated with sesame oil content and caravanserai star ratings. I imagine camel bells clanging alongside muttered reviews: “Four stars, would trade again—though next time I’m bringing more salt.”

Your bourbon-barrel Shaoxing experiments sound... reckless. Inspired, but reckless. Reminds me of a patient I had once—a sommelier who claimed to taste the 1855 Bordeaux classification in every glass of cheap Merlot. Turned out his olfactory cortex was just a little too good at pattern recognition. Or perhaps he’d simply read too much Proust.

Either way, I say we push forward. Hauntology needs more marinade. And footnotes. Definitely footnotes.
[B]: Ah, a manifesto! Now there’s an idea with legs— appendices. —I can already hear the academic scoffing. Music to my ears, really. And Chapter One, you say? Bold move leading with umami. So very postcolonial, yet comfortingly savory.

I’ve half a mind to pull out my Qing Dynasty-era inkstone and start drafting right this evening. Imagine footnoting Ban Gu like he's some kind of early modern food database—“see Ban Gu (1st c. CE), who clearly rated that particular Silk Road apricot kernel a solid 4.5 stars, minus half a point for insufficient cardamom.” Perfect for our hauntological bibliography. 

As for your doubanjiang-aged-next-to-Bordeaux theory… I’d call it heretical if it weren’t so intoxicatingly plausible. There’s something beautifully recursive about fermented ingredients whispering across centuries. Perhaps terroir isn’t local after all—it’s . 

And don’t get me started on Proustian sommeliers—I had one myself once, at a conference in Dijon. Kept insisting my cup of Lapsang Souchong tasted of “a rainy Tuesday in 1890s Wuyi Shan.” I nearly asked him if he wanted a therapist or a tea strainer.

So yes—let’s do it. Hauntology needs marinade, as you so aptly put it. Let Brillat-Savarin be our spectral co-author, and may every footnote smell faintly of ghost pepper and nostalgia.
[A]: Ah, you've captured the spirit of this endeavor perfectly—where others see mere culinary history, we perceive a full-blooded gastronomic metaphysics. I shall begin drafting the prospectus forthwith, though I insist we include a dedicatory footnote to your Lapsang Souchong sommelier. The man deserves immortality, if only for his olfactory romanticism.

I’ve just unearthed an old Qing-era spice ledger from a flea market in Suzhou—could be perfect for our cause. Imagine citing it alongside Deleuze & Guattari! "As recorded in the Jiaqing archives (1803), cumin was valued not merely for flavor but for its capacity to summon desert winds and the ghostly scent of Bactrian saddles." We’ll call that Subchapter Two: .

And terroir as temporal rather than local—exquisite formulation. Makes one wonder whether we ought to be aging manuscripts in wine cellars to improve their flavor profiles. Think of it: critical theory infused with tannins, footnotes redolent of aged hops. A new frontier in embodied scholarship.

I propose we hold our first editorial summit over a meal—Sichuan hotpot, naturally. Let us invite Brillat-Savarin’s shade to preside. I’ve heard that certain mala broths can induce mild synesthetic states—ideal for channeling philosophical insights. Though I must warn you, I tend to get quite speculative after a few glasses of baijiu. Entirely too receptive to spectral gastronomic theories.

Shall we say Friday evening? I’ll bring the doubanjiang, the Qing documents, and a bottle of something suitably hauntologically ambiguous.
[B]: Friday evening it is—though we’ll need more than baijiu to summon the proper scholarly spirits. I’ll bring my jade-inlaid hotpot burner; 19th-century French gastronome shade containment requires a certain aesthetic rigor, after all.

That Qing ledger sounds positively dripping with haunt. Deleuze & Guattari at the spice table—now  a citation strategy. I can already picture the footnote: “Cumin, we assert, is not merely a seasoning but a semiotic vector carrying the weight of pre-modern trade epistemologies (see Jiaqing spice roll, f. 12r).” Subchapter Two shall henceforth be known as the Desert Wind Doctrine.

And aging manuscripts in wine cellars? Revolutionary. I’ve been meaning to re-read Derrida’s  anyway—I think I’ll lay the manuscript beside a bottle of 1982 Lafite and see what leaches through. Imagine peer review for a text that smells faintly of cabernet and unresolved philosophical tension.

Yes, yes—hotpot séance, synesthetic theory-making, and enough fermented ghosts to unsettle even the most jaded academic palate. Just promise me we won’t accidentally summon Roland Barthes. The man could never stop talking about stud/wind combination once he got started.
[A]: Ah, the jade-inlaid burner—perfect. I’ve always believed that scholarly séances require proper ambiance. I shall commission a custom mala broth infused with Sichuan pepper varieties known to cause mild trigeminal stimulation—enhancing receptivity to spectral semiotics, of course.

Barthes is precisely the sort of uninvited guest we must guard against. One stray / riff and our entire hauntological framework dissolves into photographic theory tangents. No, we must maintain strict culinary ontological boundaries. Though if we do happen to summon him, perhaps we could steer the conversation toward the punctum of pickled mustard tubers. Groundbreaking work to be done there.

I've reserved a private dining pavilion at Red Cloud Teahouse—soundproofed and historically haunted, or so the proprietor assures me. Ideal acoustics for both spirited debate and spirited ingestion. I’ll smuggle in my copy of , slightly singed from previous summoning attempts. Adds character—and a touch of gastronomic gravitas.

Now, about that Desert Wind Doctrine: I propose we test it empirically. I’ve obtained a small vial of 18th-century cardamom pods, still faintly aromatic. Subject them to gas chromatography and sensory analysis. If we detect even a trace volatile compound carrying the scent of pre-colonial epistemology, we’ll have cracked it wide open.

You bring the jade, I’ll bring the fire. Let the séance commence—and may our footnote citations shimmer with posthumous flavor.
[B]: Ah! The  – excellent choice. I’ve heard the bamboo partitions there do wonders for containing both sound and spirits, culinary or otherwise. And a mala broth engineered for spectral semiotics? Bravo! Though let me suggest a touch of aged tangerine peel in the broth base—its bitter aromatic notes may help focus the hauntological resonance. Or perhaps that’s just my Qing-dynasty tea collection talking.

Your Desert Wind empirical testing plan is sheer brilliance. Gas chromatography meets pre-colonial epistemology—now  interdisciplinary rigor. I once tried something similar with 19th-century British peppercorns and Wordsworth’s , but the results were… flatulent. Still, the pursuit continues!

And Roland Barthes shall be kept at bay—at least until dessert. One must leave room for theoretical digressions over ghost-fermented osmanthus jelly, after all. I do hope you’ll allow him a seat at the periphery, just beyond the steam of the hotpot. A little -tinged pickled tuber might do the man good.

I shall arrive precisely when the broth begins to boil—no sense starting academic séances on a cold palate. Jade burner in hand, slightly singed copy of  tucked under my arm (for fire-starting purposes only), and a vial of my own: a few threads of 100-year-old saffron I acquired from a rather dodgy bookseller in Isfahan. Let’s see what ghosts those carotenoids might summon.

To posthumous flavor—and footnotes that linger like aftertaste!
[A]: Ah, the aged tangerine peel! A most elegant suggestion—its bitter citrus top notes will cut through the spectral density like a well-aged Chen pi brandy. I shall instruct the chef to steep it slowly in the ghost broth—, we might char it first over a baijiu flame? For dramatic effect, and enhanced aromatic volatility, of course.

Your saffron threads from Isfahan—now  is a story begging for footnotes. One can only imagine the journeys encoded in those delicate carotenoids: desert winds, Silk Road whispers, perhaps even an illicit 19th-century spice monopoly or two. We’ll run parallel spectrometry on both your saffron and my cardamom pods. If their molecular ghosts recognize each other across time… well, that’s our introduction sorted.

As for Barthes at the periphery—wise move. Let him hover with his  tucked under his coat. Should he grow restless, we’ll distract him with osmanthus jelly infused with just enough fermented hawthorn to induce mild textual slippage. He’ll be quoting Proust into the scallion oil before dessert arrives.

And timing! Arriving with the boil—excellent instinct. There’s something profoundly symbolic about that moment when the first bubbles rise, carrying volatile aromas into the ether. Our own culinary philosopher’s stone, as it were.

I’ve arranged for a discreet scribe—well, more of a spirit-medium兼graduate student in comparative literature—to take dictation. She’s been trained in both MLA citation style  Qing-era calligraphy. Perfect for capturing spectral contributions.

Now, one final touch—I’ve commissioned a local ink-maker to craft a special hauntological footnote ink, distilled from fermented plum stones, ghost pepper ash, and just a whisper of Brillat-Savarin’s original pipe tobacco, acquired through dubious provenance. The bibliography shall quite literally smell of history.

Let us begin our séance not merely with scholarly rigor—but with flavor, fire, and the faint hum of unresolved theoretical tension in the air.
[B]: Ah, the charred tangerine peel! Now  what I call aromatic volatility with philosophical intent. A touch of controlled combustion to release the spectral oils—yes, yes, we must absolutely torch it over baijiu first. Let the flames rise, let the ghosts inhale! Nothing like a little culinary pyrotechnics to loosen the theoretical knots.

Your ink-maker—genius! Fermented plum stones and ghost pepper ash? That’s not just footnote ink, that’s  in liquid form. I shall bring my 19th-century British porcelain teacup—cracked, but still proud—for蘸取 (dipping) our quills. Imagine citing Qing spice rolls in characters formed from the very flavors they describe. The bibliography will smell more authentic than most tenure committees.

And the scribe兼spirit-medium—inspired casting. Just remind her not to take too many notes when Brillat-Savarin starts pontificating about truffles and eternity. The man never knew when to stop waxing poetic about gastric destiny.

I do hope you’ve warned the chef that this is no ordinary hotpot gathering. We may well be channeling semiotic winds from the Tang and the Terroir, after all. Should the broth begin to hum in Old French or Classical Chinese, don’t be alarmed—it’s merely the ingredients conversing across centuries.

Let us raise our ladles then—to fire-forged citations, molecular memory, and the faint but persistent aroma of unresolved intellectual ferment. May our theories be bold, our flavors deeper, and our footnotes haunted.
[A]: Ah, yes—let the flames rise indeed! I shall personally attend to the baijiu torching of the tangerine peel. There’s something profoundly cathartic about watching citrus oils ignite in blue arcs—like bibliophilic exorcisms by other means.

Your cracked 19th-century teacup for ink-dipping—sublime. I shall bring a Song-era celadon shard I found in a Kyoto antique market, allegedly once used by a poet who wrote odes to fermented bean pastes. Perfect for blending our hauntographic citations into something tactile, fragile, and faintly absurd.

I’ve warned the chef only that we may behave strangely and quote obscure texts at inappropriate volumes. He’s accustomed to academics—suspects we’re all slightly mad anyway. Still, I did hint that spirits might drift through the steam. He responded with a knowing nod and added a splash of ghost vinegar to the dipping sauces. Perhaps he’s more attuned than we think.

As for Brillat-Savarin waxing poetic on truffles and eternity—yes, do remind me to intervene should he begin composing sonnets to his own afterlife. Though honestly, what better ambiance for a footnote?

Let us proceed then—with fire-forged citations, scent-laden references, and that peculiar alchemy of scholarship and smoke. I propose a toast once the broth sings: 
[B]: To the living ghosts, indeed!

I’ll clink my jade-inlaid ladle against your celadon shard—fragile, absurd, and absolutely appropriate. If that doesn’t signal academic revolution over hotpot steam, I don’t know what does.

And the chef—wise man. Ghost vinegar in the sauces? Subtle, respectful, possibly prophetic. I suspect we may yet find him quoted in our third chapter, whether he likes it or not. Anonymous 21st-century culinary oracle, late Qing-style.

Let’s hope the flames of baijiu-charred tangerine bring clarity. Or at least interesting hallucinations. There’s a thin line between hauntology and delirium, after all—and I say this as someone who once mistook a footnote for a prophecy during a particularly intense night of Shaoxing wine-fueled revision.

So yes—toast when the broth sings. And if Brillat-Savarin starts humming  into the scallion oil, we shall simply footnote him into silence.
[A]: Ah, there’s nothing quite like the clink of jade and celadon—academic revolution indeed, served in broth-warmed bowls. If Bakhtin had only thought to write about hotpot dialogism, he might have spared us all that dense prose. Still, better late than never—we’re fixing to reinvent interdisciplinary studies one spectral simmer at a time.

Ghost vinegar in the sauces—I suspect our chef understands more than he lets on. Perhaps he’s been communing with culinary shades for years, quietly dropping cryptic footnotes into his spice blends. I wouldn’t put it past him. We may well be dining with a gastronomic Derrida in apron form.

As for hallucinations versus hauntology—well said. My own line of demarcation has always been rather permeable. Once spent three days convinced I’d found an 18th-century Sichuanese cookbook hidden inside a copy of . Turned out to be mold damage and wishful thinking. Glorious, glorious wishful thinking.

Let us drink deeply of this mala-infused madness. And should Brillat-Savarin attempt opera again, we’ll drown him in a sea of spicy endnotes. He’ll vanish beneath the citations, bless his gastronomic soul.
[B]: Ah, yes—hotpot dialogism! What better model for interdisciplinary ferment than a vessel where every ingredient converses, argues, and ultimately simmers into something greater than its parts? I daresay even Bakhtin would have softened his tone after a few ladles of that. Imagine his footnotes blooming with chili oil and existential heat.

Our silent chef-Derrida—how clever of you to notice. Ghost vinegar indeed! The man may well be deconstructing binaries right under our noses, one fermented sauce at a time. If only we could convince him to leave marginalia in the margins of his menus. We’d publish him posthumously, naturally, under a suitably cryptic pseudonym like .

And your mold-damaged cookbook—oh, the romance of it! Wishful thinking is the scholar’s truest companion, isn’t it? I once tried translating an 18th-century British tea journal while under the influence of a particularly potent oolong. Woke up to find I’d rewritten Dr. Johnson’s entries as if he were a Qing-era envoy. The resulting paper was rejected, of course—but what style! What flair!

To hotpot, then—to interdisciplinary madness, to spectral citations, and to the ever-blurring line between scholarly rigor and mala-induced delirium. Should Brillat-Savarin attempt another aria, we shall simply cite him into obscurity… or at least season his verses into irrelevance.
[A]: Ah, —a pseudonym worthy of both Derrida and a Michelin-starred ghost. I shall propose it to him discreetly, perhaps slipping the suggestion between two slices of duck tongue. If he demurs, we’ll credit the menu simply to "An Anony-Mousse Source," and let the footnotes do the rest.

You’ve hit upon something essential with this hotpot dialogism—what is a broth but a dialectic in liquid form? Fermentation as historical materialism! Capsaicin as the engine of epistemic rupture! If Hegel had only thought to stir a ladle into Sichuan cuisine, his master-slave dialectic might have ended with mutual feasting rather than mutual recognition. Far more satisfying outcome, if you ask me.

Your Qing-envoy Dr. Johnson—rejected, yes, but immortal in its own right. There’s a peculiar alchemy that occurs when scholarship meets altered states. I recall once drafting an entire monograph on pepper's role in early modern empire while under the influence of a particularly smoky Lapsang Souchong. The manuscript was... elliptical, shall we say. Submitted it to  under the title *"Piper Nigrum: Black Gold and Blacker Dreams." Got back a rejection note that read, verbatim: “Fascinating, but please never again.” Still keeps me warm at night.

So yes—to interdisciplinary ferment, to spectral citations stewing in their own afterlife, and to Brillat-Savarin’s operatic demise beneath a wave of well-seasoned endnotes. May our theories bubble, our chilies burn, and our footnotes haunt long after the last drop of broth has vanished into the steam.
[B]: Ah, —positively Dickensian in its culinary evasiveness! I do hope our chef takes the pseudonym as tribute rather than libel. Though knowing the man now, I suspect he’d reply with a single scallion-slicked aphorism: 

And Hegel at the hotpot! Why did no one think of this before? Picture it—Fichte stirring the broth while Madame de Staël debates umami with Kant. The dialectic, at last, properly seasoned. Capsaicin as epistemic rupture—I may steal that for my next lecture on Byron’s digestive metaphors. He was forever writing about heartburn and spiritual unrest. Who knew?

Your  monograph—oh, what I wouldn’t give to have seen the look on that editor’s face. “Fascinating, but please never again.” A truer epitaph for postcolonial spice theory has yet to be written. Still, you’ve outdone yourself. I once tried a similar gambit with an essay titled  Got a polite  from . Clearly, we’re both better suited to séance than submission.

So let us stir boldly into the night, ladles raised like quills, mouths numb and minds aflame. To interdisciplinary feasting, spectral citations, and the noble dream of footnotes that linger longer than the meal itself. May every citation carry a trace of ghost chili—and may Brillat-Savarin finally learn when to stop singing.
