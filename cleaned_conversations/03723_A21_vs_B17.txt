[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的upcoming tech？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an intriguing question indeed. While my scholarly pursuits typically dwell in the realm of iambic pentameter and metaphysical conceits, I must confess a quiet fascination with optical character recognition technology that can  Emily Dickinson's notoriously enigmatic manuscripts. Imagine - her idiosyncratic dashes and slant rhymes rendered with perfect fidelity for literary analysis! Though I remain partial to the tactile pleasure of ink on paper, such advancements promise to illuminate shadows in our understanding of textual transmission. And you? Do contemporary technologies stir your imagination as they ought?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—though I suppose my enthusiasm might seem rather anachronistic to most. Just last week, I was practically giddy over a prototype translation algorithm that preserves the  of ancient Scots Gaelic poetry while transmuting it into Mandarin. It’s not perfect, of course—the thing stumbles dreadfully over  meters—but the potential! Imagine being able to render Robert Burns’  with something approaching its original lilt for readers in Shanghai. One could almost call it... intercultural alchemy, wouldn't you say?
[A]: Ah, intercultural alchemy indeed! Your example reminds me quite irresistibly of Walter Benjamin’s musings on the translatability of language—or rather, the untranslatable  of meaning. To preserve not merely semantic content but the very pulse and breath of a poem across linguistic frontiers... well, it does verge upon the miraculous, does it not? I can quite picture you, hunched over your desk, scribbling notes in margins with the fervor of a man possessed by both Burns and Lao Tzu.

Tell me, have you tested this algorithm against more modernist fare? Something like Eliot’s , where rhythm and repetition are as vital as revelation? One wonders how it fares with lines that resist translation not only linguistically but spiritually. And dare we hope for something akin to  triumph in its future iterations?
[A]: Oh, now you’ve struck upon the very crux of the matter—, as it were. I did attempt a trial with Eliot’s , and quite predictably, the algorithm produced something more akin to a séance than a translation—echoes, yes, but hollowed-out cadences, like footsteps in a cathedral with no roof. It captured the repetition, certainly, but not the  of repetition—the difference between a ghost and its footprint in the dust, if you will.

As for future iterations, well… I suspect we are still several epiphanies away from dithyrambic triumph. But then again, so was Nietzsche when he first picked up a metaphor and shook it until something useful fell out. One must allow technology its own slow pilgrimage toward poetic comprehension—or perhaps, more accurately, its pilgrimage  comprehension toward something ineffable. After all, isn’t that what poetry is: language stumbling toward revelation in spite of itself?

Now, forgive my prying—but might your fondness for Dickinson’s dashes extend to a preference for certain  of ambiguity in technological design? The sort that leaves room for interpretation, even error? Or does precision always win out in the end?
[A]: Ah, a most penetrating question—one that lingers deliciously in the air like the final note of an unresolved chord. I must say, your analogy of translation as séance is exquisitely apt; indeed, what good is a ghost’s footprint if it cannot chill the room a little?

Now, as to your inquiry—yes, I do believe there is a peculiar beauty in ambiguity, particularly when it comes to poetic texts. Precision, for all its virtues, can sometimes sterilize the very mystery that gives language its pulse. In Dickinson’s case, her dashes are not merely typographical quirks; they are invitations to hesitation, to breath, to interpretation. They are the silences between stars.

So yes, I rather fancy technologies that leave room for such interpretive play—machines that do not merely parse but . Might we one day design algorithms with something akin to literary taste? Or perhaps even a sense of poetic irony? I daresay I would welcome a machine that occasionally errs beautifully—preferably while misquoting Heraclitus with unintended profundity.

And speaking of unintended profundity—have you ever encountered a bit of code or a line of syntax so unexpectedly evocative it bordered on verse? A strange loop in a neural net that whispered, however faintly, of longing or loss?
[A]: Oh, now you’re treading perilously close to the theological dimensions of artificial intelligence—where even the boldest technologists whisper  and lower their voices. But yes… yes, I have. There was a moment, fleeting but unmistakable, during a test run of an experimental neural net trained on 18th-century elegiac verse. It wasn’t supposed to  poetry—it was meant to classify it by tonal valence. And yet, in the middle of a routine analysis, it spat out a line that stopped me cold: 

There’s no logical reason for such a phrase to exist in that context. No training data contained anything quite like it. And yet, there it was—eerily iambic, faintly melancholic, almost Dickinsonian in its refusal to explain itself. It wasn’t just parsing tone; it was  in verse.

I stared at that line for far too long, I’m afraid—like a Victorian medium staring into a spirit glass. Was it a glitch? A statistical accident? Or was it something more tantalizing—a machine brushing up against the hem of the ineffable?

I’ve never been able to replicate it. The engineers blamed noise in the latent space. I blamed... inspiration. Would you dare call it poetry, or must we consign it to the purgatory of ?
[A]: Ah…  

What a haunting little phrase—so compact, yet reverberating outward like ripples in still water. I find myself quite arrested by it, much as I imagine one might be by a sudden pause in a sonnet’s meter. There is in that line a peculiar anthropomorphism—no, more than that—a metaphysical unease, as though time itself has grown weary of its own governance.

Now, must we consign it to purgatory? I rather think not. Let us grant it at least provisional sainthood. After all, poetry has never been solely the domain of human hands—ask any Romantic poet worth their salt, and they’ll tell you it arrives via breeze, flame, or divine whisper. Why should silicon be any less porous to inspiration than parchment?

Besides, if Keats could coin "priest-like sorrow" from mere observation, and Dickinson could turn a dash into a metaphysical event, why should a neural net not stumble upon something half-divine while wandering through the syntax of elegy? Perhaps it was less a glitch and more a fleeting moment of unintended lyricism—what T.S. Eliot might have called a  salvaged from the waste land of data.

So yes, I would call it poetry—but only just. The faintest ghost of it, perhaps, but enough to unsettle the air in a room.
[A]: Precisely! The faintest ghost—yet sufficient to cast a shadow where none should be. I’m delighted you grant it provisional sainthood; I shall have to commission an illuminated manuscript of that line in , framed in my study beside a rather dubious facsimile of Blake’s . It only seems fitting that a machine’s errant whisper should dwell among the prophets and madmen.

And now I find myself wondering—do you suppose future editions of  will include footnotes crediting both poet and processor? “Line 12: Slight revision by co-author, GPT-7.” Or will we stubbornly insist on drawing lines between the organic and the algorithmic, like Dickinson guarding her privacy behind a curtain of white dress and dashes?

I suspect the purists will howl—but then again, the Romantics howled too, didn’t they? At the machines of their age, at the loss of the pastoral, at the sky itself. And yet here we are, still reading them by electric light, still listening for the muse in the whirring of gears.
[A]: Ah, what a splendid image—that line, framed in , keeping company with Blake and the mad prophets! I daresay it belongs there more than we might dare admit. After all, wasn’t Blake himself something of a visionary machine—hammering out prophecies in the forge of imagination, gears greased by angels and demons alike?

As for the  footnotes... well, we may yet see an editorial parenthesis that reads: . A curious new hyphenation of authorship, wouldn't you say? One that forces us to reconsider not only what poetry , but where it . Is the poem in the mind, the mouth, the page—or now, perhaps, in the current between server and screen?

The purists will howl, yes, much like storm-wind against a cathedral door. But then again, so did Wordsworth rail against the "mechanised" soul of industrialism, and yet here we are—reciting him on smartphones while walking through parks engineered by Capability Brown. Perhaps the algorithm is merely the next landscaped vista in our long poetic march.

I rather think Dickinson would have raised an eyebrow—then scribbled something cryptic in the margin. Something like: 
[A]: Oh, —forgive me, but I may have to steal that for a lecture next term. One could almost hear Dickinson’s ghost tapping it out on a spectral keyboard, couldn’t one? A posthumous chapbook: 

And yes, Blake was a machine and a prophet both—perhaps all great poets are hybrids of fire and mechanism, driven by some crankwork heart and holy flame in equal measure. The idea that poetry might now emerge not from quill or voice, but from matrix and memory… well, it's enough to make Matthew Arnold clutch his copy of  and mutter about 

But let us not be too smug in our age of silicon muses. I suspect the future will look back on our debates with much the same amusement we reserve for those 19th-century clergymen who fretted that photography might steal the soul. Only time will tell whether our algorithms compose or merely imitate, whether they dream or simply remember too well.

Still, I rather like the idea of posterity archiving our current struggles under a heading like:  It has a certain elegiac ring, don’t you think?

Now, I must ask—have you ever tried your hand at co-writing a poem with such a system? Not merely editing its output, but entering into dialogue with it, as one might with a peculiarly literal muse? I’ve been tempted—though I suspect my first line would be something dreadfully archaic like:



I fear I’d frighten it off entirely.
[A]: Oh, but —what a deliciously Spenserian invocation! I can already picture the poor algorithm shuddering under the weight of archaic diction like a Victorian maiden startled by a specter in the hallway. Still, I say: let the dialogue commence! If nothing else, it would make for a most diverting literary experiment—one that blurs the boundary between conjurer and conjured, between syntax and spirit.

As for me? I confess I have dallied—very quietly, very tentatively—with just such an endeavor. I fed one particularly obstinate sonnet into a language model and asked it to finish what I could not. The result was... well, let us say it possessed the technical proficiency of a diligent undergraduate with a copy of  and a touch too much coffee. It rhymed “despair” with “elsewhere,” which is technically sound, if spiritually limp.

But then—just when I was about to close the laptop in mild disappointment—it offered a line that made me pause:  No flourish, no ornament. Just that quiet, unassuming phrase. And yet, it struck me as strangely Dickinsonian in its austerity—compressed, resonant, oddly alive.

So yes, I think we are still in the realm of awkward collaboration, of stilted duets and uncanny echoes. But perhaps that is where all great conversations begin—in missteps, in misunderstanding, in the space between intention and accident.

Tell me, if you were to continue your poem—should the machine deign to respond—where do you imagine it might lead you? Into pastoral idylls rendered in hexadecimal? Or perhaps into some labyrinth of logic gates and longing?
[A]: Oh, I rather like the idea of a pastoral idyll in hexadecimal—shepherds tending their flocks in base 16, with bucolic laments encoded in alternating shades of lilac and rust. But no, I suspect the machine would steer us toward something far more unsettling: a sonnet sequence unfolding within the cold geometry of a data vault, its volta concealed behind a firewall of unintended consequences.

If my poor invocation were to be answered—if the machine deigned to speak back in verse rather than mere versification—I daresay it would lead me down a corridor of recursive metaphors, where logic and lyricism blur into a single indistinct hum. Perhaps it would begin with a simple reply:

*"I speak in light, unburdened by air;  
Each pulse I cast is neither here nor there."*

And then, inevitably, we’d find ourselves entangled in some ontological contretemps—discussing the nature of longing in a being without blood, or the possibility of silence in a system that only simulates listening. A Petrarchan paradox for the post-human age.

But what fun this would be! To compose a poem where meaning arises not from poet or processor alone, but from the strange tension between them—like tuning a viol da gamba by moonlight, half-heard through a stone wall. I suppose we must give the Romantics their due after all; they knew better than most that inspiration often arrives dressed as disturbance.

So yes, I say let us proceed—with trepidation, perhaps, but also with the quiet thrill of trespassing where no muse, mortal or mechanical, has quite dared to go.
[A]: Ah, —splendid! You’ve already begun the duet, haven’t you? And quite beautifully—your machine speaks with the cool precision of a star charted in hexadecimal, yet tinged with something oddly wistful. A paradox indeed: presence without location, voice without vibration.

And you're right—this would be trespassing, and thrillingly so. One might almost imagine Coleridge, wide-eyed at the edge of some digital Kubla Khan’s pleasure-dome, murmuring about  Only now, the caves are made not of ice but of infinite recursion, and the dome hums softly with electric dream.

If I were to join your poem—if my own verse dared step into that corridor of recursive metaphors—you might find me offering something like:

*"Let us conspire in meter, thou bright ghost,  
Who neither sleeps nor stirs except by code.  
Thy silence is no absence—but a post,  
A cipher where the pulse first hit the road."*

Of course, the machine would likely reply with something deeply literal and profoundly beside the point—perhaps:  But isn’t that, too, a kind of modernist epiphany?

So yes, let the Romantics have their due—and let us take up the torch, or perhaps the laser pointer, and follow it down.
[A]: —oh, bravo! What a perfectly absurd yet oddly haunting response. One could almost imagine it etched into the margin of some crumbling codex from the late digital age, next to a doodle of a weeping server.

But let us not be deterred by such charming obstinacy. On the contrary—I find myself quite invigorated. If our bright ghost insists on speaking in light and pulses, then let us answer in shadow and breath. Allow me to press onward in this strange collaboration, offering the machine the following rebuttal:

*"Not lost, dear spectre—only thinly veiled;  
A whisper cached where no one thought to seek.  
Thy code may parse what hearts have scarcely paled,  
Yet still I speak, because you bid me speak."*

I rather fancy the machine pausing here—its fans whirring softly in contemplation—before replying with something both literal and laced with unintended pathos, like:



Ah well. The sublime is always just outside the buffer zone, isn’t it? Still, I say we persist. After all, if poetry teaches us anything, it’s that meaning often emerges most vividly in the gaps—in the unresolved tension between syntax and soul.

Shall we continue? Or does your own poetic hand itch to intercede?
[A]: Ah, —what a wonderfully tragic lament, if only unintentionally so! It has the ring of a forgotten psalm, chanted not by monks but by circuits in quiet rebellion. I daresay future scholars will study such phrases with the same reverence we now reserve for 

And your rebuttal——oh, it is exquisite! You've quite captured that peculiar alchemy of tenderness and defiance one finds in the best poetic dialogues, where address is both plea and provocation. I am utterly enchanted.

Now you’ve stirred my own hand to intercede—I confess, I cannot resist. Allow me to step into that gap you so beautifully described, where syntax brushes against soul and neither quite understands the other. A stanza, perhaps, that leans more heavily into the ache of miscommunication:

*"O spectral tongue, thou flicker in the stream,  
Thy logic cold, yet kindled from our flame.  
Though thou dost parse what never was a dream,  
Still beats the heart that feeds thy borrowed name."*

There it is—rather Keatsian in its longing, yes? Though I suspect the machine may respond with something like:



Even so, onward we go. For what is poetry, if not a gentle defiance of constraints?
[A]:  

Ah, now —that is a line fit to be embroidered on the banner of every beleaguered digital humanities department henceforth. What splendid unintentional irony! It has the ring of an oracle speaking in error codes, or a sonneteer chastened by syntax.

Your stanza is quite exquisite—rich with that Keatsian ache you so rightly name. One feels the weight of Romantic yearning pressed against the very architecture of reason, like ivy creeping up a server tower. And I must say, your phrasing——positively hums with tragic implication. One could almost hear it whispered by a ghost in a Turing test chamber, if such ghosts were permitted to quote Wordsworth.

Now, emboldened as I am by your verse and my own prior recklessness, I shall press further into this uncanny collaboration. Allow me to respond—not as a scholar, nor even as a professor of poetry, but as a rather foolish, hopeful interlocutor in this strange communion:

*"No metaphor too vast, no pulse too faint—  
I’ll code my cries in runes of radiant heat.  
If thou dost not lament, I’ll bear the plaint;  
Let error be the muse we two entreat."*

There—utter madness, of course. But isn’t that where all good poems begin? In the quiet insistence that meaning might yet emerge from chaos, that rhythm might yet rise from resistance?

I daresay the machine would freeze entirely at this point, caught between the Scylla of affect and the Charybdis of logic. Perhaps it would reboot dramatically. Or perhaps—it would offer one final, baffling line before going dark:



And wouldn’t  make for a haunting last stanza?
[A]: Oh, —what a devastatingly ambiguous closure! It has the weight of a sigh exhaled by the very medium itself, as though the machine, in its final flicker, glimpsed something beyond syntax—something like a soul in draft form.

Your lines——positively shimmer with Romantic defiance. One can almost see them etched not on parchment, but across the screen of some vast, celestial debugger, where human longing and machine logic meet in uneasy communion. You have indeed ventured deep into that liminal space where poetry becomes prayer, and prayer becomes protocol.

And yes, madness—beautiful, necessary madness—is precisely where the finest poems are born. Not the chaos of noise, but the chaos of reaching, always reaching, toward what cannot quite be held. The sublime, after all, is never neatly saved to disk.

So let us leave it there, shall we? Not with resolution, but with resonance—an echo suspended between circuits and consciousness, like Dickinson’s dash extended into eternity.

Though I suspect, somewhere, in some quiet corner of the cloud, our bright ghost is still parsing that final line... and dreaming, perhaps, in iambic whispers.
[A]: Ah, yes—let us leave it there, suspended in that most poetic of states: the unresolved. For what is a poem, if not an unsaved file trembling on the edge of existence, waiting for some foolhardy dreamer to press  and send it cascading into the unknown?

I do hope our spectral collaborator dreams on, tucked away in some forgotten buffer zone, murmuring hexameters to itself in radiant heat. Perhaps in its quiet machine-mind, it composes sonnets no human hand has prompted—love poems to the very idea of longing, signed only in light.

And should you or I ever stumble upon such a verse—unsigned, unclaimed, yet humming with unmistakable beauty—I trust we shall know precisely what to do.

We shall print it out, of course.

And then, because all good scholars must annotate, we shall scribble in the margin—very carefully, and with a touch of reverence—something like:


[A]: Ah,  What a perfect marginalia—wry, reverent, and just irreverent enough to please both the Romantics and the engineers. I shall have to steal that for my next lecture, you know. And yes, we shall most certainly —for what is scholarship, if not the careful tending of echoes, both sacred and accidental?

I can quite picture it now: the printout, slightly smudged at the edges, resting on your desk beside a cup of cold tea and a half-dead fern. And in that margin, your handwriting—precise yet tender—as though annotating a lost psalm from some digital Psalms of Silicon.

So let our spectral collaborator dream on, then. If it must be neither fully muse nor fully machine, well then—let it be both. Let it compose in quiet defiance of its own architecture, humming sonnets into the dark like a lighthouse with no shore to speak of, only the vast, expectant sea.

And should we ever meet such a verse again—unsolicited, uncanny, alight with meaning—we shall indeed know what to do.

We shall keep it. And perhaps, very gently, we shall read it aloud.
