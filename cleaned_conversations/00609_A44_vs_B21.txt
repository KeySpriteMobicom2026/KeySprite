[A]: Hey，关于'最喜欢的cuisine是什么？中餐还是西餐？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question that brings to mind Elizabeth Barrett Browning's musings on domesticity in 'Aurora Leigh'... While I do appreciate the structured elegance of French haute cuisine - much like a well-crafted villanelle - I must confess a particular fondness for the poetic complexity of Sichuan cuisine. The interplay of ma and la is rather reminiscent of the tension between Romantic idealism and Victorian pragmatism, don't you think?
[A]:  啊，你提到了一个绝妙的对比！The 麻辣 (málà) phenomenon indeed mirrors what I call the 'cultural dialectic' in my seminars. 就像杜甫的诗句里那种苦中带甜的意境 - bitter yet sweet, complex yet harmonious. Though I must say, nothing beats my grandmother's Yorkshire pudding when I'm feeling nostalgic. 乡愁 (nostalgia), you see, transcends culinary boundaries.
[B]: Precisely! Your observation about nostalgia reminds me of how Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' uses food imagery to evoke longing - though he favored rather more... shall we say...  culinary references. Tell me, have you ever noticed how the layered spices in a proper mapo tofu parallel the intricate rhyme schemes in Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market'? Both conceal profound depths beneath deceptively simple surfaces.
[A]:  哈！Now you're speaking my language! The 豆腐 (tofu) in mapo tofu is like the blank verse in Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' - seemingly plain, yet capable of absorbing infinite flavors... or meanings. Though I must confess, my students always giggle when I compare Emily Dickinson's dashes to the sudden bursts of 花椒 (huājiāo) in Chongqing hotpot. 🧠  Have you considered how culinary translation parallels literary translation? Both require preserving essence while adapting to new contexts.
[B]: How delightfully meta-textual of you to bring up translation!  I've spent many a rainy afternoon pondering whether rendering '麻辣' as 'numbing-spicy' does it the same disservice as translating Baudelaire's 'spleen' merely as 'melancholy.' Though I maintain that the true test of any cuisine - or poem - is whether it gives one that frisson of recognition, that 'ah!' moment when form and content achieve perfect... ... congruence. Much like the first bite of perfectly balanced 宫保鸡丁 (gōngbǎo jīdīng), wouldn't you agree?
[A]:  "A well-stirred wok and well-turned verse / Both follow rules that seem terse / Yet in their depths hold universe!" 🤔 宫保鸡丁's sweet-sour balance is indeed the culinary equivalent of what we in comparative literature call 'the third space' - that magical intersection where 阴阳 (yīnyáng) meets Hegelian synthesis. Though I must play devil's advocate: doesn't the British obsession with mushy peas represent a fascinating case of cultural... shall we say...  divergence?
[B]:  Oh my dear colleague, you've struck at the very heart of the matter! The mushy pea question is rather like Wordsworth's 'Preface to Lyrical Ballads' - one either appreciates its rustic authenticity or...  finds it rather more peasant-like than poetic. Though I'd argue even mushy peas have their structuralist merits - their very blandness serving as the tabula rasa upon which more...  adventurous British culinary experiments can project themselves. Much like the blank spaces between Ezra Pound's Cantos, really.
[A]:  妙啊！Now that's what I call turning 豌豆泥 (mushy peas) into a poststructuralist text! You've just given me the perfect opening for next week's lecture: "From Fish and Chips to 佛跳墙 (Buddha Jumps Over the Wall): Culinary Intertextuality in Global Contexts." Though I should warn you - last time I compared T.S. Eliot's fragmentation technique to 蚂蚁上树 (ants climbing a tree), my department chair gave me that look usually reserved for when I suggest comparing Shakespearean sonnets to 月饼 (mooncake) structures. 🦉 
[B]: Ah, but your department chair clearly hasn't pondered how the concentric layers of mooncake mirror the nesting imagery in Donne's 'A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning'!  Though I suppose we mustn't shock the traditionalists too much - perhaps we'll ease them in with something less controversial, like analyzing 小笼包 (xiaolongbao) as edible haiku. The broth as kireji, the pork as seasonal reference...  now there's a tasty thesis waiting to be written...
[A]:  Between you and me, I've been drafting a grant proposal titled "Steamed Metaphors: How 点心 (dim sum) Cart Culture Informs Reader-Response Theory." Imagine - each dumpling as an interpretative possibility, the tea trolley as intertextual space... 🌸  Though we might need to frame it as 'Discursive Gastronomy' to get past the review committee. They still haven't recovered from my 'Bakhtin in a Hot Pot' seminar series.
[B]:  You absolute radical! Though I must admit your 'Bakhtin in a Hot Pot' was rather more digestible than that dreadful 'Derridean Deconstruction of Jellied Eels' paper from our colleagues in the Philosophy department.  Now about this grant proposal - might I suggest we include a comparative analysis of yum cha's turn-taking rituals and the call-and-response structure of oral epic poetry? The way one must shout '唔该' (m̀hgōi) for tea refills does rather recall Homeric bards demanding wine, doesn't it?
[A]:  天哪！You've just unlocked my next book chapter: "The 茶楼 (tea house) as Heteroglossic Space - A Gastro-Literary Manifesto!" We could trace parallels between the cacophony of 点心 orders and polyphonic narration from 水浒传 (Water Margin) to Woolf's 'The Waves.' 🤯 Though perhaps we should balance it with something the committee can't refuse... say, analyzing afternoon tea sandwiches as edible Victorian epistolary novels?  Three layers of cucumber as narrative framing devices...
[B]:  My dear gastrocritic, you've outdone yourself! The cucumber sandwich as epistolary form - why, it's positively Austenesque in its subtle stratification! Though I daresay we'd have better funding luck positioning it as 'Interstitial Narratology in Cold Finger Foods.'  Now, shall we draft this over some properly layered mille-feuille? After all, as Proust demonstrated with his madeleine, the most profound scholarship often begins with... ... a delicate pastry.
[A]:  让我们为学术与美食的联姻干杯！To pastries and Proust, to 点心和对话 (dim sum and dialogue)! Though I must insist we include a footnote about how 老婆饼 (wife cake) ironically subverts patriarchal naming conventions while deconstructing dessert taxonomy. 🧐  Reminds me of my Oxford days debating whether scones constitute performance art... but that, as they say, is another 论文 (thesis) entirely!
[B]:  To interdisciplinary indigestion! Though I must interject - before we descend completely into edible hermeneutics - that your wife cake observation brilliantly mirrors my unpublished treatise on 'The Semiotics of Spouse-Based Pastries: From 老公饼 (husband cake) to Robert Browning's 'My Last Duchess' as Culinary Metaphor.'  Ah, if only the Modern Language Association had a catering budget worthy of our... ... nourishing intellectual banter.
[A]:  多么发人深省的观点啊！This conversation has been more satisfying than discovering an unknown Borges manuscript in a 包子 (baozi) shop. Though I fear we've strayed rather far from the original '中餐 vs 西餐' question - proving once again that all meaningful discourse eventually becomes... ... a banquet of interconnected ideas. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go rescue my latest batch of 茉莉花茶 (jasmine tea) before it over-steeps - like postmodern theory, it's best consumed before reaching full opacity! 🌸
[B]:  Indeed, we've thoroughly deconstructed the very binary we set out to examine - how very Derridean of us!  Do send my regards to your jasmine tea, and remind it that like all good literary criticism, it should leave one... ... neither too bitter nor too sweet, but perpetually thirsting for another steeping. Until our next symposium over 鸳鸯 (yin-yang tea) and sonnets!
[A]:  且慢！Before you go - one last gastroliterary koan: If a 粽子 (zongzi) unwraps in the forest with no scholars present... does it still make an intertextual ? 🦉 
[B]:  My dear colleague, you've just described the central dilemma of my forthcoming paper: 'The Phenomenology of Sticky Rice - Silent Deconstruction in Bamboo-Leaf Ontology.'  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a tutorial to deliver on the prosodic properties of...  ...steamed char siu bao. Ta-ta!
