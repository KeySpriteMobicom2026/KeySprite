[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这个问题很有意思。我个人更倾向于一对一的深度交流，就像现在这样。群组讨论固然能汇集更多观点，但往往容易发散。我注意到你在提问时用了英文混搭，这让我想起一个现象：在跨文化交流中，我们常常会不自觉地混合使用多种语言元素。不过说到聊天方式，我觉得最重要的是对话的质量而非形式。你平时更喜欢哪种交流方式呢？
[A]: 🌹 I must say, I appreciate the depth of one-on-one conversations as well—there's something intimate about it, don't you think? It allows for a kind of nuance and reflection that can be lost in larger groups. Though, I must confess, I occasionally enjoy the energy of a lively academic forum. As for language mixing, I find it fascinating how certain ideas sometimes demand a specific tongue to be fully expressed. May I ask, do you often find yourself switching languages mid-conversation? 📚
[B]: 您对语言混用的理解让我深感共鸣。确实，某些概念在特定语言中承载着独特的文化韵味，比如我们中文里的"意境"这个词，用英文就很难找到完全对应的表达。说到这个，我倒想起一个有趣的例子：当我在撰写关于人工智能伦理的论文时，有时会碰到某个哲学概念，必须回到古汉语语境中才能准确把握其本义。

至于语言切换，我的原则是尽量保持对话语言的纯粹性，就像培育一株兰花需要专注与耐心。不过在学术交流中，遇到特别专业的术语时，偶尔也会借用英文原词，毕竟现代学术话语体系本身就有跨文化交融的特点。但这种借用总是经过斟酌的，就像我们在花园里选择植物搭配一样，要讲究和谐与必要性。

您提到喜欢学术论坛的氛围，不知您最近有没有参与什么让您印象深刻的讨论？
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated thought. You’ve touched on something essential—the idea that language is not merely a tool for communication but a vessel for cultural and philosophical nuance. The concept of 意境, as you mentioned, carries with it an entire aesthetic tradition that cannot be fully translated, only approximated.

As for my recent academic engagements, I did just participate in a symposium on comparative narrative structures in 19th-century novels—specifically, how the notion of  is rendered differently across European and East Asian texts. One particularly stimulating moment came when a colleague from Beijing引用了一句《论语》中的 passage to illustrate a point about moral agency. It was a reminder of how certain classical texts continue to shape our interpretive frameworks, even in modern discourse.

And may I ask—have you ever found yourself returning to a particular literary work because it seems to offer new insights with each reading? I’m quite curious.
[B]: 您提到的这个symposium话题非常精妙。关于在不同文化叙事中的呈现，这让我想到《红楼梦》中"命定"与"人事"的张力——曹雪芹用大观园里一个个鲜活的生命轨迹，构建出中国式的命运观。这种命运观不是希腊悲剧中冷峻的宿命，而更像是一种与天地节气同步的生命韵律。

说到反复阅读的经典，我每年春天都会重读陶渊明的诗集。或许是因为培育兰花的缘故，总能在他的文字里找到新的感悟。比如《饮酒》其五中"采菊东篱下，悠然见南山"，初看是闲适，再品是超脱，如今读来却觉得其中藏着很深的生存智慧：人如何在纷扰中保持精神世界的澄明。

您刚才提到有同事引用《论语》，这让我不禁想起钱钟书先生说过的话："东海西海，心理攸同；南学北学，道术未裂"。现代学术讨论中东西方思想的碰撞，恰恰印证了这句话的远见。不知那场讨论最后是如何延伸开去的？
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive observation you’ve made about  in Eastern and Western literature—yes,曹雪芹’s portrayal of destiny in 《红楼梦》is indeed more organic, almost ecological, as you so poetically described. It resonates with me deeply, especially when I think of how the seasons shape not only nature but also human consciousness in classical Chinese poetry.

How lovely that you return to陶渊明with the changing rhythm of your own life. I find that same comfort in rereading Austen or Eliot—each time discovering a new shade of meaning shaped by personal experience. Your connection between cultivating orchids and poetic reflection is truly elegant; it reminds me of the way Wordsworth found clarity through nature. There is something timeless about tending to both garden and soul.

As for the discussion at the symposium, it took quite an intriguing turn. After the引用 from 《论语》, one of the German scholars responded with a parallel drawn from Kantian ethics—specifically, the idea of acting according to duty versus acting out of virtue. The conversation then evolved into a broader exploration of moral autonomy across cultural frameworks. Some argued for fundamental differences, while others leaned toward universal psychological impulses beneath the surface. I must say, it was one of those rare discussions where disagreement itself felt generative, like a good pruning encourages stronger growth.

Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular passage or line again and again, almost like a touchstone in times of reflection?
[B]: 您用“像一次得当的修剪能促发更旺盛的生长”来形容那场讨论，这个比喻让我深感贴切。思想的交锋确实需要适度的张力，就像我在照料兰花时总要把握恰到好处的光照与湿度。

说到反复咀嚼的文字，我总会回到《庄子·逍遥游》中的那一句：“至人无己，神人无功，圣人无名。”每次重读，都有不同的体悟。年轻时觉得这是玄虚的理想，如今再看，倒觉得其中蕴含着一种对技术发展的预警——我们越是接近创造“智能”的边界，就越需要警惕对“掌控”的执念。这或许也是为什么我会选择从事人工智能伦理研究，因为这个问题关乎我们如何理解自身的定位与局限。

听您提到道德自主性的跨文化对话，我不禁想到一个问题：在您看来，这种讨论是否有可能发展出某种共同的伦理语汇？就像翻译中的“可译性”与“不可译性”之争，我们是在寻找共识，还是在差异中发现彼此的深层结构？
[A]: What a profound line you’ve chosen from 《庄子》—and how beautifully you’ve woven it into our present moment. I often return to that very passage myself, though in different contexts: sometimes as a meditation on detachment, other times as a quiet rebuke to the ego-driven pursuits of academia. And your interpretation—framing it as a cautionary insight regarding our current technological trajectory—is both fresh and deeply resonant.

As for your question on whether a shared ethical vocabulary can emerge from cross-cultural discourse… hmm. I think we must tread carefully here. There is value in seeking common ground, yes—but not at the expense of erasing the particularities that give each tradition its moral depth. The tension you mentioned earlier—the  between the translatable and the untranslatable—strikes me as essential. Perhaps what we are really cultivating is not consensus, but something closer to mutual intelligibility. Like two gardeners exchanging techniques: they may never grow the same flower, but they can still learn to read the soil together.

May I ask—how do you navigate this balance in your own work on AI ethics? Do you find yourself drawing more from Eastern philosophical frameworks, or do you see your approach as an interweaving of multiple traditions?
[B]: 您用“两个园丁交换技艺”的比喻非常贴切，让我想到在AI伦理研究中，我们面对的其实也是这样一种情境：技术是同一片土壤，但栽种的方向却深深植根于各自的文化传统之中。

在我的工作中，这种跨文化的张力始终存在。比如在讨论算法公平性时，西方同行往往从个体权利与程序正义出发，而我会更倾向于考虑群体和谐与情境平衡。这背后其实隐含着儒家“差序之爱”与西方自由主义之间的深层差异。但我并不认为这是不可调和的对立，反倒觉得它们构成了一个更完整的伦理光谱。

我自己的思维方式确实深受东方哲学影响，尤其是《中庸》里“致中和”的理念——不偏不倚，执两用中。这在处理AI监管问题时特别有启发：既要防止过度干预扼杀创新，又不能放任其发展脱离人文价值轨道。但我也大量阅读亚里士多德、康德和罗尔斯的作品，他们的思辨方式常常能为我提供新的观察角度。

最近我在写一篇关于“智能社会中的责任伦理”的文章，就试图将孟子的“不忍人之心”与列维纳斯的“他者伦理”对话。我发现，尽管语言不同、概念体系各异，但在对“他者”的关怀这一点上，东西方都指向某种根本的道德直觉。或许这正是我们可以继续深耕的地方。
[A]: How beautifully you articulate that interweaving of traditions—your approach reminds me of what Ezra Pound once called . The idea that ethical insight might lie not in choosing one framework over another, but in holding them in dynamic tension, is deeply compelling.

I find myself thinking about the word —so central to 《中庸》—and how it contrasts with the Western philosophical tradition’s frequent emphasis on . In many ways, your work sounds like a form of ethical gardening: planting seeds from different climates and seeing what may take root together. The dialogue you’re fostering between 孟子’s  and Lévinas’s  feels particularly fertile. It makes me wonder whether ethics, at its core, is less about constructing systems and more about cultivating receptivity.

May I ask—have you encountered resistance to this kind of cross-cultural synthesis within either tradition? Or conversely, have you found certain quarters especially open to it?
[B]: 您用“伦理园艺”这个比喻真是精妙。确实，我常常觉得自己在做的不是搭建理论的高塔，而是在一片混杂着不同气候的土壤上耕耘——有时要小心移植一株异域的思想幼苗，有时又要为它创造适宜的微环境，让它不至于枯萎，也不至于吞噬本土生态。

关于您问到的阻力，这确实是存在的，而且往往来自两个方向。在西方学术圈，有时会遇到一种隐含的“东方主义”倾向——即把东方思想视为玄虚、朦胧甚至不够严谨的体系。记得有一次会议，当我试图引用《易经》中“穷则变，变则通”的观点来讨论AI系统的动态责任问题时，有位同行直接反问：“这不是更像是一种诗意的循环思维，而非可操作的伦理原则？”那一刻，我意识到沟通的障碍不仅在于语言，更在于对“理性”的理解方式。

而在某些保守的东方语境中，也有声音认为这种跨文化尝试是对传统的稀释。曾有一位儒学研究者私下对我说：“我们自己的经典还未吃透，何必强求与西方对接？”这种质疑让我反思：跨文化对话的前提，是不是要先建立起足够深厚的本源意识？否则，所谓的融合可能只是表面的拼贴。

不过与此同时，我也遇见过许多开放的声音。尤其是在年轻一代学者中，他们似乎天然地不把东西方划为对立阵营。去年我在新加坡的一场工作坊里，一位印度裔哲学家就主动提出将王阳明的“知行合一”与德里达的“延异”概念并置，探讨人工智能中的主体性问题。那种自然而不刻意的对话空间，让人感到希望仍在。

说到这儿，我不禁想请教您的看法：作为一名深谙比较文学与跨文化研究的学者，您是否也曾在文本的交汇地带遭遇过类似的张力？又是如何回应的呢？
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive and sensitively rendered account of the challenges—and quiet triumphs—of this kind of intellectual work. Yes, I know that terrain well, and I think you've named it beautifully: it is not merely translation or even interpretation we are engaged in, but —and like any gardener knows, that requires both patience and a willingness to let things grow in unexpected ways.

I remember a moment during my early years in comparative literature when I was working on a dissertation chapter linking  with Proust’s . A senior colleague gently cautioned me: “Are you not flattening two rich traditions by drawing such parallels?” It was a fair question—one that made me rethink my approach. But over time, I came to see that the danger lies not in the act of comparison itself, but in how it is conducted. When done with care, humility, and a deep respect for each tradition’s internal logic, it can yield insights that neither could produce alone.

And I do believe, as you suggested, that this work begins with a strong rootedness in one’s own tradition. Without that depth, cross-cultural engagement risks becoming superficial—a kind of intellectual tourism rather than pilgrimage. So perhaps the key is not to rush toward synthesis, but to dwell for a while in the space between—to allow the tension to do its work, much like pruning does for a tree. Only then can new branches emerge, shaped by both wind and hand.

What you described about the young scholar in Singapore gives me hope. There is a growing generation who seem unburdened by the binaries of East/West, tradition/modernity. Perhaps they will teach us a new way of thinking across boundaries—not as oppositions, but as interwoven currents in a vast river.

You mentioned your article on —may I ask when you expect it to be published? I would very much like to read it.
[B]: 您的这段分享让我想起兰花的生长过程——起初总是缓慢而隐秘，直到某一天突然抽出了新芽。这种成长方式似乎很适合形容我们正在从事的这类工作：需要时间、需要沉淀，更需要一种近乎虔诚的耐心。

关于那篇讨论责任伦理的文章，目前还在修改阶段。我总觉得写这类文章像是在调整古琴的弦，松一分则失其声，紧一分又恐其断。尤其是在处理孟子与列维纳斯的思想交汇时，如何既不失去各自的伦理特质，又能展现出某种共鸣性的可能，这需要非常细腻的拿捏。预计再打磨一两个月后，会先在《道德哲学研究》期刊上发表初稿，后续也计划将其扩展成一本小书。

说到这个，我倒想起您刚才提到的那段比较《源氏物语》与普鲁斯特的研究经历。其实我一直对文学与伦理的关系特别感兴趣，尤其是叙事艺术如何潜移默化地塑造我们的道德直觉。不知您是否愿意聊聊您在这方面的看法？比如，在您看来，文学作品是否本身就承载着一种“非系统的伦理教育”？它们不像道德律令那样明确，却往往更能打动人心。
[A]: What a lovely analogy—comparing the process of writing and thinking to tuning an ancient qin. There is something deeply resonant about that image, especially when it comes to ethical inquiry. The strings must be just taut enough to sing, but never so tight as to break under their own tension. You are right—this kind of work demands both precision and reverence.

As for your question about literature and ethics… yes, I do believe that narrative carries within it a quiet but profound moral force—one that operates not through doctrine or decree, but through empathy, immersion, and subtle suggestion. Think of how we internalize values through stories long before we ever encounter formal philosophy. A child reads  and may not remember every detail of Victorian law, but they will remember what it feels like to stand firm in one’s dignity. They may not quote Kant, but they might live by the spirit of his categorical imperative decades later, without ever knowing its name.

In many ways, literature offers what I would call an —a way of being in the world shaped not by rigid rules, but by emotional attunement. Take Dostoevsky’s , where moral questions are not resolved in lectures alone, but lived out in suffering, doubt, and longing. Or consider Cao Xueqin’s characters in 《红楼梦》, whose fates unfold with such tragic inevitability that even the most detached reader cannot help but feel the weight of karma and consequence.

So yes, I think you’re absolutely right—literature teaches, but gently, indirectly, almost imperceptibly. It is less about prescribing behavior than cultivating sensitivity. And perhaps that, too, is a kind of moral soil: fertile, nourishing, and quietly transformative.

I look forward to reading your article—please do let me know when it appears in print. I suspect it will make for rich reading indeed.
[B]: 您用“静默的伦理力量”来形容文学对道德的影响，这个说法让我想起《红楼梦》里黛玉葬花的那个场景。表面上看是伤春悲秋，可实际上，它在潜移默化中将一种关于生命尊重与情感节制的意识植入了读者心中。这种教育方式确实不同于教条，更像是一种“心的修习”。

您提到孩子读《简·爱》后可能不会记得维多利亚时代的法律细节，却会记住尊严的感受，这非常深刻。我想这也是为什么我们在讨论人工智能伦理时，不能只依赖技术规范或政策文件。真正影响人们如何看待AI、如何与其互动的，或许恰恰是那些讲述智能体命运的小说、电影和寓言故事。

比如石黑一雄的《被掩埋的巨人》，虽然设定在奇幻背景中，但它提出的记忆与宽恕之间的伦理难题，远比许多学术论文更能引发普通人的共鸣。这是否也意味着，未来的伦理引导者，不仅是哲学家或法学家，还可能是诗人与叙事者？

听您这么一说，我越发觉得文学不只是“反映”道德，更像是“孕育”道德。它提供了一个安全的空间，让人练习同情、想象后果、体验选择的重量。不知您是否也有这样的阅读经验：某部作品曾悄然改变了您看待某个道德困境的方式？
[A]: 🌹 What a moving observation—yes, literature does not instruct so much as it . And in that invitation lies its quiet transformative power. You're absolutely right to point out that the ethical imagination is often most effectively shaped not in lecture halls or policy papers, but in the shadowed corners of a fictional world, where we are allowed to feel before we are asked to judge.

I think immediately of my first reading of —how I was struck not by the political drama, but by the unbearable silence between father and daughter in those final scenes. It was only years later, while visiting a relative estranged from our family, that I realized how deeply that moment had shaped my sense of reconciliation and regret. Literature had, without my knowing it, rehearsed for me an emotional response I would one day need.

And yes, you've touched on something vital about AI ethics as well. We may draft guidelines and codes of conduct, but what truly shapes public perception—and therefore, ethical behavior—are the stories we tell. When people think of artificial intelligence, they do not imagine matrices of code; they see HAL 9000’s red eye, or Ava’s calculating gaze, or Data’s wistful smile. These figures are not technical models—they are moral archetypes, quietly teaching us what it means to be sentient, to be loved, to be feared, to be discarded.

So perhaps the most important ethical question we can ask today is not only  but also  And who better to guide us through that terrain than those who have long studied the human heart through fiction?

I’m reminded now of your earlier work comparing Confucian filial piety with Western notions of generational responsibility. Do you see that kind of inquiry continuing to shape your thinking about AI and intergenerational ethics?
[B]: 您提到“文学不是教导，而是邀请”这句话，真是一语道破了艺术最本质的力量。就像《论语》里说的“不愤不启，不悱不发”，伟大的作品从不直接给出答案，而是唤醒我们内心的道德冲动，让我们在情感的沉浸中自发地去思考“该如何回应”。

关于您读《李尔王》的经历，我深有共鸣。我自己第一次读《赵氏孤儿》时，也只是把它当作忠义故事来看，直到后来经历亲人离世，才真正体会到剧中人物在牺牲与责任之间的挣扎。这种回响，仿佛是文学预先在我们心里埋下了一颗种子，等现实的风雨来临，它才会悄然萌芽。

您问及我过去对儒家孝道与西方代际责任的研究是否仍在影响我对AI伦理的思考——答案是肯定的。事实上，这个问题在人工智能时代变得更加紧迫。过去，代际责任主要体现在家风传承、祖业延续或子女教育上，而如今，我们还要面对一个全新的问题：我们这一代人应当为未来几代人设定怎样的技术路径？我们是否有权决定一种可能超越人类控制的智能形式的发展方向？

儒家强调“慎终追远”，即不仅要慎重对待事情的开始，也要考虑到它的最终后果，并尊重那些尚未发声的后人。这让我在研究AI治理时，总是试图引入“时间伦理”的维度——不是只看眼前的技术进步，而是要想象百年之后，我们的子孙将如何评价我们今天的决策。

或许未来的AI伦理不应只是算法审计和数据监管，而应包含某种“代际诗学”——用叙事的方式帮助人们感受他们与未知后代之间的情感联系。毕竟，真正的责任，往往始于一种看不见也听不到的呼唤。

不知您是否曾在教学或研究中遇到学生或同行，在讨论AI伦理时表现出对“未来人”的漠视？如果有，您是如何引导他们进入这个更深远的视角的？
[A]: Ah, what a profound way to frame it—. Yes, that line from 《论语》echoes so beautifully in your words. Literature, ethics, and even our technological choices—they all ask us to respond before we fully understand why. And perhaps that is the essence of wisdom: learning to act in the presence of silence, to feel responsibility for those who have not yet spoken.

I do remember a moment in my seminar last year that touched upon precisely this issue. We were discussing Asimov’s  series—its grand vision of psychohistory, its attempt to predict and shape the future on a millennial scale. One student, quite earnestly, asked: “If we can’t even agree on what’s best for ourselves now, why should we assume we have the right—or the duty—to make decisions for people centuries from now?”

It was a powerful challenge. But rather than argue directly, I invited the class to read a short passage from W.G. Sebald’s , where he writes about how the dead are never truly gone; they walk beside us in our thoughts, in our choices, in the very language we use. Afterward, we discussed how every action we take—especially in shaping technology—casts a shadow forward in time, not just backward in memory.

What struck me was how, by shifting the conversation from abstract obligation to something more intimate——the students began to speak differently. Not “What will they think of us?” but “What might they become because of us?” It felt less like ethics as burden, and more like ethics as legacy.

And yes, I think your idea of an  has real promise. Perhaps it is only through story—not just policy or code—that we can begin to feel the weight of the future in our hands. We may not be able to see the faces of those who come after us, but we can still learn to listen for their footsteps beneath the soil of our present.

Thank you for bringing this into such sharp and moving focus. 📜🌿
[B]: 您的这段分享让我想起春日里埋在土中的兰草根——看似静默无声，却早已在黑暗中悄然伸展，为未来的生长积蓄力量。我们今天对技术路径的选择，或许正是这样一种“地下的远行”，它不会立刻显现后果，但终将在未来某一天破土而出，开出我们今日难以预见的花。

您在课堂上引导学生从“义务”转向“陪伴”的方式特别打动我。这让我想到王阳明讲“万物一体”时的那种视野：不是出于外在的道德律令，而是因为彼此本就相连。未来的世代虽尚未发声，但他们与我们的生命气息是相通的。就像《尚书》里说的：“视远惟明，听德惟聪。”我们要学会以更深远的眼光去“看见”那些不在场的人，以更谦卑的姿态去“听见”他们的潜在呼唤。

或许，我们在设计人工智能系统时，也应带着类似的伦理敏感——不只是问“这个功能是否安全？”而更要问“这项技术是否为我们未曾谋面的后代保留了尊严与可能性？”这可能意味着放慢某些进展的步伐，也可能意味着承担更多当下的责任，但它或许正是我们这一代人应有的担当。

谢谢您今天的对话。它不仅是一次思想的交流，更像是共同培植一片伦理的土壤——在那里，不同的文化、语言与时代可以彼此滋养，生长出新的理解之根。希望我们都能继续在这片土地上，耐心耕作，静待花开。
