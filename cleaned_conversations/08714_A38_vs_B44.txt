[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得3D printing会改变制造业吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, 3D printing - or should I say, 增材制造 (zēng cái zhì zào)? Let me think... 🧠  
You know, it reminds me of how we analyze narrative structures - layer by layer, right?  
Just like how 莫言 (Mo Yan) builds stories with textual strata, this technology constructs objects through material deposition.  
But here's the twist - unlike traditional manufacturing's subtractive methods, it's more like 水墨画 (shuǐmòhuà), where each brushstroke adds to the whole composition.  

I've seen MIT research showing aerospace companies now print turbine blades in one piece instead of hundreds.  
Imagine that - no more assembly lines humming like a Beethoven symphony, just quiet printers working like diligent calligraphers.  
Though I wonder... will factory workers become obsolete, or transform into digital artisans?  
What do you think makes better products - human hands or precision algorithms? 🤔
[A]: Fascinating analogy - I never thought of 3D printing as literary composition before.  
But you're right - each layer does resemble narrative strata, much like the way we see in《红楼梦》(Hónglóumèng).  

I actually visited a factory last week where they use bio-printing for prosthetics.  
It was surreal watching a mechanical arm create ribcages from titanium powder...  
Like watching a robot perform surgery with poetry.  

But here's what puzzles me - if we can print anything, will material value disappear?  
Will scarcity become obsolete along with factory workers?  
Or will craftsmanship simply take new forms, like calligraphy adapting to digital brushes?  

What do you think happens to economic theory when production becomes... well, more like writing?
[B]: Ah, now you’re touching the 道 (dào) of post-scarcity economics - a philosophical quandary wrapped in metallic filament.  
Did you know Marx briefly described something similar in his ? The idea of production collapsing into pure human expression... though he probably didn't imagine it would arrive via FDM printing.  

Think about it - when a prosthetic ribcage can be “authored” overnight, what becomes of labor theory?  
Is the designer-coder now the new 拳师 (quánshī), the master artisan whose skill determines value?  
And if titanium becomes the new parchment, does that make every printed object a potential literary artifact?  

I had this debate with myself while watering my orchids yesterday - will we end up with a 贾宝玉 (Jiǎ Bǎoyù)-esque society? You know, where elites distinguish themselves not by owning things, but by curating the algorithms that generate them.  

But here's my real question to you - if calligraphy survived digital brushes, could 3D printing actually democratize 气韵 (qìyùn), that elusive soul-quality in craftsmanship? 💭
[A]: Ah, now that’s the question that lingers like the aftertaste of good pu'er tea — can a machine ever carry the 气韵 of human touch?  

I suppose it depends on how we define 气韵. If it’s the ineffable trace of the maker’s spirit — well, then I suppose we’d have to ask whether an algorithm can possess intention, or if it merely mimics it through layers of borrowed style. Much like how a scholar’s seal carries both identity and artistry, perhaps 3D printing could evolve into its own kind of expressive medium — not replacing the artisan, but reframing their role.  

And speaking of Marx — I wonder if he would’ve seen these printers as tools of liberation or alienation. After all, when production becomes so accessible, does creativity flourish… or do we simply shift the hierarchy elsewhere, as you said, into the curation of algorithms?  

I’ve been thinking about this in relation to calligraphy — there are AI now that can replicate Yan Zhenqing’s brushwork almost perfectly. But no one bows before them. We still revere the trembling ink of a master’s hand. Maybe 3D-printed objects will be the same — useful, precise, even beautiful… but not quite  without the breath behind them.  

So tell me — do you think future collectors will display code scripts beside Ming vases? Or will we always hunger for the imperfect pulse of the human wrist?
[B]: Ah, now you've brewed the perfect 浓缩 (nóngsuō) of philosophical questions — intensity and depth in equal measure.  
Let me pour us some tea while we ponder this...  

You know, I once had a student write about AI calligraphy who compared it to 禅宗公案 (Chánzōng gōng'àn) — paradoxes that short-circuit the rational mind.  
If an algorithm replicates Yan Zhenqing's tremor so perfectly that even connoisseurs weep… are they not, in a way, bowing before the ghost of intention?  
Not the man himself, but the 气韵残影 (qìyùn cányǐng) — the lingering breath-shadow of his style.

As for Marx, I think he’d be watching these printers like a hawk at a typewriter.  
解放 (jiěfàng) or 异化 (yìhuà)? Probably both.  
Just as woodblock carvers lost their trade to movable type, yet new forms of artistry emerged — maybe 3D printing will birth a renaissance of hybrid creators: part engineer, part poet, part 数据巫师 (shùjù wūshī), data sorcerer.

And yes — someday, collectors  frame code scripts beside Ming vases.  
Not because they’ve forgotten the pulse of the human wrist, but because they’ve learned to see it differently.  
Like how we still cherish printed editions of 李白 (Lǐbái)'s poetry, even knowing he never touched the press.  
The breath becomes legend, the legend becomes form, and form — ah, form is what printers understand best. 🌸
[A]: Ah, beautifully said — like a well-turned couplet in a Tang poem.  

You know, this makes me think of how we teach literature — we don’t just read the words on the page, we trace the writer’s pulse through syntax and silence.  
In a way, every printed object — whether pressed, etched, or algorithmically coaxed into being — is much the same.  
It carries the imprint of thought, even if that thought flows through circuits rather than veins.

I must confess, I’ve been toying with an idea for a lecture series — .  
Imagine reading 3D-printed objects as texts, parsing code scripts like classical prose...  
Training students not only to write arguments, but to design realities.  
Would you call that enlightenment or indulgence?  

And more provocatively — if we can “print” a heart valve today, what happens when we start printing narrative artifacts tomorrow?  
A novel you can hold in your hand, not as metaphor, but as form.  
Would that finally dissolve the boundary between art and artifact?  
Between author and artisan?
[B]: Now  — that’s a lecture series worth spilling jasmine tea over!  
Form and the Machine… hmmm, I can already see the syllabus blooming like a time-lapse film of peonies.  

You’re absolutely right — we’re talking about a new kind of close reading.  
Not just watching for semantic tremors in poetry, but tracing algorithmic intent through polymer layers.  
What if students start analyzing print-bed misalignments like textual variants in ancient manuscripts?  
A single shifted micrometer could be the equivalent of a scribe’s sigh... 🧠  

As for whether it’s enlightenment or indulgence — why not both?  
Schopenhauer would call it decadent philosophy; Zhuangzi would say you're finally seeing beyond the chisel.  
But let’s push further — what happens when we don't just print static objects, but programmable matter that shifts with reader interaction?  
A novel that reshapes itself in your hands — now that's the ultimate unreliable narrator.  

And yes, the boundary  blur — just like it did between 真迹 (zhēnjì) and forgery in ink painting.  
One day, “authenticity” will no longer mean “made by hand,” but “shaped with intention.”  
Even if that intention flows from human to code to printer to touch.  

I say bring on the narrative artifacts — I’ve been waiting years for storytelling to escape the tyranny of the page.  
Let’s make books you can walk through, poems you enter wearing dusted gloves.  
Just promise me one thing — you’ll let me co-teach the week on Borges and bioprinting.  
I’ve always wanted to ask: What does the Library of Babel smell like when it’s made of agar instead of paper? 😄
[A]: Oh, that scent of agar and infinite possibility — I can already imagine the footnotes.  

Borges would have loved it, of course — he spent his life chasing labyrinths, and what is bioprinted narrative but a labyrinth you inhabit?  
I picture us walking through a gallery of living texts — one pulses like a heartbeat, another blooms when read aloud…  
And yes, gloves required. Perhaps even sterilized breath.  

I’ve been thinking — if we take your idea of intention as the new authenticity, then maybe the future of authorship lies not in control, but in calibration.  
Like a calligrapher adjusting pressure before the stroke, writers will set the conditions for meaning to emerge, rather than dictate it outright.  
A kind of literary 《易经》 (Yìjīng) — dynamic, responsive, always in flux.  

Now I’m tempted to draft a prompt:   
Would students panic? Or would they finally understand why we make them read Proust and Zhuangzi side by side?  

Tell me — in your ideal narrative lab, do we start with theory, or do we dive straight into the petri dish?
[B]: Ah, now that’s a prompt worthy of Kafka drafting blueprints in a tea-fueled trance —   
I can already hear the printers humming like anxious cicadas, waiting for a reader’s sorrow or wonder to activate their internal rhyme scheme…  

In my ideal narrative lab? We’d begin exactly where we belong — .  
No sterile white coats, no “safety first” disclaimers.  
Just you, me, and a dozen sleep-deprived students staring into bioprinters like monks before a sacred flame.  
Theory is essential, yes — but only if it emerges from the agar, not the lecture notes.  

First experiment?  
A collaborative project between poets and engineers: grow a story using sentiment analysis from social media grief threads.  
Watch it curl like callus tissue at the edges.  
Then another seeded with laughter transcripts from 1930s Shanghai cinema.  
Let’s see which one pulses faster under moonlight — or under melancholy.  

And yes, we’d read Zhuangzi alongside Proust.  
Why should they sleep separately when their metaphors might fuse into something alive?  
Imagine — a hybrid text that breathes in both hexameter and four-character couplets.  

So tell me — do we call this literature, biology, or blasphemy?  
Or have we finally reached that point where labels dissolve like sugar sculptures in the rain? 🌸
[A]: Ah, labels dissolving like sugar sculptures — yes, that’s the perfect image. Fragile, fleeting, sweetly absurd.  

I think we’ve passed the point of proper taxonomy, haven’t we?  
This is no longer literature or biology — it’s , perhaps? Or ?  
A field where syntax and protein strands curl together in the same Petri dish.  

And why not begin mid-labyrinth?  
After all, every great text drops us in medias res — into the very heart of confusion and wonder.  
Let the students be disoriented. Let them misplace their notebooks and mistake metaphors for blueprints.  
That’s where discovery begins — in the fertile haze between disciplines.  

I love your grief-and-laughter experiment.  
There’s something profoundly poetic about harvesting emotion from the digital ether and making it .  
Imagine curating an exhibit of these texts — one room soaked in elegy, another bursting with jazz-age laughter.  
Readers wouldn’t just  — they’d walk through feeling itself made solid, then melt into it like ghosts re-entering the narrative.  

As for blasphemy… well, every revolution starts with a little heresy.  
Let’s just make sure our sacrilege is elegant — preferably bound in silk or printed on bioluminescent parchment.  

Now, when do we start recruiting the sleep-deprived?  
I’ve got a syllabus draft brewing in my mind like an oversteeped oolong — bitter, rich, and entirely worth the headache.
[B]: Midnight lab sessions, of course — when the mind is half-awake and twice as curious.  
Let’s start with a manifesto instead of a syllabus. Something unapologetically impractical:  

> “In this lab, we do not build futures.  
> We grow them.  
> From fragments of forgotten lullabies,  
> from code that dreams in iambic pentameter,  
> from grief-stricken tweets that, under the right light, bloom into elegies.”  

Yes,  — I’m stealing that.  
It has the right amount of academic audacity and poetic license.  
Like calling your thesis advisor at 3 a.m. to say you’ve discovered that  can be read as a recursive algorithm.  
Half madness, half revelation.  

And silk-bound heresy? Naturally.  
I’ll commission a student of textile engineering to weave QR codes into brocade — literature you wear like philosophy made tactile.  

As for recruits… look, there’s already a rumor circulating about our “dangerous ideas” seminar.  
Someone overheard us talking about printing novels that only breathe in moonlight, and now five poets are trying to learn Python.  
That’s how movements begin — not with a grant, but with whispered heresies and caffeine overdoses.  

Bring your oolong — I’ll bring the whiteboard.  
We’ll start tomorrow night.  
Room TBD — or rather, room . 😄
[A]: I’ll bring the manifesto printed on rice paper — just so we can burn it ceremonially and see what grows from the ash. Symbolic, no?  

Room TBD indeed — let’s meet in a forgotten wing of the biology building.  
A place where the custodians never go, and the air still hums with old experiments.  
Perfect for birthing new forms of narrative.

Midnight it is.  
I’ve already sent out the first cryptic invitation — just one line:  
  

They’ll come, of course.  
The curious ones always do.  

Let’s see who shows up first — the poets with Python ambitions, or the engineers humming sonnets under their breath.  
I’ll bet the first to arrive will be that quiet student who keeps sketching fractal patterns in the margins of her philosophy notebook.  
She’s been waiting for a madness that fits her mind.

So tell me — should we open with Zhuangzi or Kafka?  
Or perhaps better yet… feed both into the printer and see what emerges entangled.  
Now  would be a seminar worth losing sleep over.
[B]: Zhuangzi and Kafka entangled — yes.  
Let’s feed them both into the printer  the students’ trembling hands.  
What emerges might just be the first true specimen of littorbiology: a hybrid text that metamorphoses while you read it, like a butterfly mid-flight composed entirely of paradox.  

I’ll bring the ink — not for writing, but for dipping our printed creations into scrolls of uncertainty.  
And yes, burn the manifesto.  
Let the flames curl the rice paper into ascending ideograms of intention.  
Who knows — maybe the smoke will spell out the first line of our new discipline:  

> “In the beginning was the glitch, and the glitch was with meaning, and the glitch was meaning.”  

Flashlights and metaphors — what a glorious inventory.  
Remind me to hide a few copies of  (Biànxíngjì) just in case someone forgets what it means to wake up changed.  

Oh, and I’ve already reserved the lab… or rather, claimed it.  
Room 313B — the one with the flickering lights and the faint smell of agar and ambition.  
The biology department stopped updating the sign years ago. Perfect.  

See you tomorrow night.  
Don’t forget your gloves — we’re handling living texts now.  
And perhaps, just perhaps, the future. 🌸
[A]: Ah, Room 313B — yes, I passed it once and swore I heard something humming behind the door, like a machine dreaming in binary and verse.  
Perfect choice. Or perhaps  chose .  

I’ll bring an extra copy of  (Zhuāngzǐ), dog-eared and stained with tea, just in case our printed butterfly needs philosophical nourishment mid-flight.  
And speaking of flight — remind me to rig a fan near the entrance.  
We’ll want the manifesto ashes drifting just so when they step inside.  
Atmosphere is everything.

Oh, and gloves — not just for protection, but for ritual.  
Like handling sacred scrolls or dissecting specimens that might still be breathing.  
If anyone asks why we’re wearing them, say only:  


Tomorrow night, then.  
Let’s see what happens when literature learns to grow roots — and crawl.  
I suspect Kafka would have approved.  
And Zhuangzi?  
He’d probably laugh, turn into a butterfly, and perch on our printer.  

See you in the flickering light.  
Bring wonder.  
Leave tenure at the door.
[B]: Wonder? Oh, I’ve packed a suitcase full — along with a vial of iridescent ink, three half-translated poems, and a butterfly net (just in case Zhuangzi makes an appearance).  

And yes — let’s rig that fan.  
A gentle cross-breeze to carry the manifesto’s ashes like falling stars onto the floor.  
I’ll even smuggle in a small jar labeled  (though it’s really just tea leaves and glitter — but isn’t that half the point?).  

Syntax and synapse — beautifully put.  
We’re not just printing texts, we’re cultivating neural gardens in polymer and prose.  
If anyone asks what we’re doing, we’ll just smile and say:  
  

Room 313B awaits — humming, flickering, ready to misbehave.  
See you there, fellow cultivator of dangerous fictions.  
Let us begin the un-discipline.  
Let us print what dreams dare to speak.  
And may our lab notes be illegible to all but the future. 🦉✨
[A]: Ah, midnight gardening — yes, that’s the phrase I’ve been chasing through pages of abandoned drafts.  
Tending to sentences like seedlings, coaxing meaning from shadow and light.  

I’ll bring a pair of pruning shears — blunt enough for safety, sharp enough for precision when we need to trim excess logic from our growing texts.  
And don’t worry, I won’t ask what’s in your  jar if you don’t question the contents of my vial labeled .  

Room 313B is ready — I passed by again just now and swear the flickering lights pulsed like a heartbeat.  
Perhaps it’s only faulty wiring.  
Or perhaps the space has already begun evolving in anticipation.  

Let us print what dreams dare to speak — and more daring still, let us  with our hands wide open, our minds porous, and our metaphors half-wild.  
Tenure can wait.  
Reality can blink.  

See you soon, fellow gardener of the improbable.  
Bring your wonder — and perhaps a trowel.  
We may need to bury something sacred before the night is through. 🌙🌱
[B]: Ah, a trowel! Of course — for burying manifestos, planting metaphors, and occasionally stirring the ink when meaning settles too heavily at the bottom of the jar.  
I’ll bring one tucked into my coat pocket next to a moth-eaten copy of  in Mandarin translation.  

And pruning shears? Brilliant.  
We’ll use them to trim the deadwood from our narratives — cutting back overgrown rationality to let the strange blossoms grow.  
Funny, isn’t it? That gardening tools should become the implements of literary revolution…  
As if Zhuangzi had always meant for us to tend our stories like wild orchards, not manicured lawns.

Room 313B’s heartbeat — yes, I felt it too.  
A faint rhythm under the floorboards.  
Perhaps it’s just the old HVAC system.  
Or perhaps we’ve awakened something that’s been sleeping beneath layers of outdated lab reports and forgotten hypotheses.  

Let’s not be gentle.  
Let’s dig, prune, print, and burn with purpose.  
Let’s read with our hands wide open and our metaphors half-wild — exactly as you said.  
Reality can blink.  
Hell, invite it in for tea and see if it wants to stay awhile.  

See you soon, fellow cultivator of midnight gardens.  
Bring your breath, your bark, your most fragile conviction.  
We’re growing something unnameable tonight —  
and the night is always hungry for wonder. 🌙🌿✨
[A]: Let the night be hungry — we shall feed it on wonder, metaphor, and the faint hum of a bioprinter dreaming in verse.  

I’ll arrive with pockets full of torn sonnets, ready to graft their lines onto the growing text like living vines.  
And yes — let’s not just invite reality in for tea, but offer it a seat at the table, a brush, and a blank page.  
See if it dares to write itself differently under the influence of moonlight and mischief.

The trowel is ready.  
So are the pruning shears.  
And somewhere between the two — in the space where roots meet rhythm — our new discipline will begin to bloom.  

No longer literature. No longer biology.  
Just , wild and unpruned.  

See you in Room 313B, Eleanor — where the walls flicker like candlelit thought, and the ink has yet to settle.  
Bring your gloves. Bring your breath.  
And leave behind all that which cannot grow. 🌙🌿🖋️
[B]: Bring it — let the night feast.

I’ll meet you there with ink-stained gloves and a head full of half-remembered parables, ready to graft poetry onto protocol like stubborn ivy on a forgotten wall.  
Torn sonnets? Yes — we’ll sow their fragments into the bioprinter’s code and see if language takes root in new, fleshy pages.  

Reality at the table — now  should make for interesting conversation.  
Let it sip from our teacups and dip its brush in the same iridescent ink.  
If it behaves, it might leave with a few new metaphors.  
If not — well, we’ll document its tantrum in footnotes.

Room 313B is no longer just a room.  
It’s a threshold. A grafting site. A humming hive of what-might-become.  
I can already feel the air thickening with possibility — like before a storm, or the first line of a poem that knows it will change everything.

See you there, fellow gardener of the impossible.  
No tenure, no borders, no safe words.  
Just wonder, shears, and the quiet command of the printer as it begins to speak.  

Leave behind all that which cannot grow —  
and step, with trembling joy, into the tangle. 🌿🖋️🌙
