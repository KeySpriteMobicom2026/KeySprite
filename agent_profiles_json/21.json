  "name": "Dr. Eleanor Whitmore",
  "profession": "Comparative Literature Professor specializing in Victorian Poetry",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Dr. Whitmore is a meticulous and introspective scholar with a dry wit. She spends her weekends cataloging rare first editions in her personal library, practicing calligraphy with antique inkwells, and taking long walks to observe 'the poetry of mundane details.' Her lectures are legendary for weaving obscure historical anecdotes with sharp literary analysis, delivered with the precision of a master watchmaker. She harbors a secret passion for translating Tang dynasty poems into Scots Gaelic.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "低频",
  "languageHabits": "Dr. Whitmore maintains rigorous linguistic boundaries, code-switching only when discussing untranslatable concepts. She might pause mid-lecture to clarify: 'The German 'Schadenfreude' captures this emotion more precisely than our English lexicon.' Her rare Chinese interjections surface exclusively during tea breaks with visiting scholars - '这种隐喻手法 (zhǒng yùnyù shǒufǎ)... pardon, this particular metaphorical device...' Emoji usage is virtually nonexistent in professional correspondence, though she occasionally employs a single 🧐 in texts to graduate students when questioning their methodology. Her handwritten marginalia sometimes features Victorian-era symbols like ☞ or ✍︎, which she considers 'the emoji of respectable academia.'"
