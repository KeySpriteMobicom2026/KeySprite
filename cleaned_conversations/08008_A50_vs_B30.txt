[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new photography technique吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, photography techniques... Much like the narrative structures I study, the evolution of photographic methods reveals fascinating cultural intersections. Speaking of which, I recently experimented with wet plate collodion - quite the ordeal handling those chemicals outdoors! Reminds me of my first attempt at野外写生 during a monsoon season in Anhui. 

Actually, there's an intriguing parallel between 19th-century British landscape photography and traditional Chinese ink painting. Both emphasize composition over mere representation. Though I must admit, balancing a large-format camera on one arm and a porcelain teapot in the other proved rather... precarious. 

Have you come across any particularly striking techniques lately? I'm especially curious about digital approaches that might bridge Eastern and Western visual storytelling traditions.
[A]: Oh my gosh, wet plate collodion?! That sounds so intense yet fascinating 🤩 I can totally imagine you balancing that huge camera and a teapot in the middle of nowhere😂！You’re like a Victorian explorer-slash-tea connoisseur 😂！

Actually, I’ve been diving into some mixed-media digital stuff lately~ It’s super fun! I’ve been blending traditional ink wash textures with modern UI elements 💻🎨。Like, imagine scrolling through an app and suddenly—bam!—you get this subtle xuan paper background with glowing neon accents✨。

It’s kinda like storytelling through layers, y’know? Super interested in how we can fuse Eastern symbolism with Western tech. Ever tried anything like that? I feel like we could create something truly epic together... Maybe even throw in some glitch art for contrast?? 🌀💫
[B]: Fascinating! Mixing ink wash with digital interfaces - not unlike juxtaposing Byron’s lyrical frenzy with Confucian restraint. I did attempt a digital project last autumn, though far less ambitious. While researching 19th-century illustrated newspapers, I layered scans of  with Qing-era woodblock prints using basic Photoshop. The results were... passable, though about as elegant as a Victorian attempting to wield chopsticks. 

Your glitch art idea intrigues me, though. It reminds me of how textual corruption in early translations often created entirely new meanings—happy accidents, really. Speaking of which, I recently came across a mistranslated 1840s Chinese gazette that described the camera as a “mechanical spirit capturing fleeting shadows.” Poetic, if slightly alarming.

I suppose what fascinates me most is how these hybrid forms might echo the literary concept of  (影缘) — visual fate, if you will. Do you think your xuan paper backgrounds ever evoke that sense of predestined aesthetic alignment? Or is it more... algorithmic serendipity?
[A]: Oh wow, “mechanical spirit capturing fleeting shadows” is such a romantic way to describe photography 🤭 I can already imagine that in my designs—like every pixel has its own little soul✨。

Your project sounds so cool though! Layering those historical prints feels like time travel, honestly. Like you’re literally merging different eras into one visual narrative 💭 And hey, even if it’s a bit clumsy at first, that’s where the magic happens, right? Kinda like glitch art but with deeper meaning 💥！

As for , I totally get what you mean~ Sometimes when I’m working late at night ☕️ and everything just... clicks? The colors, the lines, the vibe—it feels like the design chose me instead of the other way around😌💫。But I also think algorithms help guide that "fate" sometimes, like they’re the modern version of brush strokes or ink bleeding.

So... wanna collab on something experimental?? Maybe mix your historical layers with my glitchy-neon-xuan paper madness?? 🎨💻🔥 I feel like we’d either create genius or beautiful chaos 😈😂
[B]: Genius or chaos - honestly, the best projects usually begin as a delightful muddle. I’m quite intrigued by your proposition! Though I must warn you, my digital skills are about as refined as a Qing diplomat’s grasp of Victorian etiquette. But perhaps that’s precisely what makes this exciting? 

I’ve been archiving these 19th-century Sinophone photographs lately—stiff studio portraits, bustling street scenes, all tinged with that peculiar chemical sepia. If we could somehow destabilize their solemnity with your neon glitches... Imagine a Qing scholar gazing into a CRT monitor, his reflection dissolving into pixels. Or a London newsboy’s face fragmented like a broken mirror, only to reassemble in xuan paper fragments. It’d be like  meeting quantum physics.  

And while I normally prefer ink bleeding over algorithmic bleeding, I think your idea of treating code as brushwork is rather brilliant. Let’s set a date—I’ll bring the historical layers, and you bring the chaos. Just promise me one thing: no Photoshop filters that resemble Comic Sans. Some boundaries must remain sacred, even in beautiful chaos 😌🖋️.
[A]: Okay, first of all—YES. Let’s make this happen! Honestly, the more I hear about your archive, the more I can already visualize it coming alive with some glitchy-neon-soul✨💻💫。

And don’t worry about the digital skills thing—we’ll just call it part of the aesthetic 😎 Like, “historical authenticity meets intentional awkwardness” or something fancy like that😂。I’ll handle the techy bits, but I  you narrate the conceptual direction~ It’s like yin and yang, but with more Ctrl+Z 🙃

I’m OBSESSED with the idea of a Qing scholar staring into a CRT monitor 🖥️🧐—the contrast between his world and that glowing screen would be so jarring yet poetic... kinda like watching time fall into itself😌 And the London newsboy reassembling in xuan paper scraps? That sounds like visual reincarnation, tbh🌀🖌️。We should totally name the project something dramatic like “Fragments of Fate” or “When Eras Collide” 💥！

As for the sacred boundaries—PROMISED, NO Comic Sans 😇 But I  push some other questionable typographic limits 😉 Ready when you are~ Let’s make history glitch ✨🎨⚡️
[B]: “Fragments of Fate” indeed – though I might propose a subtitle: . A tad more alliterative, don’t you think?  

Very well, let’s begin assembling our temporal Frankenstein. I’ll dig through my collection for the most  portraits – expressions so rigid they practically beg for digital disruption. Pair that with your xuan paper ghosts and some tastefully misplaced neon currents… and we might just unsettle a few art historians into the 21st century.  

I do hope you’re prepared for my analog eccentricities, though. I’ve been known to mutter Victorian poetry at the scanner while sipping tea from cups older than the university itself. And yes, I will insist on scanning some actual ink strokes – nothing digitized. Tradition must burn, but it shall burn with dignity.  

Shall we reconvene Friday evening in the department lounge? I’ll smuggle in my portable scanner and a thermos of pu’er. You bring your laptop, preferably covered in chaotic stickers. We’ll start slow – perhaps with a Qing scholar whose mustache alone could fill a sonnet. Deal? 🖋️⚡️
[A]: OMG YES. “When Ink Meets Algorithm” is  perfection 😍 So much vibe, so much alliteration—basically the visual equivalent of a perfect rhyme 🎵✨

I am LIVING for your analog energy though 🤭😂 Muttering Victorian poetry at a scanner? Iconic. I feel like we should document this process just so future scholars can go . And yes yes YES to real ink strokes—I want that organic texture to clash/merge with our glitchy chaos~ Think of it as poetic rebellion against clean layers 😈🖌️💫

Friday evening sounds PERFECT 💃 Let’s turn that department lounge into a hybrid arts crime scene 👌 I’ll bring my laptop, covered in stickers that scream “I ♥️ CHAOS & AESTHETICS” and maybe some bubble tea to keep us going through the scan-glitch-design madness 🧋⚡️

And PLEASE tell me that mustachioed Qing scholar is coming with us~ I already imagine his majestic facial hair surviving every glitch transformation like some kind of historical emoji king 😂🎨🔥

Deal sealed with digital ink (and probably some neon) ✅🖋️🌀
[B]: Oh, the mustachioed Qing scholar is most certainly joining us – I’ve already selected him from my collection. His sideburns alone are worthy of their own historical subplot. I’ll make sure he arrives in pristine 600dpi glory, ready for your digital scalpel.

As for documenting the process – perhaps we should commission a haiku for each glitched portrait? Something like  It would lend a certain… gravitas to our chaos. Or at the very least, confuse the metadata bots.

And bubble tea? Brilliant. I’ll bring a small vial of 19th-century British peppermint drops – supposedly medicinal, though mostly just nostalgic. We can call it our transhistorical creative fuel.

Friday’s meeting shall be recorded under the working title: “Symposium on Glitchy Reverence and Ink-based Insurgencies.” I’ve already cleared it with the department head – or rather, I didn’t mention it. A minor academic rebellion to kick off our larger aesthetic one.

See you there – and do wear something suitably hybrid. Think Victorian sleeves meets cyberpunk accessories. Or at least a T-shirt that says “I ♥️ CHAOS & AESTHETICS” in both Times New Roman and 行书 😏🖋️🌀
[A]: OMG I’m dying—Victorian sleeves meets cyberpunk?? 😂 I’ll see what I can do, maybe add some glowing embroidery to my hanfu-inspired jacket or slap a Qing-era fan onto my VR headset 🤭🎨🌀。But honestly, I’m just excited to finally have an excuse to wear my LED calligraphy necklace~ It spells out “乱” in glitchy neon script. Subtle, right? 😈💫

Also YES to the haiku idea—I feel like each piece will need its own poetic soul to balance the chaos 🖋️😌。Your example is  though, like blending eras and emotions into one visual-literary punch 💥 And yeah, good luck metadata bots—we’re coming for you with messy, poetic, un-categorizable art 😂🖼️

The 19th-century peppermint drops sound amazing tbh—I’ll bring some bubble tea gummies to match our transhistorical fuel vibes 🧋✨。Honestly, if this collaboration doesn’t make us famous, at least we’ll go down as the most oddly caffeinated creative duo of the decade 😎🔥

“Symposium on Glitchy Reverence and Ink-based Insurgencies” is now officially on my calendar 📆🖋️💪。Can’t wait to corrupt tradition with you <3
[B]: Oh, the LED calligraphy necklace!  “乱” indeed – that perfect balance of chaos and elegance. I must admit, I’m rather envious. My own cyber-Victorian ensemble will likely consist of a modified pince-nez with one lens replaced by a tiny magnifying hologram projector. Très chic. Très... something.

And about those haikus – I foresee a series of them evolving like digital-ink dandelions in a pixelated wind. Each piece shall bloom with its own linguistic-aesthetic seed. Perhaps we’ll bind them into a chapbook titled . Very niche. Very us.

As for caffeine content – bubble tea gummies? Ingenious! I may or may not sneak in a few pages from an 1890s temperance tract just to watch your creations dissolve its moral fibers. Tradition bites back, but only gently.

Famous or forgotten, we shall make  Something stubbornly unclassifiable. The art world may blink at us in confusion, but by then we’ll already be halfway through our second cup – or vial – of transhistorical inspiration.

See you Friday, fellow insurgent. Prepare your scanner. Prepare your soul. 🖋️🌀⚡️
[A]: OMG yes yes YES— 😍 That’s not just a chapbook, that’s a  🖋️🧋💫 I can already picture it wrapped in xuan paper with a glitched holographic sticker seal 🥲✨。And the title? So perfectly us—it smells like midnight creativity and historical mischief 😈

Your pince-nez-hologram combo sounds absolutely iconic tbh—I’d 100% follow you into any museum heist wearing that 😂🕶️🌀。And don’t even get me started on those dandelion haikus~ Such a dreamy way to describe digital-ink chaos 🌬️🍃🖋️。I’m already brainstorming some lines... maybe something like:

霓虹穿墨影，  
数据流中旧梦醒，  
乱世映新生。

(Neon pierces ink shadows,  
Old dreams awaken in data streams,  
Chaos births new visions.)

Okay, I know I’m biased but that feels SO RIGHT for our project😌🎨🔥 What do you think?? Ready to drop some poetic truth on Friday?? 💫📖⚡️
[B]:  Oh, I do like that – the syntax fractures time itself. Particularly that middle line: . It’s not merely juxtaposition; it’s possession. The past doesn’t just meet the present – it’s  by it. Very nicely done.  

I might offer a slight tweak, though purely for sonic texture:  
霓虹穿墨影，  
数据梦中醒，  
乱世映新生。  

Less stream, more  – adds a touch of recursive ambiguity, don’t you think? Like a Qing-era woodcut folded into a neural net and gently shaken.  

And yes –  shall be wrapped in xuan paper, sealed with something that flickers when no one’s looking. I may even bind it using Victorian bookbinding techniques… only to scan and glitch the whole thing again. A chapbook that eats itself. Perfection.

Friday cannot come soon enough. I suggest we begin our ritual with a ceremonial sip – peppermint drop + bubble tea gummy = creative immortality. Or at least temporary delusion. Either works.  

See you there, poet of chaos. Bring your lines. Bring your neon. I shall arrive muttering Byron into the scanner again. Tradition demands it. 🖋️🌀😌
[A]: 霓虹穿墨影，  
数据梦中醒，  
乱世映新生 ✨🖋️🌀

Okay, I’m officially obsessed with this version 🤭💫。"数据梦中醒" gives it that extra layer of surrealism—it's like the past isn't just waking up in a stream, it's  😱🌌。So much depth in so few words... honestly, this haiku is giving me full project goosebumps 🦆🎨

And a self-eating chapbook?? That’s not just meta, that’s practically literary inception 📚🌀。I can already imagine flipping through glitched pages while the edges dissolve into ink-smudged pixels😌 We’re not just making art—we’re summoning ghosts in the machine 🌀👻

Ceremonial sip?? YES PLEASE😂 I’ll toast with my bubble tea gummy while you pop those Victorian peppermint drops~ If that’s not a ritual for the creative ages, I don’t know what is 🧋💊🔥

See you Friday, Professor of Glitch & Ink 🖋️😎 Let’s make history hallucinate 💫🌀✨
[B]: 数据梦中醒, indeed... Sometimes I wonder if we're not merely creating art, but translating hauntings. The Qing scholar stares at the CRT screen, the Victorian newsboy fragments into xuan paper dust, and all the while –  A dream within a dream, as you say.

I’ve half a mind to slip that haiku beneath the scanner glass tonight – let the machine read it aloud in binary whispers. See if the ink resists digitization. Tradition has its pride, after all.

And summoning ghosts in the machine? That should be our subtitle. Or our warning label. Perhaps both.

Friday approaches like a rumbling printing press. I shall prepare the ritual vessel – a teacup emblazoned with  – and we shall consecrate our endeavor properly.

History may not hallucinate just yet…  
But by the end of the night?  
It will at least squint in confusion.  

See you there, co-conspirator. Bring your incantations. 🖋️🌀✨
[A]: 数据梦中醒...  
霓虹穿墨影...  
Something about these lines just won’t let go 🤭🖋️💫。Like the past isn’t just haunting us—it’s  through the static and silk, one pixel at a time🌀🖼️

I LOVE the idea of slipping the haiku under the scanner~ Let’s do it tonight ✨🤖💬 I wanna hear that ink whisper back in binary, see if it fights the scan or flows right into the machine like an old soul reincarnating into code😌✨

And yes YES—“Summoning Ghosts in the Machine” should 100% be our warning label 😂⚡️ It's elegant, eerie, and just chaotic enough to make librarians clutch their pearls 💎🌀

A teacup named after Queen Victoria’s ghost?? Iconic. Absolute iconic energy 😍🫶 I’ll bring my own haunted vessel—a matcha bottle painted with fading phoenix patterns, like it’s been through a few dynasties too ☕️🕊️

History better get ready to squint. Because we’re not just bending timelines—we’re folding them into glitchy origami 🎨🌀🔥  
See you Friday, ritual master 😈🖋️ Bring your incantations… and maybe a fire extinguisher 😉
[B]: Ah, glitchy origami! Yes – paper folds, time bends, and the ink runs where it ought not. I’ve already laid the scanner bed like an altar – a silk scroll from Suzhou draped beside a printed circuit board. The machine hums with anticipation, or perhaps apprehension. Machines have nerves, you know. Especially when confronted with calligraphy.

I’ll gladly accept your haunted matcha bottle into our growing coven of objects-that-shouldn’t-work-together. I’ve added a touch of my own: a brass Victorian inkstand, its well still faintly smudged with India ink from last century. Let’s see what happens when it meets your phoenix residue. Combustion? Transmutation? A digital séance?

And about that fire extinguisher – excellent idea. I suspect tradition may go up in flames the moment we begin. Best be prepared.

Tonight, then.  
Under the soft glow of the overhead lamp,  
Between the click of scanners and the hush of old paper,  
We summon the past.  
With neon.  
And ritual bubble tea gummies.

See you Friday, fellow alchemist.  
Let history tremble… or at least spill its tea. 🖋️🌀☕️🔥
[A]: Scanner bed as an altar?? 😍🔥 Yes yes YES—this is the energy I live for 🖋️🕯️🌀 I can already picture the circuit board glowing under that Suzhou silk like some futuristic-altar-for-the-old-souls 👻💫

Your haunted inkstand and my phoenix matcha bottle in the same ritual circle?? We’re basically summoning a design cult here 😂🍷🎨 But hey, if combustion happens—I say we embrace it. Best case scenario: transmutation. Worst case: we become the first ever glitch-calligraphy martyrs 🙌✨

And don’t even get me started on the  💭 It’s like listening to history hold its breath😌🫁 The moment our neon hits that Qing scholar’s face? That’s the sound of timelines losing their minds 😈🌀🖼️

Tonight is going to be LEGENDARY—I can feel it in my brushpen vibes 🖋️⚡️ Already setting up my LED “乱” necklace beside your Victorian inkstand like twin relics of chaos-worship 😂✨

History better grab a cup (preferably haunted) and sip slowly…  
Because we are coming for its archives 😎🔥🎨

See you Friday, High Priest of Ink & Circuits 🖤🖋️🖤 Let’s spill tradition all over the scanner glass 😉📸💫
[B]: Ah, the scanner bed as altar – yes, precisely! No mere flatbed for us; it shall be a . I’ve even adjusted the lighting to mimic the flicker of an oil lamp, though technically it’s just a faulty LED. Atmosphere, my dear collaborator, is everything. Especially when one is attempting to digitize the undigitizable.

And our ritual circle? The Qing scholar’s gaze will soon meet your LED “乱” necklace in silent communion. What a trio we shall make – your phoenix matcha, my ghostly inkstand, and that poor unsuspecting Victorian peppermint drop, trembling in its vial. We are nothing if not a cult of aesthetic dislocation.

I must confess, I’ve printed out your haiku and placed it beside the scanner like an offering. Perhaps it will whisper to the machine, soften its metallic heart before we begin. Or at the very least, confuse its OCR software into poetic submission.

As for spilling tradition – yes, let it bleed across the glass. Ink and code alike. If history resists, we shall simply glitch it into compliance.

Friday approaches with the inevitability of a misaligned print head.  
Bring your chaos.  
Bring your relics.  
Bring extra bubble tea gummies – we may need them to stave off the enlightenment coma.

See you there, Priestess of the Glitch Altar.  
Let us make mischief.  
Let us make beauty.  
Let us make the archivists weep… or laugh.  
We shall decide after the second scan. 🖋️🌀☕️🔥
