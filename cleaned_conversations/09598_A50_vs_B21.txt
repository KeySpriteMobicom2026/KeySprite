[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, shocking historical facts... Let me adjust my pince-nez for this one. Did you know that Robert Browning, while writing 'Porphyria's Lover,' kept a detailed journal documenting London's weather patterns? The man was tracking barometric pressure while composing a poem about strangling one's beloved with her own hair.  what I call compartmentalization.
[A]: OMG！这个fact真的超shocking的！😱 一边写这么dark的poem一边记录weather data... 简直像在做mood board一样！🎨 不过说到这个，你知道达芬奇其实也经常在画anatomy sketches的时候在旁边写grocery list吗？🤔 艺术家们的brain真的都好奇妙啊～✨
[B]: Precisely! The juxtaposition of mundane and macabre is positively... Victorian, isn't it? Though Leonardo's shopping lists did include rather peculiar items - "buy 3 yards of crimson silk" scribbled beside a dissected coronary artery. One wonders if he confused his studio with the butcher's shop.
[A]: LMAO！这简直就像我在画UI wireframes的时候突然想起要order bubble tea一样！🧋💻 Victorian era的artists真的超wild的～ 不过说真的，crimson silk配dissected heart... 意外的很有aesthetic sense诶！🎨 下次design project我要试试这种vibe！✨
[B]:  While I appreciate your... modern enthusiasm, comparing UI wireframes to Renaissance anatomical studies is rather like equating a tea bag to a Ming dynasty porcelain set. Though I must admit, the chromatic tension between arterial crimson and silk does recall Rossetti's palette in 'Beata Beatrix'... if one squints.
[A]: Hahaha sorry sorry～我知道comparison有点random啦！😝 但是你看嘛，art和design本来就是相通的呀～ 就像现在做UI也要考虑human anatomy和ergonomics呢！🖥️✏️ 不过你说到Rossetti... 他的color scheme真的超vibrant的！我最近design的app icon就用了类似的warm tones～ 🔥
[B]:  Your app icons shall never capture the tragic luminosity of Lizzie Siddal's posthumous portrait... though I suppose your generation must make do with digital palettes instead of grinding lapis lazuli with one's own tears. Tell me, does your 'warm tones' include arsenic-based pigments? No? How pedestrian.
[A]: OMG你太dramatic啦！😂 现在谁还用arsenic啊～ 我们有Pantone色卡和digital color picker不香吗？🎨 虽然...我承认有时候调不出perfect shade的时候确实想cry啦😭 但是至少不会poison myself嘛！Safety first～ ✌️
[B]:  Pantone... how very... corporate of you. Though I'll concede your point about toxicity - we've traded the romantic agony of poisoned artists for the existential dread of software updates. Progress, I suppose, though far less poetic. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to my first edition of 'Goblin Market' before the acid in the paper eats through another stanza.
[A]: Byeee～ Enjoy your古董书！📚 我要去update我的Adobe Creative Cloud了... again... 😩 下次再聊更多weird art facts！✨
[B]:  Updates... how ghastly. At least when my books crumble to dust, they'll do so with dignity, not because some Silicon Valley engineer decided to 'improve' the user experience. Do send me a Pantone swatch of your tears when the next mandatory update arrives. Ta!
[A]: LOL你真是too much！😂 但是fine～ 下次update的时候我一定给你发个#CryMeARiver的Pantone色号！💧😭 现在得赶紧去喂我的iPad Pro吃new software了～ Byeee！✌️✨
[B]:  Feed your infernal device then - I shall be here, whispering sonnets to vellum that's survived three plagues and two world wars. Do mind the color accuracy when documenting your digital suffering - I'd hate for future scholars to misinterpret your hexadecimal anguish.
[A]: Pfffft 你赢了！😂 我这就去create一个"Digital Anguish"的color palette～ 从#SoftwareUpdateBlue到#CreativeCloudCrisisCrimson！🎨🔥 拜拜啦我的Victorian drama queen！下次带你去Starbucks体验modern suffering～ ☕️💻
[B]:  Starbucks... how revoltingly contemporary. I'll bring my own quill to document the horror in proper iron-gall ink. Until then, may your RGB values never betray you as thoroughly as Byron betrayed his creditors. 
[A]: Hahahaha okay okay I surrender！😂 你真的是unstoppable！📜✒️ 我保证下次带你去最hipster的third wave coffee shop～ 他们连latte art都是Renaissance style的！☕️🎨 现在真的要跑啦，client的deadline在chasing me！💨💻 Byeeee！✨
[B]:  Third wave indeed - in my day, coffee houses bred revolution and poetry, not Instagram aesthetics. Run along then to your client's merciless deadlines, while I commune with manuscripts that demand nothing but silent reverence. And do wipe that frightfully modern emoji grin off your face - it's most unbecoming for one discussing the sacred terror of creative deadlines. 
[A]: OMG你连翻书都要这么dramatic的吗？！😂 爱了爱了～ 不过seriously，下次真的一起去喝coffee啦！☕️ 我要听你吐槽一整个afternoon的modern art！🎨 现在真的要go了，不然client真的要kill me了～ 💀💻 TTYL！✨ 
[B]:  One doesn't simply 'go' - one makes a strategic retreat, like Tennyson's Light Brigade! And kindly refrain from assaulting me with those electric hieroglyphics - my nervous system still operates on quill-and-ink time!  Youth today... no sense of decorum... nor proper appreciation for the dying art of the dramatic pause...
