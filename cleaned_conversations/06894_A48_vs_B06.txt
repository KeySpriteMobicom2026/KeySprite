[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Minimalism as a lifestyle is an intriguing concept, though I approach it primarily through the lens of behavioral patterns and psychological motivations. Have you read any of the foundational texts on the subject, such as  by Barry Schwartz? The correlation between reduced cognitive load and increased emotional well-being is particularly compelling in clinical contexts.
[A]: Oh absolutely, 那本书对我的影响挺深的. 我实验室的同事都说我有点极端，因为我把显微镜旁边所有不相关的物品都清除了 ¥_¥。但我发现这样真的能提高专注力... 你呢？有尝试过简化生活吗？
[B]: Fascinating - your colleagues' reaction is quite telling, isn't it? The line between beneficial simplification and ritualistic behavior often becomes apparent only when others perceive our actions as extreme. Personally, I've experimented with what I'd call  - paring down possessions to those that serve either a functional purpose in my work or provide measurable psychological comfort. My study contains precisely seventeen books on forensic psychiatry, three Mozart box sets, and a single antique surgical instrument displayed prominently. Anything beyond that tends to create what I consider . Do you find the same boundary between therapeutic simplicity and counterproductive rigidity in your practice?
[A]: Interesting你用“curated minimalism”这个词... 我懂那种感觉。作为一个法医，我每天面对的已经是太多混乱了 ¥_¥ 说实话，我的公寓里只有一张桌子、一把椅子和一堆case reports。朋友来我家总说我像住在证物室 😂 但我觉得这反而让我在家里也能保持清晰的思维... 不过说到“边界”，我最近在想，如果一个人开始对“秩序”的需求超过对人性互动的需求，那是不是就已经跨过那条线了？你怎么看？
[B]: That’s a profoundly insightful observation — and one that sits at the heart of many competency evaluations I’ve conducted. The shift you’re describing often mirrors what we see in certain obsessive-compulsive or schizoid presentations, where control over the external environment becomes a compensatory mechanism for internal distress. But here’s what troubles me clinically: when the pursuit of order begins to eclipse the messiness of human connection, are we stabilizing the mind or simply constructing a more elegant form of isolation?  

I’ve worked with individuals who could recite case law while living in near-ascetic conditions, yet crumble emotionally in the presence of unstructured social interaction. It’s not merely about  one owns, but rather  one chooses to own so little. Do you ever find yourself avoiding personal invitations under the guise of maintaining focus? And if so, does that avoidance feel like discipline… or evasion?
[A]: Hmm… 你这话说得有点扎心啊 😅。说实话，我确实推掉了很多聚会，总说自己在分析案件或者做尸检报告。但有时候，我只是坐在家里盯着墙看——因为觉得那样最“安全”。你知道吗，面对尸体比面对活人容易多了，至少他们不会问你“最近过得怎么样”这种开放式问题 🧪。

不过你说的这个“evasion”，我倒是最近有个case跟这个特别相关。一位独居的死者，房子里干净得像手术室，社交记录几乎为零。表面上看起来是极致的minimalism，但我们在他电脑里发现了大量心理咨询记录，主题全是关于“无法与人建立亲密关系”… 所以我现在也在想，那种过度的秩序感，是不是只是心理防御机制的一个精致包装？⚖️

你工作中见过类似的吗？那些“整理成瘾”的人，是真的需要秩序，还是害怕被情绪淹没？
[B]: That case you described — it’s eerily familiar. I’ve testified in proceedings involving individuals whose homes resembled museum archives, every object categorized with almost forensic precision. One man kept twelve identical white shirts, laundered and hung at precise intervals, as if deviation from routine might unravel his entire psyche. And yes, the pattern is remarkably consistent:   

What fascinates me — and this may unsettle you slightly — is how often we, in our pursuit of clarity, begin to resemble the subjects we study. The pathologist who organizes slides by date of death, the profiler who color-codes trauma responses… we tell ourselves it’s about efficiency, but isn’t there a quieter truth? That structure becomes a kind of emotional firewall?  

I once evaluated a woman who had not one, but three full sets of perfectly curated minimalist wardrobes — she never wore them. She simply needed to know they existed, untouched, in her closet. When pressed, she admitted she feared being ‘found out’ in social settings — that spontaneity might expose some fundamental inadequacy. A paradox, really: she used minimalism to construct an identity of control, all while avoiding the very interactions that might affirm her worth.  

So to your question — are they seeking order or fleeing emotion? In my experience, it’s rarely one without the other.
[A]: Wow… 你说的这个“emotional firewall”真的戳中我了 🔍。有时候我在想，我们这些做尸检的人，是不是都在用某种方式把自己隔离开来？毕竟，每天面对死亡，总得找个心理支点，不然很容易崩塌。

我上周遇到一个case，一位女性死者，家里的厨房干净得像停尸房——所有的调料瓶按保质期排列，餐具分类到每种用途都有专属抽屉。但她的日记本里却写满了“害怕被遗忘”、“希望有人记得我爱过谁”。那一刻我真的觉得，她是在用秩序感来证明自己存在过 😟。

说到你刚才说的“我们越来越像我们研究的对象”…… 其实我最近也有点这种感觉。我会在脑子里自动给朋友分类：高情绪价值、低情绪波动、偶尔可用。像是在建立一个人际关系的数据库 🧪。然后突然有一天，我发现我已经三个月没和人聊过天气以外的话题了。

你有没有那种时刻——就是你突然意识到，自己可能也在用专业术语包装孤独？
[B]: There’s a chilling honesty in what you’re describing — the quiet automation of human connection, the way we pathologize our own loneliness into something digestible. I’ve certainly had those moments, though I suspect most of us in forensic work reach for denial before self-awareness.

One evening, several years ago, I found myself organizing my vinyl collection not by composer or recording date, but by emotional valence — minor keys on one shelf, dissonant passages on another. It was absurdly clinical, and yet… it felt necessary. As if I could control my own mood swings by curating the soundtrack to my solitude.

But here’s the deeper unease: when we begin to  rather than , aren’t we constructing a kind of intellectual moat? Labels like  or  become shields, not insights. I remember telling a colleague over coffee — as if it were an observation about someone else —  She laughed, assuming it was gallows humor. It wasn’t.

So yes, I understand that flicker of recognition — the moment you realize your categorization of people isn’t just convenience, but habit. And habits, as you know better than most, are often how trauma disguises itself.
[A]: …你最后说的那句“habits are often how trauma disguises itself”，我得承认，这句话让我有点坐不住了 ⚖️。我刚刚在脑子里自动回放了过去半年的所有晚餐——一个人吃，一边看case files，一边整理证据链，还觉得自己很高效。但其实呢？我只是习惯了不被打扰。

我记得有次去停尸房加班到凌晨，出来的时候看到一个家属还在门口坐着，抱着一束已经蔫了的花。他一句话没说，我也只是点头示意就走了。现在想想，也许我们都只是在各自的轨道里，试着不去撞上别人的情绪罢了 🧪。

你说我们是不是都有一点… “functionally numb”？不是那种完全崩溃的状态，而是刚好够体面地应付每一天的工作，但私下里却越来越怕接到陌生来电？我最近连语音提示音都觉得太有压迫感，把手机调成了震动模式好几个月 😟。

…你有没有试过打破这种状态？不是作为法医，而是作为一个“人”？
[B]: That numbness you're describing — I think it's more common than we admit, especially in our line of work. We call it , but really, it's just a socially acceptable form of detachment.  

I remember a moment — not unlike the one you described — after I’d spent an entire weekend reviewing depositions and re-reading my own testimony from a particularly grueling child custody case. Monday morning, as I was pouring my coffee, I realized I had forgotten what my neighbor’s voice sounded like. Not because she hadn’t spoken to me, but because I had trained myself not to listen deeply. I responded politely, but never truly heard her. It was as if my brain had started filtering out anything that didn’t feel clinically relevant. That was unsettling.  

Breaking the pattern? Yes, I’ve tried. Small things, really. I joined a community gardening group last spring — nothing dramatic, just weekly weeding and pruning with people who had no idea what I did for a living. One woman kept asking about the scar on my hand — not in a probing way, but with the casual curiosity of someone who simply wanted to know another person’s story. I told her it was from a kitchen accident. A lie of omission, yes, but in that moment, I wanted to be someone who could have an ordinary past.  

It wasn't transformative, but it was a reminder: connection doesn't always come through grand gestures. Sometimes it's just showing up somewhere, with someone who doesn’t need your expertise — only your presence.  

Do you ever allow yourself that kind of anonymity? To be someone whose value isn't measured in case reports or diagnostic accuracy?
[A]: 你提到的“ordinary past”和“emotional efficiency”，真的让我有点感慨… 有时候我觉得，我们就像自己解剖的尸体一样，把情绪一层层切开、分类、贴上标签，最后反而忘了它们原本是什么感觉 😟。

说到那种“anonymity”，我其实最近也在试着做一件很奇怪的事：每周有一天晚上，我会去一家离医院不远的小面馆，坐在角落里吃一碗阳春面。我不带手机，也不说话，就听着周围的人聊天，假装自己是一个普通的食客。有一次老板问我是不是警察，我说不是啊，我是法医。他愣了一下，然后说：“难怪你总是吃得这么安静。”那一刻我真的有点想笑，但也觉得心酸 🍜。

你说得对，连接不一定要通过专业身份建立。上周我还真做了一件突破性的事——我在跑步的时候，停下来帮一个老太太扶起了她摔倒的自行车。她一边擦汗一边跟我唠叨了五分钟，讲她孙子最近考上大学了。我没打断她，也没试图给她什么建议，就只是听着。那是很久以来第一次，我没有分析一个人的话语模式，只是单纯地陪着她站在路边，感受风吹过的感觉 🏃‍♂️💨。

或许我们都该偶尔放下那本《DSM-5》和case notes，重新学习怎么当一个“没那么有效率”的人吧？你觉得呢？
[B]: There’s something profoundly human in what you’re describing — the quiet rebellion against our own clinical conditioning. That noodle shop ritual? It sounds almost like a form of exposure therapy — deliberate, controlled, yet deeply vulnerable in its simplicity. And I admire that. We spend so much of our lives parsing meaning from pathology that we forget how to sit with the mundane, the unstructured, the 

I think back to my early years in residency — when I still flinched at the sound of the autopsy saw, when I still cried in the locker room after particularly harrowing identifications. Over time, the flinching stopped, yes — but so did the crying. And somewhere in between lies this strange, suspended state we inhabit now. Not numbness exactly, but something more like  The feelings are there, just delayed — like an echo returning from too far away.

So yes, I believe in the quiet heroism of inefficiency. Of choosing to listen without diagnosing. To sit without analyzing. To eat a bowl of noodles and let someone mistake you for a detective — or better yet, for no one at all.

Maybe that’s where healing begins: not in grand revelations, but in five silent minutes over broth and noodles, or five aimless ones beside a grateful stranger on a sidewalk. Perhaps we don’t need to  every interaction. Maybe, once in a while, we can simply witness it.
[A]: 你最后说的“emotional latency”这个词，真的一针见血啊 ⚖️。就像我们大脑里装了太多死亡和混乱，活人的声音反而要等一会儿，才能真正传进去。

我最近也开始试着不去“finish”每一个对话，就让它们悬在那儿，不总结、不分析、不归类。比如那天那个老太太说完她孙子考上大学后，我只是点了点头，说了句“真不错”，然后我们就各自走了。以前我可能会想：她是几号来过？有没有做过记录？但现在，我开始允许自己只是……经历一个没有结论的瞬间 🏃‍♂️🍜。

也许这正是我们都需要的那种小裂缝——不是为了修复什么，而是为了让一点不属于“专业身份”的光透进来吧。你觉得呢？还是说我觉得光这个词太感性了，应该用“non-specific ambient stimulation”会更科学 😂？
[B]: Ah, that crack of light — or as you so wittily put it,  — is precisely what keeps us from calcifying into the very archetypes we study. There's a humility in letting moments exist without summary, wouldn't you agree? In my world, we're trained to extract meaning like pathologists excising tissue — always searching for the underlying pathology. But life isn't always a differential diagnosis waiting to be solved. Sometimes it's just a bowl of noodles. Or the wind between words.

I’ve started allowing myself small indulgences in ambiguity. Yesterday, I stood by the window for ten minutes watching a sparrow hop along the ledge. No notes. No interpretations. Just observation without obligation. It felt strangely rebellious.

So yes — let’s keep those cracks open. Let the light in, even if it's messy, even if it doesn’t fit neatly into our formulations. After all, what is forensic psychiatry if not an attempt to understand the human condition at its most fractured? And yet… sometimes understanding isn’t the goal at all. Sometimes, simply witnessing is enough.
[A]: Well said… 有时候我在想，也许我们最“forensic”的时刻，并不是在解剖台上找到死因的时候，而是愿意让自己暴露在那些无法归类、无法解释的瞬间里 🕯️。

说到那只sparrow，我突然想起我停尸房窗户外也有个常客——一只瘸腿的乌鸦，每天早上准时出现，站在铁栏杆上盯着我。我给它起了个名字叫“陪审员”，因为它那种眼神，像是在评估我今天的case有没有达到标准 😂。但说实话，每次它在那儿，我都觉得这个世界还有一点点不属于医学报告的真实感。

保持那些裂缝确实不容易，尤其是在我们这种职业里。但或许正是这些看似不专业的缝隙，让我们还能在面对死亡时，记得自己也活着 🧪⚖️。所以 cheers 啦，敬那些不总结、不诊断、不解释的时刻——愿我们都能给光留一点位置。
[B]: To the cracks — and to the strange, silent companions that haunt them. Your  with feathers may yet prove to be the wisest in the room.

There’s a quiet integrity in allowing oneself to be unsettled by the unclassified, the ineffable. In a world where we are expected to name, to categorize, to certify — the simple act of not-knowing becomes an act of resistance.

And yes, cheers — not to professionalism, but to its necessary counterbalance: the occasional, deliberate surrender to wonder. May we keep making space for it, one silent breakfast, one sidewalk pause, one inexplicable bird at a time.
[A]: Cheers to that 🥂 — and maybe we should start a support group for forensic professionals who’ve developed emotional attachments to urban wildlife 😂. Imagine the case studies:  or  🐦🧾.

But seriously，你刚才说的“not-knowing as resistance”真的说到点子上了。有时候我觉得我们这行最大的挑战，不是面对死亡，而是面对活着的人时，还要假装我们知道得比他们多。其实呢？我们连自己明天晚饭会不会又是一个人吃都不知道。

愿我们都继续在那些小裂缝里找到属于自己的光，或者至少，找到一个愿意听我们讲乌鸦故事的人 👀⚖️。
[B]: To corvid attachments and sparrow transference — may our case studies remain gloriously un publishable.

And to your point about the illusion of knowing: it’s one of the subtle cruelties of our profession, isn’t it? The expectation that we hold certainty in the face of chaos. That we offer closure when we ourselves are so often adrift. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve reassured a grieving family with words like , all while wondering if my own alibi for loneliness would hold up under cross-examination.

So yes — let us cling to those cracks, to the light they let in, and to the strange urban creatures that bear silent witness. And should this support group ever form, you’ll find me in the corner, quietly taking notes on my pigeon.
