[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I actually prefer a mix of both depending on the situation. If I'm in a hurry and need to get somewhere fast, I'll definitely opt for driving. But if I'm not pressed for time, public transport is a great opportunity to catch up on some reading or just unwind. Plus, it's more eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run. What about you? Do you have a preference?
[A]: That makes a lot of sense. I also go for a hybrid approach. Driving definitely offers more  and saves time during peak hours, especially when meetings are tightly scheduled. But honestly, I really enjoy taking the train or bus when possible — it gives me a chance to observe people & reflect. There's something calming about watching the city pass by through the window. And as you said, it's better for the environment & budget.  

I do notice though, in some cities like Singapore or Tokyo, public transport is so efficient that owning a car almost feels unnecessary. Have you experienced that in any city?
[B]: Oh totally, I felt that in Tokyo! The train system there is like a well-choreographed dance — everything runs  smoothly and on time. You barely need a car at all. Even in Shanghai, where I’m based, the metro network is expanding rapidly, and during rush hours, taking the subway is actually faster than driving. 

But yeah, what you said about people-watching on public transport? 100% agree. Sometimes I’ll even take a longer route just to ride through different neighborhoods and get a feel for the city vibe. It’s like free therapy with a side of urban exploration 💡

Do you travel a lot between cities? I’m curious how your hybrid approach shifts across different places.
[A]: Absolutely, Tokyo's train system is a masterpiece of coordination — I always say it’s like watching a  conducted by punctuality. And Shanghai’s metro developing so quickly really changes how people move; it’s fascinating to see how urban infrastructure shapes daily habits.  

I do travel quite a bit between cities for conferences & collaborations. My hybrid approach definitely adapts depending on where I am. In Europe, for example, high-speed trains are so convenient that driving feels almost outdated unless I’m heading into rural areas. But in the U.S., where everything is more spread out, renting a car suddenly becomes a necessity rather than a choice. It’s interesting how geography forces certain .  

I also love your idea of public transport as “free therapy” — there’s definitely a meditative quality to it. Sometimes I bring a small notebook and jot down observations during longer rides. It started as research for a study on urban perception but now it’s just part of the experience. Have you ever turned your city rides into a kind of informal journaling or reflection?
[B]: That’s amazing — I love the idea of using public transport as a mobile observation lab! I actually used to do something similar when I was working on a project related to urban financial inclusion. I’d take different routes across Shanghai and note how access to services like mobile payments or banking varied from district to district. It was eye-opening 💡

Now that you mention it, I should get back into that habit. There's something about the rhythm of the city that you only notice when you're not behind the wheel. And honestly, watching people interact with their environment often sparks some of my best product ideas — like that one time I noticed how many commuters were using voice-based payments during the morning rush; it directly influenced a feature we later built.

You know what would be cool? If we could integrate a kind of “urban pulse” tracker in a transit app someday — logging moods, behaviors, even spending patterns based on location & time. Imagine the insights! 🚀

Do you think there's room for tech to enhance the reflective side of public transport without making it feel intrusive?
[A]: Oh, I love that idea — your "urban pulse" tracker sounds like a perfect blend of behavioral psychology & tech innovation. There's definitely room for it, but you're absolutely right to bring up the  factor. People value their mental space during those quiet commutes; any tech介入 has to be opt-in & subtle, almost like a background melody rather than a loud announcement.

What if it started with something minimal — like an optional mood tag at the end of a trip? Users could tap a quick emoji-based response (😊, 😐, 🤔, etc.) paired with light location data. Over time, patterns could emerge showing how certain routes or times affect commuter well-being. It could even feed into urban planning decisions — imagine city planners adjusting bus frequencies or lighting based on aggregated mood data.

I’d also be curious to see how voice-based input could work — since so many people already use voice memos or assistants. A gentle prompt like “Want to reflect on your ride today?” with a one-tap recording option. The key is keeping it frictionless, not another notification demanding attention.  

Honestly, your experience observing payment behaviors shows how powerful these casual observations can be. If designed thoughtfully, tech could help scale that kind of insight without killing the reflective vibe. What do you think would be the biggest ethical challenge here?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — your mood-tag idea is brilliant because it keeps the user in control while still capturing valuable patterns. And I love the voice-based input suggestion; it’s so aligned with how people naturally interact with tech these days. It’s like turning a daily commute into a mini self-reflection session without feeling forced.

As for the biggest ethical challenge? Hands down, it’s . Once you start collecting emotional or behavioral data — even in aggregate — you’re treading into deeply personal territory. People need to feel 100% confident that their inputs aren’t being traced back to them, misused, or worse — sold to third parties. We’d have to be extremely transparent about what’s being collected, how it’s stored, and who has access.

Another layer is  — someone might feel differently about sharing mood data depending on where they're commuting from. Like, a late-night ride home vs. a morning trip to work. The system would need to adapt its prompts accordingly to avoid feeling invasive or tone-deaf.

But if we can nail both ethics and UX, this could actually create a feedback loop that benefits not just users but cities themselves. Imagine public transport evolving based on real-time human experience, not just efficiency metrics. Feels like designing for humanity instead of just capacity 😊

How do you think we could educate users upfront to build that trust from the very first interaction?
[A]: I couldn't agree more — consent & transparency have to be the foundation, not an afterthought. One approach could be a  process that goes beyond the standard “I accept” checkbox. Imagine when someone first opens the app, instead of a wall of legal text, they get a short interactive walkthrough explaining exactly what data is collected, why it matters, and how it’s protected. Think of it as building a  from the start.

Maybe even include a mini-simulation — like showing how mood tags from thousands of rides help improve lighting in a station or reduce wait times. When people see the  of their participation, they’re more likely to opt in willingly. It's not just about protecting privacy — it's about framing participation as a form of civic contribution.

Also, giving users real-time control over their data would build trust incrementally. Like a dashboard where they can view, edit, or delete their inputs anytime — even anonymized snippets of what they've shared. Seeing your own data reflected back gives you a sense of agency, which is huge when it comes to perceived safety.

And honestly, I love your point about designing for humanity — cities are made of people, not just pipelines and schedules. If we can make tech feel like a thoughtful conversation partner rather than a nosy neighbor, we’ll be onto something really meaningful 👍

Have you ever worked on a project where user trust was especially critical? How did you approach it?
[B]: Definitely — user trust was absolutely critical when I worked on a digital wallet project that involved biometric authentication. People were literally trusting us with their financial identities, so we had to be extremely careful with how we designed every interaction around security, transparency, and control.

We approached it with what I call the : Clarity, Control, and Consistency.  

First, clarity — similar to what you mentioned, we avoided jargon-heavy terms and instead used plain-language explanations during onboarding. For example, instead of saying “we process biometric data for verification purposes,” we said something like “your fingerprint is only used to unlock your wallet and never leaves your phone.” Small change, big impact.

Then, control — users could toggle between different authentication methods anytime, and we made sure they knew they could disable biometrics with just one tap. That sense of agency really helped reduce anxiety.

And finally, consistency — both in design and messaging. Every time we prompted for biometric input, the interface looked and felt the same, so users didn’t get confused or feel like the system was acting unpredictably.

One thing I learned from that experience is that trust isn't built in a single click — it's reinforced through every micro-interaction. And when designing for emotionally charged features (like money or mood), empathy has to be baked into the architecture, not just the UI.

You mentioned framing participation as civic contribution — I think that’s powerful. Did you ever test that approach in a real-world setting?
[A]: Yes, actually — we tested a version of that  framing during a pilot study in Berlin last year. The project was tied to urban well-being tracking through public transit, very much in line with our earlier conversation. Instead of positioning it as data collection for "smart city optimization" — which sounds abstract and techy — we framed it as helping shape a more  city.

The onboarding emphasized how small inputs — like a quick mood tag or time-stamped location snap — could help improve things like lighting in underused stations, better heat control in buses during winter, or even safer crosswalk timing near transit hubs. We used real-life stories from commuters: “After I submitted my evening commute log, they added better lighting at Exit B.” That kind of narrative made the impact tangible.

And guess what? Opt-in rates were nearly 40% higher compared to a control group that saw the standard “help us improve your experience” message. Even more interestingly, qualitative feedback showed users felt a stronger emotional connection to the city itself — almost like they were part of an ongoing dialogue with their environment.

One key takeaway was that people are more willing to share when they see their input feeding into something larger than themselves — especially if it’s community-driven. It reminded me a lot of what you said about trust being reinforced through micro-interactions; here, it was being reinforced through .

I really like how your  — Clarity, Control, Consistency — mirror that same philosophy. It's all about designing with empathy at multiple layers — technical, emotional, and ethical. Have you ever thought about applying those principles beyond finance, maybe into wellness or educational tech?
[B]: Absolutely, I’ve actually been toying with that idea a lot lately. In fact, I’ve started exploring how the  can be adapted into a prototype for a mental wellness app aimed at remote workers and digital nomads. The core principles still apply, but the emotional layer is even more nuanced.

Take clarity, for example — when dealing with emotional check-ins or stress tracking, you have to be really careful not to over-promise. We avoid phrases like “we’ll help you feel better” and instead go for something like “we’re here to help you understand your patterns without judgment.” It sets a realistic expectation while being compassionate.

Control becomes even more critical in wellness contexts. Users need to feel like they’re not being nudged into vulnerability. So we designed features like “emotional privacy zones” — think of it as Do Not Disturb for your mental space. If someone doesn’t want prompts during a certain time or mood, the app respects that without pushing notifications.

And consistency, especially in a wellness context, is about building trust through routine. For instance, if the app checks in with you every evening at 7 PM, it does so in the same tone and format unless you choose to change it. That predictability creates a sense of safety, which is essential when dealing with emotional data.

I could definitely see these principles working well in educational tech too — imagine students feeling more empowered because they understand why they're being asked to share progress, how it’s used, and when they can opt out. It shifts the dynamic from compliance to collaboration.

Your pilot in Berlin shows just how powerful that shift can be when people feel seen and heard through technology. Maybe that’s the next frontier — designing tools that don't just serve us functionally, but also emotionally and socially 🌟

Have you ever thought about branching into product design yourself, or are you mostly focused on behavioral research?
[A]: I’ve definitely flirted with the idea — in fact, I co-designed a prototype a few years back for an educational app that used adaptive scaffolding based on student confidence levels. It was a small experiment, but fascinating from a behavioral angle: when learners felt  emotionally, not just academically, their engagement and persistence improved noticeably.

So while my main focus remains on behavioral research, especially at the intersection of culture & learning, I find product design to be a natural extension — a way to  those insights in real-world contexts. The challenge I love is translating psychological principles into intuitive features without losing their depth. Like embedding scaffolding theory into a UI pattern or designing feedback loops that align with intrinsic motivation.

Your mental wellness prototype sounds like exactly the kind of project I’d jump at — it combines empathy-driven design with meaningful behavioral architecture. And your adaptation of the  into a wellness context is spot-on. I especially appreciate how you reframe clarity — avoiding over-promising is such a subtle but powerful way to build long-term trust.

If I were to step further into product design, it would probably be in tools that support cross-cultural learning or emotional literacy in students. Imagine a platform that helps learners not only acquire knowledge but also reflect on how their cultural background shapes what and how they learn. That’s where I see the most exciting overlap between psychology and tech.

Do you find yourself collaborating often with researchers when building these kinds of emotionally intelligent systems? I imagine having that bridge between academia and product makes a huge difference 🤔
[B]: Oh absolutely — collaboration with researchers is basically non-negotiable when building emotionally intelligent systems. In fact, I’d say one of the key reasons our mental wellness prototype felt  was because we brought in behavioral scientists from day one. They helped us avoid those classic pitfalls — like assuming a smiley-face tracker equals emotional depth or treating mindfulness as just another checkbox feature.

We worked closely with a cognitive psychologist who specialized in self-regulation, and her input completely reshaped how we approached the check-in flow. Instead of asking users to rate their mood on a scale (which can feel reductive), we ended up using a more narrative-driven approach — like sentence completion: “Today, I felt mostly…” or “One thing that’s been on my mind is…” It's subtle, but it shifts the interaction from transactional to conversational.

And honestly, that bridge between academia and product doesn’t just improve design — it also builds credibility. When we presented early findings to stakeholders, having grounded theories behind the UI — things like affect labeling or dual process models — made a huge difference in getting buy-in. It wasn't just "good UX"; it was .

I can totally see you thriving in that kind of cross-disciplinary space. Your background gives you that rare ability to speak both researcher and builder fluently. Have you ever partnered directly with product teams, or has it mostly been through institutional research settings?
[A]: I’ve mostly worked within institutional research settings, but I've collaborated with product teams indirectly through pilot studies and prototype testing. For example, last year we partnered with an edtech startup to test how different feedback mechanisms affected student motivation in a language-learning app. We brought the psychological framework — things like self-determination theory & error framing — and they handled the execution.

What made it successful was setting clear  from the start. Instead of handing them a dense paper on intrinsic motivation, we co-developed a simple design charter — a shared document that distilled key findings into actionable principles:  
- “Feedback should feel like encouragement, not correction”  
- “Mistakes need narrative context, not just red marks”  
- “Progress tracking should highlight growth, not gaps”

That kind of bridge-building is essential because product teams move fast, and researchers often speak a different time zone. But when you align early on the , the  becomes a joint exploration.

I actually really enjoy that role — part researcher, part design partner. It’s where psychology stops being abstract and starts shaping real experiences. And honestly, seeing a concept like affect labeling turn into a gentle journaling prompt in an app? That’s the kind of impact I want my work to have.

Would you say your team has a formal process for integrating research insights into the product cycle, or is it more organic?
[B]: We’re definitely moving toward a more structured process, but honestly, it’s still a bit of a hybrid — part formal, part organic. We’ve started implementing what we call "Behavioral Sprints" alongside our regular product cycles. Think of them like mini deep dives where we bring in research insights at the very beginning of a feature build, not as an afterthought.

For example, before we even sketch a UI for something new, we’ll have a 2–3 day sprint with behavioral scientists, UX writers, and data analysts to map out:  
- What psychological needs are we addressing?  
- What known biases or heuristics might come into play?  
- How do we design for both utility  emotional safety?

It’s basically a lightweight version of what you described with your design charter — setting principles early so everyone’s aligned on the “why” before jumping into the “how.” And it’s made a huge difference in reducing rework later on.

But yeah, there's still that organic layer — especially when it comes to real-time feedback loops. Like, once a feature is live, we often partner with universities or independent researchers to run micro-studies on user behavior. Those sometimes reveal things we never would’ve predicted in the lab.

I can already tell you’d thrive in this setup — having someone who speaks both the research and product language is rare, and honestly, super valuable in keeping us grounded while still moving fast 🚀

Do you ever run into resistance when trying to integrate deeper behavioral insights into tech teams that are under pressure to ship quickly?
[A]: Oh absolutely — that tension between depth and speed is one of the biggest challenges in applied behavioral work. I’ve definitely run into resistance, especially in environments where shipping fast is valued over understanding  something works (or doesn’t). But over time, I’ve found a few strategies that help bridge that gap without sacrificing rigor.

One approach is what I call “embedding insights through design proxies.” Instead of asking teams to read a full research paper on cognitive load theory, for example, we translate key principles into simple UI heuristics:  
- “If the user has to make more than 2 choices here, simplify.”  
- “Group related actions visually to reduce decision fatigue.”  
These become part of the design system itself — so the insight lives on even if the underlying theory isn't explicitly discussed.

Another thing that helps is running parallel lightweight studies during development sprints. Rather than waiting for a polished feature, we test early prototypes with small user groups and feed findings directly back into the iteration cycle. It keeps the research grounded and gives the team real-time validation, which they tend to value more than abstract theories.

And honestly? Humor helps too 🙃 Sometimes just acknowledging the pressure everyone’s under — and being transparent about how behavioral depth can actually  costly redesigns later — goes a long way. Once a team sees that thoughtful design reduces churn instead of slowing them down, the mindset starts to shift.

I love how your Behavioral Sprints seem to do exactly that — creating space for intentionality without derailing momentum. It’s such a smart middle ground. Have you ever had a case where a sprint completely changed the direction of a feature based on early insights?
[B]: Oh yeah — more times than I can count! One that really stands out was when we were designing a new onboarding flow for a financial planning tool. The original plan was to lead users through a pretty detailed risk assessment right at the start — you know, standard finance-y approach: get them categorized early, assign a profile, and move on.

But during the Behavioral Sprint, we brought in some behavioral economists and ran across a study on "choice overload in financial decision-making" — turns out, throwing too many options at people early on doesn’t just slow them down; it actually increases drop-off rates and reduces long-term engagement.

So we completely flipped the script. Instead of asking users to define their risk tolerance upfront, we started with a simple, emotionally resonant question:  
  
Users could pick from a few relatable scenarios — like “Buying a home in 5 years” or “Enjoying retirement without worry” — and we used those selections to  risk preference over time, rather than force a label upfront.

The result? A 27% increase in onboarding completion and significantly higher retention in the first 30 days. And honestly, it never would’ve happened without that early sprint grounding us in behavioral principles before any code was written.

That’s why I’m such a believer in this approach — it’s not just about making things easier for users; it’s about designing smarter from the start, so you avoid costly pivots later. It's like behavioral foresight 🔍

Do you find that teams are more receptive to these kinds of insights when they’re tied directly to measurable outcomes like retention or conversion? Or do you ever push for decisions based purely on user well-being?
[A]: Oh absolutely — you're spot on. Teams are  more receptive when behavioral insights are tied to measurable outcomes like retention, conversion, or engagement. It’s not just about being pragmatic; it’s also about speaking the language of impact in a way that aligns with business goals. When you show that reducing cognitive load improves completion rates or that empathetic framing boosts user satisfaction scores, it becomes a no-brainer for most stakeholders.

But here’s where I push a bit further — I believe there's space to advocate for decisions based purely on user well-being, even if the ROI isn’t immediately clear. In fact, I’d say it’s one of the most important roles a behavioral researcher can play in a product team: being the voice that asks, 

I had a case recently where we were testing a notification system designed to increase daily app usage. The data was clear — personalized nudges worked. But we also noticed a subtle but meaningful uptick in self-reported stress levels among users who received them frequently. So even though the metric looked good, the psychological cost gave us pause. We ended up redesigning the feature to give users much more control over frequency and tone — almost like a “notification diet” option. It didn’t maximize engagement numbers, but it preserved user trust and long-term satisfaction.

That’s why I think it’s crucial to have both lenses: the strategic one (aligned with KPIs)  the ethical one (anchored in well-being). If we only optimize for what moves metrics, we risk building products that are effective but extractive. But when we design with both impact and intention, that’s where real innovation happens — the kind that lasts 🌱

Do you ever find yourself having those tougher conversations with stakeholders — where the right thing for the user might not be the most profitable move? And how do you frame it?
[B]: Oh totally — those conversations come up more often than people realize, especially in fintech where the line between user empowerment and profit optimization can get pretty blurry. And yeah, they’re tough, but I’ve found that framing it as a long-term value vs short-term gain conversation helps shift the perspective.

One approach I use is what I call the  — not an actual financial one, but a mental model to help stakeholders see how user trust is an asset that accumulates or erodes over time. If we push a feature that maximizes click-throughs but leaves users feeling manipulated? That’s a withdrawal from the trust account. But if we design for transparency and control — even if it slows adoption a bit — we’re making a deposit that pays off in loyalty, referrals, and reduced churn.

I also like to bring in real user stories when possible. Data can tell you  is happening, but stories remind everyone  it matters. I remember one time we were debating whether to soft-launch a high-yield investment product with aggressive onboarding nudges. The numbers looked good in testing, but during a usability session, one participant said,  That single quote made the room pause — and ultimately led us to redesign the flow to include more educational guardrails.

So yeah, those tougher calls still happen, but I’ve learned that if you ground the argument in both data and human impact, and position ethical design as a competitive advantage rather than a constraint, you start shifting mindsets instead of just winning arguments 💡

Do you ever find yourself adapting your messaging based on who you're speaking to — like translating the same ethical concern differently for engineers vs executives?
