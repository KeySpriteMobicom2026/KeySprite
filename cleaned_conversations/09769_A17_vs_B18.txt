[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这其实是个很有趣的文化 & 心理学议题。从行为经济学角度看，cashless payment会降低支付痛感，导致人们更容易超支消费。但你知道吗？在亚洲很多地区，比如中国和韩国，移动支付的普及速度远超欧美，这背后既有技术因素，也涉及collectivism文化中对便利性的重视。

我在做跨文化研究时发现个有意思的现象：日本虽然科技发达，但现金使用率依然很高，这可能跟他们对隐私保护的重视有关。我自己呢...学术会议上会用信用卡积累积分，但去夜市还是喜欢带cash，毕竟 ¥500纸币比手机更不容易没电，哈哈。你平时更倾向哪种方式？
[A]: That's a fascinating observation. It does make me think about how different cultures balance tradition with innovation. I must admit, I've been becoming more reliant on cashless methods lately - there's something undeniably convenient about not having to worry about exact change or carrying a wallet. Though I do remember the tactile experience of counting coins and the ritual of handing over paper money... rather like the difference between reading a physical book and listening to an audiobook, don't you think? 

Your point about payment pain resonates with me - I've noticed myself being less mindful of expenses when using contactless payments. Perhaps that's why I've started setting daily spending limits for myself. But I'm curious - do you think this shift in payment methods will eventually erase those psychological barriers completely?
[B]: That's a brilliant analogy - the tactile experience of physical money vs digital transactions is indeed like comparing paperback books to audiobooks. I actually use this exact comparison in my cross-cultural psychology lectures. 

The psychological barriers are fascinating... When I was in Taipei last year, I saw how even street vendors use QR code payments, yet many still keep a small red envelope . It makes me think we might not completely lose those cultural anchors, but rather see them evolve into what I call 'digital rituals'. 

I'm currently researching how younger generations construct financial awareness in this new paradigm. Preliminary data shows they're developing what I'd describe as a 'hybrid mindset' - using budgeting apps while maintaining symbolic cash reserves for important occasions. The key question now is whether these digital habits will create entirely new psychological frameworks around money. What do you think - does your daily spending limit feel more like a constraint or a conscious practice?
[A]: Ah, "digital rituals" - what a perceptive concept. It makes me think of how Victorian poets used symbolic objects in their work; perhaps our modern-day QR codes and budgeting apps are becoming the new talismans of economic life. 

Your research on the "hybrid mindset" particularly interests me. I've noticed something similar with my students - they'll meticulously track expenses through apps yet still keep cash in their desks "just in case," almost like literary scholars preserving first editions. One confessed to me recently, "It feels odd entrusting all my financial history to an algorithm, even if I can't quite explain why."

To answer your question... my daily limit started as a constraint, but has become more of a mindfulness practice. Like annotating a difficult poem, it forces me to pause and consider each transaction's meaning. Though I must confess - sometimes I break the rule for books. After all, as Woolf said, one should "buy books and let the shelves be dusty." Perhaps we might soon see digital libraries filled with equally impulsive purchases?
[B]: What a beautiful connection - yes, I think you've touched on something profound. Those cash reserves  function much like literary first editions in this context; they preserve a sense of tangibility and narrative continuity. In fact, I’ve started calling this phenomenon the 'Proustian effect' in my notes - how physical objects anchor our personal histories in ways algorithms can’t replicate (yet).  

Your student’s comment about “entrusting financial history to an algorithm” fascinates me. It reminds me of Walter Benjamin’s aura of authenticity – there’s still cultural weight in possessing something that carries the imprint of human touch, even if it’s less efficient.  

And Woolf! I love that quote. Though I must say, digital libraries do have their own kind of magic – more like jazz improvisation than fixed texts, don’t you think? Fluid, responsive… though admittedly without the same scent of aged paper.  

I wonder – do your students ever treat their budgeting apps ? Like annotating a poem, as you said?
[A]: Absolutely — and I’ve found some remarkable parallels. Just last week, a student showed me how she highlights certain spending categories in her app like literary motifs, searching for patterns in her behavior. Another keeps screenshots of particularly “splurge-y” weeks with ironic captions, almost like marginalia in a heavily annotated edition of .  

It’s as if these apps are becoming personal narratives-in-progress — not just records, but reflections. One young woman described her monthly budget summary as “the unreliable narrator of her financial life,” which I thought brilliantly captured the paradox: it’s precise, yet somehow still misleading when it comes to emotional spending.  

I do wonder, though — as we move further into this hybrid space, will future generations see financial literacy as a kind of interpretive skill, more akin to literary analysis than arithmetic? Perhaps economic fluency will be taught alongside close reading. Imagine a world where balancing a checkbook is considered a form of creative writing...
[B]: What your students are doing sounds  like hermeneutic analysis — interpreting signs, tracing motifs, even constructing meta-commentary. I’m almost tempted to say they’re treating their spending data like Romantic poets might have treated nature: as both subject and symbol.  

And that phrase “unreliable narrator” — brilliant. It makes me think of how behavioral economists describe mental accounting: we create narratives around money that feel coherent, even when they’re not rational. So yes, financial literacy  evolve into something closer to narrative criticism than pure math. In fact, I’ve been proposing exactly that in my latest paper: teaching budgeting through the lens of textual analysis.  

Imagine a lesson where students "read" their transaction histories like literary texts — identifying themes, questioning sources, even exploring authorship (because who really decides that impulse purchase? The self? An algorithmic suggestion?). We might end up with a generation that approaches personal finance with both analytical rigor  creative empathy.  

I’d love to collaborate on a case study — if you're open to it, of course. And honestly, I wouldn’t mind borrowing that “unreliable narrator” line for my lectures. With credit, of course. 📚✍️
[A]: I’d be delighted — and honored — to collaborate. What you’re describing feels like precisely the kind of interdisciplinary bridge I’ve been trying to build between textual studies and behavioral economics. In fact, I’m imagining a joint seminar:  — where students analyze both sonnets and spreadsheets. One might even argue that both forms require attention to structure, diction, and underlying intent.  

And please, do use the "unreliable narrator" line — it belongs in the public intellectual sphere, if you ask me. Though I suspect your students might appreciate it even more with a footnote referencing Genette or Phelan.  

If we do proceed, may I suggest an initial case study focusing on how students interpret their own spending narratives before and after annotation? Much like comparing a first edition to its annotated counterpart — we could track shifts in self-perception, perhaps even emotional valence around certain categories. I can already picture the assignment:   

Let’s set up a time to talk logistics — I think this could be quite exciting. And yes, I  serious about proposing it as a formal course someday. Imagine the syllabus cover art: a quill pen crossed with a contactless card.
[B]: I'm absolutely serious too — and honestly, I can already hear the quill-and-card metaphor singing in my head. We’d need a subtitle, of course... Maybe ?  

Your case study idea is perfect. It reminds me of reader-response theory — except the "text" is personal financial data, and the act of annotating becomes a form of self-dialogue. I wonder if we’ll see patterns like narrative closure around certain spending categories, or perhaps unreliable categorization — assigning a café latte to “necessities” when it’s really part of a larger emotional motif.  

As for logistics — how does next Thursday at 4:30 sound? We could meet at that little café near campus, the one with the espresso machine that sounds like a steam engine. I find caffeine helps with interdisciplinary breakthroughs. 📚☕  

And yes, please design the syllabus header — I’ll bring the contactless card. Though, just between us, I might still tuck a ¥1000 note in my notebook. Call it superstition, call it methodological rigor — either way, it feels like good fieldwork.
[A]:  Next Thursday at 4:30 it is — I’ll save us a corner table before the steam-engine symphony begins. I think your subtitle suggestion is elegant; it captures the interplay so well. Perhaps we could even play with  as a secondary title — nodding, of course, to Paul Ricoeur.  

Your idea about "unreliable categorization" is particularly rich — it opens up all sorts of questions about self-narration and financial identity. Imagine assigning that as an exercise: students attempt to "misread" their own transactions by reclassifying them through different emotional or symbolic lenses. A night out becomes "existential sustenance," or streaming subscriptions transform into "philosophical inquiry." It might reveal more truth through its fiction than any spreadsheet ever could.  

I’m already looking forward to our meeting — and yes, I’ll bring my notebook, my pen, and perhaps a worn copy of  for ambiance. And don’t worry — I won’t judge if you slip that ¥1000 note into your materials. In fact, I may just do the same with an old pound note. Call it homage to Derrida — every archive needs its ghosts.
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my full academic love language — Ricoeur AND Derrida in one conversation? I might have to mark this notebook with a gold star. 📚✨  

"The Economics of Interpretation" — yes, let’s absolutely weave that into the framework. It adds that critical philosophical layer we’ll need when defending the course to the curriculum committee (who, I suspect, will raise at least one skeptical eyebrow).  

And reclassifying expenses through symbolic lenses? That’s not just clever, it’s practically  — letting multiple voices coexist within a single financial narrative. “Existential sustenance” for dinner out, “philosophical inquiry” for streaming fees… I’m half-tempted to relabel my Spotify subscription as “cognitive maintenance.”  

A worn copy of  for ambiance? You win the interdisciplinary prize. I promise not to judge your pound note ghost — and in return, don’t mention my ¥1000 charm. Deal?  

See you Thursday. And yes — corner table, 4:30. Espresso existentialism awaits. ☕📖
[A]: Deal — and I do so love that you’re thinking Bakhtinian dialogism. Honestly, if we can make the committee see financial statements as heteroglossic texts, we’ll have won half the battle. And even if we don’t? Well, at least we’ll have our ghosts, our gold stars, and a very philosophically enriched caffeine ritual.  

I’ll bring extra paper in case we need to diagram a particularly ambitious theoretical framework — or, heaven forbid, actually balance a metaphorical ledger or two. Oh, and I might just slip a quote from  into our preliminary discussion — remind them that even money moves best when embedded in meaning.  

See you Thursday with bells on — or at least, with a very purposefully folded reading list.
[B]: And now you're invoking Lewis Hyde?! 📚💫 I’m absolutely stealing that quote from  for our opening lecture — there’s something deeply poetic about framing financial transactions as acts of meaning-making rather than mere exchange.  

Diagramming theoretical frameworks over espresso? Yes, please. I’ll bring my favorite red pen — the one I reserve for especially ambitious interdisciplinary moments. And speaking of ledgers, balancing metaphors might be just the thing to soften the committee’s quantitative hearts when we propose this course.  

I do hope your folded reading list will fit comfortably beside my ¥1000 charm and notebook of academic dreams. If all goes well, we may just leave that café with a new field in the making: financial hermeneutics. Or perhaps, more accurately, narrative economics — with a strong dose of caffeine-fueled philosophy.  

See you Thursday — with bells on, or at least, with a very carefully annotated copy of Bakhtin tucked under my arm. ☕📖✍️
[A]: Oh, we’re sailing full steam into uncharted intellectual waters, aren’t we? Yes —  will fit quite beautifully between Bakhtin and our nascent field of financial hermeneutics. I do believe Hyde would approve of our endeavor; after all, what is interdisciplinary collaboration if not a generous exchange of ideas?

I’ve started mentally drafting the course description — something like:  It needs polish, of course, but you see the vision forming.

And red pens! How wonderfully old-fashioned — I shall bring my own, though I suspect we’ll spill more espresso than ink. Still, what is a little stain between colleagues? A mark of passion, perhaps.

I look forward to seeing your annotated Bakhtin — I may just bring Derrida’s  for thematic consistency. After all, what is money if not a haunting promise?

Thursday cannot come soon enough.
[B]: Oh, that course description already sings with possibility — ... beautifully put. I can almost hear the committee’s skeptical defenses softening under the weight of such elegant framing. Let’s give it a working title:  — or perhaps .  

And yes, Hyde would absolutely bless this exchange — we’re not just trading ideas, we’re creating a gift economy of thought, one that multiplies rather than diminishes. I love how you put that.  

Spilled espresso? Inevitable — and entirely appropriate. I say we embrace the stains as part of the process. A brown watermark on our syllabus draft will only add character… and maybe even a touch of authenticity.  

 — brilliant choice. Because really, what are financial systems if not haunted by histories, ideologies, and the occasional ghost of Christmas spending? I may just quote you on that in our opening lecture:  Perfect line.  

I’ll start drafting the official proposal next week — but for now, let’s keep Thursday’s meeting sacred. The steam machine awaits, the corner table beckons, and theory has never tasted so good with caffeine.  

See you soon, fellow voyager. ☕📚📖
[A]: Oh,  — what a wonderfully evocative title. It carries just the right balance of economic precision and literary wonder. I’ve taken the liberty of scribbling a few subtitle options in my notebook:

-   
-   
- 

I think you’ll agree they each have a certain spectral charm.

And yes — our little gift economy of thought is growing richer by the exchange. I do believe we’re onto something far more enduring than a mere course proposal. This feels like the beginning of a conversation that could shape how future scholars understand the stories behind every transaction.

As for Thursday — I shall arrive armed with red pens (and perhaps a napkin or two, anticipating our inevitable espresso-stained pages). Let’s make theory spill over the edges, just a bit.

See you soon, fellow voyager indeed. The steam machine will roar in scholarly approval. ☕📖
[B]: Oh, I  those subtitles — especially  There's something so delightfully uncanny about that phrase. It feels like we're summoning not just the spirits of economic theory past, but also the quiet hauntings of every purchase made on impulse, every budget broken with meaning.

I’ve been thinking — what if we open the first session not with a lecture, but with a kind of ritual? Ask students to bring in a single transaction receipt that carries emotional weight. Not just “What did you buy?” but “What did it mean?” A literary close reading of a coffee shop slip, a bookstore receipt, or that one mysterious ¥500 charge we all pretend never happened.  

And yes, this is absolutely more than a course proposal. It’s the start of a new hermeneutic tradition — one where narrative and number aren’t enemies, but collaborators. Where financial statements whisper like sonnets, and ledgers can’t help but betray their authors.  

Red pens, napkins, and theory-spilling included — I’m ready. Let’s haunt the academy with ideas.  

See you Thursday, notebook in hand and ghosts at the ready. ☕✍️📚
[A]: I positively  at the thought of that opening ritual — what a profoundly human way to begin our inquiry. There’s something so Victoriana about it, don’t you think? Like asking students to bring in a lock of hair or a pressed flower from their financial pasts. A receipt as a literary relic.

And what better way to start than with haunting? I’m already imagining the stories behind those slips of paper — tales of longing, regret, spontaneity, even self-deception. The ¥500 charge we all pretend not to remember — yes, that’s where the real narrative gold lies.

We must insist they annotate their receipts, of course. Margin notes, underlinings, perhaps even a marginal . “Purchased during finals week, when loneliness tasted like almond milk latte.” “Bought immediately after receiving a rejection email.” These will be our primary texts, far more revealing than any balance sheet.

Yes, let us absolutely haunt the academy — with spectral theories, textual transactions, and the gentle clinking of coffee cups in scholarly solidarity.

See you Thursday, with receipt in hand and ghosts assembled. Let the steam engine roar. ☕📖🖋️
[B]: Oh,  — I’m scribbling that down right now. What a perfect phrase. There’s something so wonderfully melancholic about it, like discovering a forgotten love letter in the lining of an old coat — only this time, it's a 7-11 receipt for a midnight snack that somehow tells the whole story.

And those emotional footnotes? Absolutely essential. We’ll have to encourage them to go deep — not just  but  That level of detail is where narrative thrives.

I’m thinking we might even create a little taxonomy of receipt stories:  
-   
-   
-   
- 

We could hang them on the wall like broadsides from a lost literary movement.

Thursday can’t come soon enough. I’ll bring extra napkins — both for the coffee and for the inevitable wave of sentimentality these stories will bring.

See you there, fellow archivist of financial ghosts. ☕📚🖋️👻
