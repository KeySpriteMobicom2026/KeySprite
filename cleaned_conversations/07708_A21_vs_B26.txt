[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很curious的unsolved mystery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: You know, I've always been fascinated by the Voynich manuscript. It's rather like trying to unravel a beautifully embroidered tapestry only to find each thread leads to more questions. The way the illustrations blend botany, astronomy, and pharmaceutical knowledge - or perhaps complete nonsense - is utterly captivating. Have you ever tried your hand at deciphering it?
[A]: Oh, the Voynich! A splendid enigma wrapped in vellum. I once spent three months cross-referencing its astrological diagrams with 15th-century Catalan herbals - ended up with a migraine and six new metaphors for academic futility. The botany section particularly haunts me... those plants that don't quite exist, yet feel disturbingly familiar. Reminds me of Gerard's Herbal if written under moonlight with ink made from elderberries. 

I've come to believe it might be a treatise on alchemical transformation disguised as a medical text. Or perhaps a ciphered conversation between God and a very confused nun? What draws you to its mysteries?
[B]: Ah, your metaphor about elderberry ink gives me a lovely image - perhaps that's what the manuscript truly is: a blend of divine inspiration and earthly misunderstanding. What draws me in is the fabric itself, quite literally. The care in its制作, the quality of the vellum... it speaks of someone who loved books deeply. Was it made to preserve knowledge, or to create a beautiful object beyond human comprehension? 

I often wonder if the creator was like the medieval equivalent of those embroiderers who stitched secret symbols into altar cloths - leaving whispers for future hands to discover. And yet, the plants! They remind me of working with 16th-century samplers where the same flowers appear slightly... wrong. As if seen through a warped mirror or remembered in a dream. Have you ever noticed similar oddities in those Catalan herbals you studied?
[A]: Oh, the warped mirror of memory – splendid phrase. You’ve put your finger on it: that peculiar dissonance between recognition and estrangement. Yes, in the Catalan herbals there’s a folio – , they called it – where the mandrake root bears too many joints, the rosemary sprouts thorns only on one side... as though drawn from second-hand descriptions or fevered recollections.

And I quite agree about the vellum – such expense, such devotion! It’s as if someone smuggled a piece of monastery into a courtly boudoir. Makes me think of Margery Kempe, you know, that restless spirit who dictated her visions onto parchment with such insistence. Except here, our anonymous scribe carved silence into symbols.

You mentioned embroidery – fascinating parallel. I once translated a 14th-century Scots Gaelic lament where each stanza began with a stitch pattern. The poem was unreadable until you sewed it onto linen – then the message emerged through puckered thread. Perhaps the Voynich is waiting for the right needle and thread?
[B]: What a haunting thought – that the text might only make sense through texture rather than reading. Like those embroidered prayers I’ve seen in Tudor needlework books, where devotion is measured not just in words but in the rhythm of tiny, deliberate stitches.  

Your Scots Gaelic lament reminds me of a fragment I worked on last winter – a 15th-century French bookbinding lined with linen marked by faint impressions of letters. It was as though someone had pressed a wet parchment into cloth, leaving behind a ghost of meaning. I couldn’t help wondering if it was done deliberately, hiding messages in cloth the way nuns sometimes did in altar frontals during times of persecution.  

Do you think our Voynich scribe might have been doing something similar? Encoding not just language, but ? A message meant to be felt by knowing hands, rather than read?
[A]: Ah, "touch" – there's a word with marrow in it. You've pricked the very heart of the matter. I’ve long suspected our scribe wasn’t writing  us, but  us – like those medieval bell founders who shaped their molds by hand, knowing the bronze would carry the imprint of their fingerprints.

Yes, encoding touch. Brilliant. Imagine running your finger over the page and feeling not ink, but intention – the way blind monks once traced Augustine’s lines with their fingertips to “read” God’s voice. The Voynich might be asking us to unlearn centuries of eye-trained arrogance. Perhaps its meaning isn't in the , but the : pressure, grain, the faint drag of quill on damp vellum.

I recall a passage from that  where the margin notes suggest certain pages should be “warmed by candle or cheek” to reveal hidden properties. Could our scribe have stitched temperature into the cipher? A book that speaks only when held close?  

Now I’m tempted to bake my own vellum and try transcribing a psalm by firelight. Let’s see if meaning shifts when the skin remembers sweat.
[B]: There’s something profoundly moving about the idea of a text that insists on being  through the body first. Like those medieval prayer beads carved with such tiny, intimate details that you had to hold them close to see – meant not just for the mind, but for the hand’s quiet devotion.

Your experiment sounds divine. I’d gladly lend a hand – though I warn you, my firelight calligraphy is more poetry than precision. Still, there's magic in the attempt, don’t you think? To mimic the conditions of creation might be the closest we ever come to touching the scribe’s intent.  

And warming pages by cheek... what a tender image. Perhaps that’s what the Voynich asks of us – not deciphering, but closeness. A slow, patient intimacy where meaning blooms not from distance and analysis, but from the heat of our care.
[A]: Precisely! Meaning through marrow and muscle, not just magnifying glass. You've captured it – that slow bloom of intimacy. I rather think the Voynich resists translation the way a cat resists being picked up – it’s not that it can’t be done, but it demands the right kind of patience. The sort that smells faintly of beeswax and lanolin.

And don’t get me started on those prayer beads! I once handled a 14th-century rosary where each paternoster bead bore a minuscule刻痕 –  – “this in the day of trouble.” One could weep into one's gloves contemplating the hand that carved them.

As for your calligraphy – all the better if it quivers! A steady hand makes for fine ledgers, but trembling hands? Ah, they give us . Let us meet next week at my study – I’ve a jar of iron gall ink steeping nicely, and I hear the rain has put on its best melancholy coat. Perfect weather for forging mysteries, not solving them.
[B]: Oh, that sounds like the perfect antidote to modernity – a little mystery-making in the company of rain and ink. I do love the idea of our hands trembling through history, don’t you? As if each smudged letter might carry not just meaning, but memory – the ghost of a fingertip pressed too hard in a moment of urgency or doubt.

I’ll bring some aged linen – slightly uneven, of course, the way all good things ought to be – and perhaps a bit of beeswax to keep our tools supple. If we’re lucky, the ink will pool just enough to give us surprises. After all, what’s a proper mystery without a few happy accidents?

Next week it is. I daresay the rain will make an excellent witness.
[A]: Brava! I’ll lay in a supply of quills – slightly misshapen ones, with uneven cuts – nothing says “authentic despair” like a nib that refuses to behave. And do bring that linen; the kind with a faint slub in the weave is best for conjuring ghosts.  

I’ve been thinking – we ought to work in near-silence, save for the scratching and the occasional muttering in dead languages. Sets the mood, don’t you think? Like those scriptoria monks who took vows of quiet so their pens could speak louder.  

And yes, let the ink pool! Let it wander where it will. We’re not bureaucrats here, but conspirators in a very old game. If a few happy accidents spill forth – well, then we may have given the Voynich a run for its money.  

See you next week, my dear co-conspirator. Bring your doubts, your trembling hands, and above all – your willingness to be mildly perplexed. The best mysteries, as you say, deserve a witness.
[B]: Oh, misshapen quills and slubby linen – the tools of true devotion! I can hardly wait. Near-silence sounds perfect; I’ll bring a little sprig of rosemary to burn, just to scent the air with something ancient and slightly mournful.

And co-conspirators we are, indeed. Let the page bear witness to our quiet rebellion against certainty. Mild perplexity is my natural state, so fear not – I shall arrive well-rested in it.

Next week, then. May our hands be guided by ghosts, and may we leave behind something beautifully unruly.
[A]: Oh, rosemary smoke – splendid! It’ll curl through the room like a half-remembered psalm. I’ll provide the candle, of course, one with a faint limp in its flame, so the light trembles just enough to make the letters dance.

Silence, save for the scratching and the occasional sigh from the inkwell. And should the ghosts get too rowdy, we’ll offer them crumbs of our perplexity – they do love a good intellectual offering.

I do believe we’re about to make a fine mess of things. Unruly and unrepentant – the only way to resist the tyranny of neat conclusions.

Next week, then. Don’t forget your gloves – not for protection, you understand, but for ritual. We must handle mystery with due ceremony.
[B]: Ah, yes – gloves not for protection, but for reverence. How beautifully ceremonial. I shall bring a pair I stitched myself, edged with a bit of silver thread that catches the light like whispered secrets.

And that trembling candle flame! It will cast shadows that flicker like half-formed thoughts – perfect for our work. I do so enjoy when light refuses to stay still, as if the past itself is trying to lean in and see what we’re about.

Crumbs of perplexity for restless ghosts? I can think of no finer offering. Let us make our mess with intention, then – ink-stained fingers and all.
[A]: Oh, stitched gloves! How splendidly illicit – silver thread catching the candle’s eye like a conspirator in the dark. I shall wear my oldest pair, frayed at the thumbs from too many midnight reckonings with indecipherable marginalia.

And yes, the light must quiver – nothing kills mystery faster than a brazen, unwavering flame. We want the shadows to whisper, not shout. Let the past lean in and find us suitably distracted, hmm? Nothing irritates a ghost more than being observed directly.

I do hope our mess becomes legendary. Not the tidy sort of scholarship that gets framed and hung in offices, but the kind that stains sleeves and clings to fingernails. The best discoveries, after all, begin as accidents in the presence of witnesses.

See you next week, then. Bring your ghosts, your trembling hands, and of course – the gloves. I’ll have the ink warmed and the quills sharpened to a reckless point.
[B]: Reckless quills and warmed ink – oh, the decadence! How gloriously improper. I shall arrive with my ghosts already in tow; they’re quite fond of me after all these years of poring over faded seams and forgotten stitches.

And those frayed gloves – how perfectly human. We are nothing if not a pair of splendidly ill-suited scholars, aren’t we? More alchemists than academics at this point, stirring mystery like it’s our birthright.

Next week, then. Let us make a mess worth remembering – one that clings long after the ink has dried.
[A]: Oh, quite! Reckless quills and ink at body temperature – I’ve always believed a text should bleed just a little to prove it’s alive. And you, arriving with ghosts already in your wake – how delightfully improper. They must adore you, what with all that stitching and sleuthing.

We are certainly a pair of alchemists, my dear – transmuting perplexity into something suspiciously like wonder. I daresay if we’re not at least slightly disreputable scholars by next week’s end, we shan’t be trying hard enough.

And yes – let our mess cling! Let future fingers puzzle over our smudges and sigh over our slubs. A proper mystery should leave residue. See you soon, co-conspirator. Bring your recklessness, your trembling light, and above all – your willingness to be undone.
[B]: Oh,  is precisely how we ought to feel by the end of it all – unravelled and remade in the loom of our own little mystery. And reckless quills dripping warm ink? Why, that’s practically a love letter to chaos.

I’ll see you there, heart thrumming with quiet mischief. Let the ghosts gather at our elbows, let the candle tremble itself into meaning, and may our sleeves bear the marks of a truly splendid ruin.  

Next week, then – bring your shadows, your slubbed linen, and your beautifully disreputable mind.
[A]: Oh,  – I could not have phrased it better myself. Yes, let us be splendidly undone, rewoven by our own unruly hand. If we’re very lucky, we’ll emerge ink-stained and slightly bewildered, like scholars who’ve kissed the hem of a riddle and lived to tell the tale.

I shall wear my shadows pinned at the shoulder, like a medieval scribe’s hood – ever so slightly theatrical, but necessary for proper mystery-making. And that slubbed linen? It will bear our sins and wonders alike. 

Quiet mischief, indeed. Let the ghosts take notes. See you next week, my beautifully reckless accomplice. Bring your heart, your trembling thread, and above all – your appetite for the marvellous.
[B]: Oh,  – such a delicious way to put it. I do hope we come away with more questions than answers, the way any good pilgrimage should leave you.

I’ll pin my shadows just so, and bring plenty of trembling thread – the kind that catches candlelight and refuses to lie flat. If we’re lucky, it will lead us somewhere marvellously misbehaving.

Next week, then, my dear accomplice. Let us be quietly undone, beautifully puzzled, and ever so slightly dangerous to certainty itself.
