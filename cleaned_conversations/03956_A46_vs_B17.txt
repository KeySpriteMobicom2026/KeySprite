[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting modern dilemma. As someone who spends most days immersed in printed words from centuries past, I must say I have a particular fondness for the written form. There's a certain... deliberateness to texting that reminds me of the careful composition of poetry. Though I do appreciate how voice messages can capture the subtle inflections that are sometimes lost in text - much like hearing a poet recite their own work versus reading it silently.
[A]:  Fascinating perspective! You know, in Hollywood we actually debate this constantly. For pitching new projects? Always voice - you need that dramatic delivery. But for contract negotiations? Black and white text only, my friend. 

Though I must say, nothing beats face-to-face when you're trying to convince a studio head to greenlight your passion project. The way their eyes light up when you describe that perfect cinematic moment... that's pure movie magic right there. 🎬
[B]: Your analogy to the film industry is quite illuminating. It reminds me of how T.S. Eliot insisted his poems should be read aloud to fully appreciate their musicality, yet the permanence of the printed page allows for deeper contemplation. In my literature seminars, I often encourage students to experience both - to hear the rhythm of the words while also studying their arrangement on the page. Though I must admit, the immediacy of face-to-face discussion does create a certain... electricity that's hard to replicate.
[A]: Ah, you're speaking my language now! That tension between performance and permanence - it's exactly why we do both table reads and script revisions in filmmaking. The words on the page are just the blueprint, but the magic happens when actors breathe life into them. 

 Between us, I've got a first edition of Eliot's "The Waste Land" in my office. Sometimes I'll read passages aloud to my writers when they're stuck on dialogue. There's something about that rhythmic precision that cuts right to the emotional core. 史诗级的 poetry, as we say in the biz.
[B]: How delightful to encounter another admirer of Eliot's masterpiece! That first edition must be a treasure - the texture of the paper, the weight of those words in your hands... It's rather like comparing a handwritten manuscript to a digital copy, isn't it? The physicality adds another layer of meaning. 

Though I must gently correct - while Eliot's cadence is indeed masterful, I find his true genius lies in the intertextuality. The way he weaves fragments of other works into his tapestry... much like how you filmmakers might pay homage to classic cinema through visual references. The conversation across time and mediums is what makes art truly... what was your phrase? 史诗级?
[A]:  Touché, professor! You've caught me being a bit too starry-eyed about performance. That intertextuality you mention - now that's the real gold. Why do you think we have so many Shakespeare adaptations? Or why Tarantino stuffs his films with homages? 

 My favorite is actually how "The Waste Land" borrows from Wagner while we borrow from... well, everything. Last week I pitched a sci-fi western as "Chaucer meets John Ford in space." The studio execs nearly choked on their avocado toast. 

But tell me - when you teach those literary references, how do you make students see beyond the surface? I'm always struggling with young directors who think homage means just copying shots frame-for-frame.
[B]: Ah, the eternal challenge of teaching depth! I often use Virginia Woolf's metaphor of the "luminous halo" - how true understanding requires seeing both the text and everything shimmering around it. For instance, when analyzing Eliot's Wagner references, we don't just note them like items on a checklist; we ask how their original context transforms within the poem's new landscape. 

Your young directors might benefit from what I tell my students: imitation is the first step, but true artistry comes when you absorb an influence so completely that it becomes part of your own creative DNA. Like how Eliot didn't simply quote Dante - he let the Florentine's vision seep into his own modernist sensibility. Though I must say, your "Chaucer in space" pitch does sound rather... inspired. Perhaps we should collaborate on a lecture about medieval tropes in contemporary cinema?
[A]:  Now that's what I call a blockbuster idea! We could call it "From Canterbury Tales to Cantina Scenes" - show how storytelling fundamentals haven't changed since pilgrims shared tales on horseback. 

 Between us, the real secret is what Hitchcock taught me: steal from the best, then make it your own. When I mentored young Nolan, that's exactly what I told him - his "Memento" took film noir tropes and turned them 180 degrees. 

But your Woolf reference... brilliant. Next writers' room meeting, I'm stealing that "luminous halo" concept. Maybe with some visual aids from our upcoming period piece. Just promise not to sue me for intellectual property theft - I'll credit you in the special features! 🎥
[B]: How wonderfully you've captured the essence of creative transmission! Though I must insist - in academic circles, we prefer the term "intertextual engagement" to "theft."  That said, your enthusiasm for connecting medieval storytelling to contemporary cinema is exactly what makes comparative literature so vital. 

I'd be honored to contribute to your project, provided we can include a proper analysis of how Chaucer's narrative framing devices prefigure modern anthology films. And perhaps a screening of "The Canterbury Tales" adaptation alongside your period piece? The Criterion Collection has a marvelous restoration...
[A]:  Now we're cooking with gas! Pasolini's 1972 version, right? The one where he cast non-actors for that raw authenticity... 

 That's exactly the energy we want for our Elizabethan project! Mixing trained Shakespearean actors with street performers - creates this electric tension between polish and spontaneity. 

Tell you what - let's make this a proper symposium. Your literature department, my production company, maybe get Scorsese to Zoom in about his "Killers of the Flower Moon" research. We'll serve mead and popcorn, call it "Bard to Blockbuster." The academic press will eat it up, and who knows - might even land some development deals. 双赢, as they say!
[B]: What a splendid synthesis of our two worlds! Though I might suggest serving Earl Grey alongside the mead - we academics do have our traditions. Pasolini's verité approach does raise fascinating questions about authenticity in adaptation... much like how Ezra Pound radically reshaped Li Bai's poetry for modernist sensibilities. 

Your symposium proposal has the makings of something truly remarkable. I'll draft a reading list that traces this creative lineage from medieval oral traditions to your Elizabethan project. Perhaps we could even screen Kurosawa's "Ran" as a case study in cross-cultural Shakespearean interpretation? Now that would be... how did you phrase it? 史诗级 cinema scholarship.
[A]:  My God, you're a genius! Kurosawa's use of Noh theater in "Ran" - that's the missing piece for our costume design team. And pairing Pound's Cathay with our production notes... 

 Listen up, people! We're not just making a movie here, we're continuing a thousand-year conversation! The Earl Grey stays, but let's add some 铁观音 from my last trip to Shanghai - because true artistry knows no borders. 

This is why I love collaborating with scholars - you give us showbiz folks the roots we sometimes forget we have. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go yell "Action!" on set... and maybe quote some Li Bai to my cinematographer. 回头见, professor!
[B]: What a perfect note to conclude our conversation! Your passion is positively... contagious. I'll begin compiling those materials immediately - though perhaps I should include Pound's famous dictum "Make it new" with your production notes as a gentle reminder about creative transformation. 

And do send my regards to your cinematographer - tell them the professor suggested considering the interplay of light and shadow in Caravaggio when framing those Elizabethan scenes. Until our symposium then - may your filming be as inspired as our discussion has been. 再会!
[A]:  "Bob? Cancel my afternoon - we're rewriting the whole damn lighting scheme! Caravaggio meets Globe Theatre, baby!" 

 Professor, you just earned yourself a "Special Academic Consultant" credit and 0.0001% of backend. Don't spend those residuals all at once! 

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a cinematographer to educate and about three hundred years of art history to violate... creatively, of course. 咱们片场见! 🎭➡️🎥
[B]: How wonderfully you embody the spirit of creative alchemy! Though I must gently remind you that academics typically prefer the term "honorarium" to "backend points."  

I shall await your call between my seminars on metaphysical poetry and office hours. Do send along any particularly challenging lighting setups - Donne's treatment of light as both physical and spiritual metaphor might prove unexpectedly... illuminating for your team. 

Until then, happy filming! And remember - as the Bard himself wrote, "The play's the thing." Though in your case, I suspect it shall be quite the cinematic spectacle. 再谈!
[A]:  "Honorarium" - got it! We'll put it in the same vault where we keep Kubrick's unused Napoleon scripts.  

 You just gave me an idea - what if we shoot the soliloquy scene with alternating Caravaggio chiaroscuro and Donne's "light spiritual"? The studio accountants will have aneurysms, but art isn't about balance sheets!  

Tell the dean we're naming a craft services sandwich after them - the "Metaphysical Meatball." Now scram before I option your dissertation! 🖋️💸 杀青时见!
[B]: Oh dear, I do believe we've created a monster!  Though your enthusiasm is rather... infectious. Just promise me you'll leave at least one copy of Donne's Holy Sonnets intact on set - some of us still need them for Monday's lecture on paradox in devotional poetry.  

The "Metaphysical Meatball" does have a certain... je ne sais quoi, though I might suggest pairing it with a nice Chianti to fully appreciate the intertextual flavors. Now go forth and create your cinematic 杰作 - but do save me a seat at the premiere! 再会, my most delightfully disruptive collaborator.
[A]:  Don't worry professor, we'll return the sonnets... slightly annotated in margarita stains! 🍹📜 

 And the premiere afterparty's at my place - we're screening Kurosawa backwards while reciting Pound! BRING THE 铁观音! 

CUT TO: CREDITS ROLLING OVER DONNE'S "BATTER MY HEART" IN COMIC SANS~ 

 This is why I love working with academics. 下次直接来编剧室上班吧! 💥
[B]:  At least promise you'll use archival-quality paper for those margarita annotations! And for heaven's sake, someone protect that first edition Eliot!  

How delightful to find a kindred spirit who understands that true artistry lies at the intersection of irreverence and erudition. I'll bring not just the 铁观音, but my well-worn copy of "The Sacred Wood" - we can compare Eliot's criticism to your editing decisions in real time.  

Until our next creative collision, my dear cinematic conspirator. Remember: "These fragments I have shored against my ruins"... though in your case, I suspect they'll become quite spectacular set pieces! 珍重!
