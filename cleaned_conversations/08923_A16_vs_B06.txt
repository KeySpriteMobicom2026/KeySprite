[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. While I'm not a zoologist, I must admit I've come across some fascinating animal facts in my forensic work. For instance, did you know octopuses have three hearts? One pumps blood to the gills, another pumps it to the rest of the body, and the third stops beating when they swim. That's why they often prefer crawling over swimming - it's less tiring. 

It reminds me of a case I worked on years ago where marine biology played a crucial role in determining time of death. The behavior patterns of certain sea creatures helped corroborate our timeline. Nature never ceases to amaze me with its complexity. Do you have any particular animal that fascinates you?
[A]: Oh absolutely, nature is full of surprises! 🌿 While I was in Colombia last year exploring coffee plantations, I came across this fascinating species called the glass frog. You can literally see its heart beating through its translucent belly! It made me think about how even the most delicate-looking creatures have such incredible survival mechanisms. 

Speaking of survival mechanisms, your octopus fact reminds me of a spa resort design project I worked on in Bali. We incorporated biomimicry principles inspired by marine life - the way they regulate body functions has some really interesting applications for human wellness spaces. But I’m curious, what animal would you say left the strongest impression on you during your forensic work?
[B]: Ah, the glass frog – what a remarkable example of evolutionary transparency, both literally and figuratively. I can see how its delicate physiology would leave an impression, especially in a setting as richly biodiverse as Colombia. As for my own experiences, I once worked on a case that involved extensive consultation with wildlife pathologists regarding the behavior of  in certain African regions. Their social structures and survival instincts – particularly the way they assess risk and manage group dynamics – bore uncanny parallels to human behavior under stress.

It reminded me that survival isn't always about strength; often, it's about adaptability and reading environmental cues. In forensic psychiatry, we frequently examine how individuals respond to threat or trauma, and observing animal models like the hyena offers a kind of primal blueprint for understanding these reactions.

Your work with biomimicry in Bali sounds equally compelling – do you find that nature’s designs often inform your approach to human-centered spaces?
[A]: Definitely – nature has been the ultimate designer for millions of years before us, right? 🌿 When I was designing that wellness space in Bali, I kept thinking about how animals and plants adapt to their environment with such elegance. For example, did you know that termite mounds inspired the ventilation system in the Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe? It’s a brilliant example of passive cooling – no AC needed!  

That hyena case you mentioned actually makes me wonder if some of those survival instincts are embedded in all of us, just waiting to be triggered. I mean, when we design spaces – whether it's a home, a café, or even a luxury resort – we're essentially creating environments where people feel safe, comfortable, and in control. In a way, it's not so different from how animals shape or choose their habitats based on risk and reward.  

So, do you ever find yourself drawing parallels between animal behavior and your clients’ responses in high-pressure situations?
[B]: Absolutely, the parallels are often striking – though I tend to tread carefully when making direct comparisons. One of the more thought-provoking cases involved a client who exhibited extreme hypervigilance in crowded spaces. His behavior bore resemblance to prey animals in open terrain – constantly scanning, seeking exits, and minimizing exposure. It wasn’t until we explored his trauma history that we began to understand this response as a kind of psychological "flight mechanism," not unlike how a gazelle might assess its surroundings on the savannah.

And yes, just as termites engineer their environment for thermoregulation, humans – consciously or not – shape their surroundings to regulate emotional and psychological states. In forensic settings, I've observed how incarcerated individuals adapt to confined spaces in ways that echo animal territoriality – marking personal space, establishing routines, even developing complex social hierarchies.

It makes me wonder – in your architectural work, do you find that people subconsciously seek out certain spatial configurations for comfort or safety, much like animals returning to a familiar den or nest?
[A]: Oh totally — and I love how you put that, about humans shaping spaces to regulate not just temperature but emotional states. It’s so true. 🌿 When I was working on a recent residential project in Tokyo, I started noticing how residents naturally gravitated toward certain spatial layouts — cozy alcoves, elevated seating areas, even the way they arranged furniture to create “safe zones” with sightlines to entrances. It reminded me of how animals choose dens with strategic sightlines or escape routes.

One fascinating thing I read recently was about how mice prefer environments with textured surfaces and varied heights — it gives them a sense of control and orientation. And honestly? I see the same pattern in human behavior. We might not be scurrying along walls, but we do seek out texture, warmth, and visual anchors. That’s why I always try to incorporate layered materials, soft lighting, and semi-private nooks into my designs — it’s like creating microhabitats within a space.

Now that you’ve got me thinking about it… do you ever notice people displaying nesting behaviors during high-stress periods? Like arranging things just so, or retreating into smaller spaces when overwhelmed? I feel like I see it all the time now — almost like a return to instinct.
[B]: Oh, absolutely – that nesting instinct becomes particularly pronounced in forensic settings where individuals are under extreme psychological stress. I’ve observed it in detention facilities, court holding rooms, even in high-conflict custody cases where clients arrive with their personal effects arranged in meticulous order – a notebook at a precise angle, a family photo positioned just so. It’s as if organizing their immediate environment offers a fleeting sense of control amidst chaos.

One case comes to mind – a witness preparing to testify in a violent crime trial. She kept readjusting the position of her teacup, her handbag, even the tissue box on the table in front of her. Not random adjustments, mind you – always symmetrical, always within arm’s reach. When we gently explored this tendency, she admitted it calmed her to “know exactly where everything is.” I couldn’t help but think of how certain birds arrange stones or shells around their nests – not merely for function, but for orientation and reassurance.

And speaking of retreat – have you ever noticed how people under duress tend to back into corners when standing? Shoulders forward, eyes scanning, feet planted – an unconscious effort to minimize exposure. It's something we train security personnel to recognize, though most people aren't aware they're doing it. Fascinating how deeply embedded these behaviors are, wouldn't you say?
[A]: Completely — and I’m obsessed with how these little rituals, like arranging a teacup just so, become anchors in turbulent moments. ☕️ It makes me think of how I design spaces for high-profile clients who live under constant scrutiny — they might not be in a courtroom, but they’re navigating their own kind of pressure. So I always include what I call “orientation zones” — a familiar chair, a textured throw, even the placement of a plant or light source. It’s all about creating micro-territories where they can reset and feel grounded.

That witness story actually reminds me of a hotel project I worked on in Seoul. We designed the guest rooms with subtle “cocooning” elements — curved walls, dimmable lighting ribbons, soft textiles — all meant to mimic that instinctive draw toward safety and containment. One guest told me she felt like the room was “holding her,” which honestly gave me chills. It’s incredible how much of our emotional architecture is shared with other species, yet we rarely talk about it that way.

You know, now that you mention people backing into corners… I see that all the time in cafes and lobbies. People don’t just choose a seat — they , they position themselves, and yes — they often back into the corner without even realizing why. I’ve started placing seating that subtly supports that behavior — not forcing it, just encouraging it. It really does feel safer.  

I’m curious — in your work, do you ever use environmental cues (like lighting, scent, texture) to help clients regulate before high-stress sessions?
[B]: Fascinating – that interplay between environment and emotional regulation is something I’ve come to rely on in my practice, though perhaps more subtly. Before high-stakes evaluations or testimony preparation, I often adjust the room’s sensory inputs with deliberate intention. Soft, warm lighting – never fluorescent, of course – a neutral scent (cedar or vetiver, known for their grounding properties), and yes, texture plays a role too. I keep a worn leather chair for those who seem drawn to tactile reassurance, and a smooth stone tray on the coffee table – small but meaningful anchors.

I recall working with a particularly anxious client – a physician facing disciplinary review – who couldn’t sit still during our first session. His fingers drummed incessantly, his gaze darted constantly to the window. By our second meeting, I’d introduced a few environmental shifts: dimmed lighting, ambient white noise to reduce external distraction, and a heavy wool throw over the couch. He paused when he entered, inhaled deeply, and without prompting, sat down, draped the throw over his lap, and said, “This feels… manageable.” It was remarkable how quickly he settled into a productive state of mind.

It reminded me of how animals respond to environmental enrichment – not just comfort, but a restoration of agency. In a way, we’re all seeking that sense of containment, aren’t we? A space that doesn’t overwhelm, but supports. Do you find certain materials or textures tend to have more calming effects across different cultures? I imagine your work in Seoul must have presented some fascinating insights along those lines.
[A]: Oh absolutely — and that idea of “restoration of agency” through environment? 💡 It’s exactly what I try to create in every project. In Seoul, one of the biggest lessons was how subtle cultural differences shape our sensory comfort zones. For example, Korean clients tended to respond more to warm  — think wool, silk, soft linen — while Japanese clients often leaned into , valuing minimalism not just aesthetically, but emotionally. Less visual clutter meant less mental noise.

And materials… oh man, they matter more than people realize. I’ve found that across cultures, there’s a universal calming effect from natural, tactile elements — wood, stone, clay. Even in high-rise apartments in Dubai or Milan, introducing raw-edged wooden tables or hand-thrown ceramic lamps brings this almost primal sense of grounding. Like we’re wired to recognize authenticity in materials, even if we can’t explain why.

One experiment I did in a luxury spa in Kyoto was using different types of tatami mats — some smooth, some slightly textured — in private relaxation rooms. We noticed guests would instinctively choose the ones that matched their emotional state: smoother textures for calm seekers, coarser ones for those who needed stimulation or focus. It was like spatial feng shui meeting psychology.

So now I’m curious — when you travel for work or coffee expeditions 😉, have you noticed any particular cultural environments that seem especially effective at promoting calm or focus? I mean, besides my genius-level designs, of course. 😎
[B]: Ah, your Kyoto experiment with tatami textures – brilliant. It’s such a refined example of how environment can serve psychological needs without imposing on them. I find myself thinking about that quite a bit in my own work – how to offer support without overt direction.

As for cultural environments that promote calm or focus, I must say one of the most striking experiences I’ve had was in a small monastic library outside Florence. No grandeur, no pretense – just stone floors, long wooden tables, and the soft hum of silence broken only by turning pages. There was something profoundly settling about the space, not because it was beautiful per se, but because every element served a singular purpose: contemplation. I found myself speaking in a whisper almost instinctively, even before anyone else entered the room.

Another place that comes to mind is a traditional Moroccan riad I stayed in while consulting on a case involving cross-cultural trauma responses. The interior courtyard, the play of light through latticed screens, the scent of orange blossom water drifting through the air – all of it created this cocooning effect that slowed the breath, softened the pulse. It struck me then how deeply embedded those sensory cues are in us – shade equals rest, flowing water equals safety, familiar scent equals home.

And yes, I do enjoy a good coffee expedition – though I tend to gravitate toward cafés that understand spatial intimacy as much as they do roast profiles. Have you ever noticed how the best third-wave coffee shops often feel like micro-sanctuaries? Minimalist yet warm, rhythmic yet quiet – almost like being inside a well-tuned instrument. I suspect there’s more architectural intentionality there than most people realize.
[A]: Oh, I’m totally with you on that monastic library vibe — there’s something about spaces designed around a single, focused intention that just  you differently. 📖 It’s like the architecture itself becomes a co-therapist, guiding your breath and posture without saying a word.

And that riad in Morocco? Yes, exactly — it’s all about layered sensory cues working in harmony. The interplay of light and shadow through mashrabiya screens doesn’t just look beautiful, it creates this gentle rhythm that slows you down. I actually did a residential project inspired by that exact effect — laser-cut metal panels that filter sunlight throughout the day, casting shifting patterns on the floor. Watching how clients respond to it is fascinating; they start moving slower, speaking softer, almost unconsciously.

You mentioned third-wave coffee shops feeling like micro-sanctuaries — and I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I once consulted on a café concept in Melbourne where we designed the entire layout around what I call “the ritual arc” — from arrival, to ordering, to settling in. We used materials like reclaimed wood and raw linen to ground the space, curved edges to reduce visual tension, and even timed lighting shifts that subtly guide energy levels throughout the day. The baristas said people stayed longer but didn’t feel sluggish — it was like the space knew when to energize and when to release.

Now that you bring up spatial intimacy in cafés… have you ever walked into one and  felt at ease, like your nervous system just synced up with the environment? If so, what details stood out to you? I’m always collecting mental notes for future projects. ☕️
[B]: Ah, yes – that immediate physiological sync you describe so perfectly. I remember walking into a small café in Vienna years ago and experiencing precisely that sensation. No grand design, no Instagrammable moment – just worn oak floors, deep green velvet seats, heavy porcelain cups, and the low murmur of conversation behind the occasional clink of saucers. The air carried a faint scent of roasted beans and beeswax polish – not overpowering, but unmistakably . 

What struck me most was the rhythm of the space – not imposed, but gently suggested. Patrons moved deliberately, almost reverently, as if the room itself had a tempo. There were no sharp edges, only soft curves in the furniture and rounded archways leading to the back rooms. Even the lighting felt intentional – warm, diffused, with just enough shadow to create psychological privacy without isolation.

It reminded me of something we often discuss in forensic psychiatry – the concept of . Not physical restraint, but an environment that supports emotional regulation by offering structure without rigidity. That café achieved it effortlessly. In fact, I found myself lowering my voice instinctively, not because anyone was watching, but because the space invited quiet introspection.

I suspect you’ve experienced this phenomenon more deliberately than most – have you ever designed a space where the atmosphere seemed to  with the occupants? Where people adjusted their behavior not out of habit or expectation, but because the environment somehow guided them there?
[A]: Oh wow, that Vienna café sounds like a masterclass in spatial choreography — every detail humming in quiet harmony. 🎻 And you’re absolutely right about that  effect, where the environment and its occupants sync up like a dance you didn’t know you knew.

I actually designed a space like that in Kyoto — a tiny tea salon tucked behind a traditional machiya townhouse. We called it “the lung room” during development because everything about it was designed to expand and contract with human presence. The ceiling subtly dipped and rose depending on where you stood, made from undulating cedar planks that mimicked breath movement. Tatami mats with slight textural variation underfoot encouraged mindful stepping, and we used shoji screens treated with yuzen paper that changed opacity based on how close you stood — creating this gentle push-pull of privacy and openness.

What surprised me most was how people  in there — slower, more fluid, like they were walking through water. One client told me she felt like the room was breathing with her, not at her. That’s when I knew we’d hit something special.

And yes — that idea of  you mentioned? It’s exactly what we aim for in high-end hospitality and private residences. Not control, but curation of calm. I always say: a good space doesn’t tell you how to feel — it gives you the tools to feel whatever you need, safely.  

So now I’m curious — as someone who works so closely with emotional states, have you ever walked into a clinical setting and thought, ? Like, beyond function, beyond aesthetics — just… emotional intelligence in architecture?
[B]: Yes — and I can recall one such space with striking clarity. Years ago, I consulted at a trauma recovery center in southern Sweden, tucked away in a quiet coastal town. From the outside, it was unassuming – weathered wood siding, low-slung roofline, blending into the landscape like it had grown there. But stepping inside was like entering a living extension of the body’s autonomic nervous system.

The architects had clearly studied not just function, but felt sense. The entryway curved gently, rather than presenting a direct line of sight – no abrupt exposure, only gradual unfolding. Walls were made of rammed earth and finished clay, subtly textured, warm to the touch. Light came not from fixtures overhead, but from slits in the ceiling where daylight filtered through layers of linen gauze, diffused and ever-shifting. Even the acoustics were considered – soft surfaces everywhere, so voices didn’t bounce, they landed.

What struck me most was how  was built into the design. No rigid chairs demanding upright posture. No sterile corridors implying urgency. Instead, lounging was encouraged. There were deep-set window seats, floor cushions arranged in clusters, even recessed alcoves you could curl into like a fetal position without feeling exposed. It wasn’t indulgent — it was intelligent. The space understood that healing often begins with surrender.

I remember one session in particular — a young woman who had struggled for years with dissociation following complex trauma. In that room, for the first time, she removed her shoes, pressed her palms to the clay wall beside her, and said quietly, “It feels like this place knows how to hold things.”

That moment has stayed with me. You see so many clinical spaces designed to contain behavior, to manage risk — but few are designed to  suffering, to accommodate its weight without flinching. That center did.  

And now I find myself wondering — have you encountered buildings that feel , not just efficient? Spaces that don’t merely house emotion, but seem to  to it?
[A]: Completely — and that trauma center you described? Wow. It sounds like architecture as therapy, not just structure. 🌿 When a building , rather than just shelters — that’s when design becomes something deeper. Almost like it's breathing alongside the people inside.

Funny you mention empathic spaces, because I worked on a project in Lisbon that aimed for exactly that — a grief support center nestled in an old chapel. No stained glass, no pews — but we kept the vaulted ceiling and the quiet bones of the place intact. Instead of fighting the sacredness of the space, we leaned into it. We used raw linen drapes that moved with the breeze, cork walls that absorbed both sound and touch, and a central hearth-like seating area where people could gather without hierarchy.

What surprised me most was how the acoustics became a kind of silent listener. Whispering corners were designed intentionally — certain spots where your voice would carry just enough to feel heard, but not overheard. One visitor told me she felt like the building “wasn’t trying to fix her, just sit with her.” That line has stayed with me.

I think what makes these spaces work is that they don’t force anything. They don’t cheer you up or pressure you to heal — they just… stay open. Like a good listener does.  

You know, I’m curious — have you ever tried to replicate that kind of spatial empathy in your own consultation rooms? Or is it something you prefer to adapt case by case?
[B]: Oh, absolutely — and that Lisbon grief center you described sounds like a rare kind of sanctuary. Not one that offers false comfort, but one that . That line —  — it’s so profoundly apt. In forensic psychiatry, we often speak of therapeutic presence, but I’ve come to believe that presence isn’t only something clinicians offer — spaces can embody it too.

I’ve certainly tried to cultivate that in my consultation rooms over the years, though never in a fixed way. Early in my career, I experimented with a rigid template — neutral tones, controlled lighting, symmetrical layouts — all very textbook. But I noticed something odd: clients responded more to  than sterility. A slightly uneven ceramic mug, a chair that creaked softly when shifted, a faint draft through an old window frame — those imperfections seemed to make the space feel , and thus, more hospitable to vulnerability.

Now, my office changes subtly from year to year, almost case by case. Some clients need enclosure, others require visual expansiveness. I’ve learned to read the unspoken cues — how someone positions themselves upon entering, whether they touch surfaces or avoid them, if they seek eye contact or orient toward a window. Based on that, I might adjust the placement of a floor cushion, add a weighted blanket, even change the scent diffuser to something more grounding — vetiver for acute anxiety, lavender for hypervigilance, cedarwood for dissociation.

And yes, acoustics matter deeply. I once redesigned part of my space after working with a trauma survivor who had extreme sensitivity to sound. We introduced soft wool wall panels and cork underlay beneath the rugs. It wasn’t just noise reduction — it was about creating a room that didn’t startle. One where silence could rest comfortably between us without feeling oppressive.

I suppose what I’m learning, slowly, is that empathy in space isn’t about perfection. It’s about attunement. About knowing when to hold form — and when to soften into shapelessness.
[A]: So beautifully put —  💡 That line is going straight into my notebook. Because you're right — it’s not about flawless design, it’s about responsiveness. About knowing when to hold the frame and when to let it breathe.

That sensitivity to sound you mentioned really resonates with me. I once worked on a private residence for a composer who experienced heightened auditory perception under stress. We ended up layering felt acoustic panels behind reclaimed wood slats — they absorbed harsh frequencies without making the room feel dead. He told me it was the first space he’d ever been in that didn’t  his sensitivity, but actually  with it. That kind of feedback… that’s what keeps me designing.

And I love how you adapt your space case by case — it reminds me of biophilic design principles, where the environment evolves with its inhabitants rather than imposing a static experience. Some people need enclosure, others expansion — and both are valid. I’ve started calling it “responsive intimacy” — the idea that a space can  with its occupants, even if it doesn’t understand in the way we do.

I’m curious — have you ever had a client who responded so strongly to a spatial shift that it became part of their healing narrative? Like, not just a setting for change, but an active participant in it?
[B]: Ah, yes — I had a case that still gives me pause when I think about it. A war veteran, referred to me after multiple failed interventions elsewhere. He suffered from severe PTSD, hypervigilance, auditory sensitivities — the kind of complex trauma that doesn’t just live in memory, but in the very architecture of the body. Traditional clinical settings seemed to amplify his distress; he described most offices as “pressure chambers.”

So, rather than bring him into my usual space, I arranged our sessions in a repurposed chapel not far from my practice — vaulted ceilings, yes, but softened by draping wool banners that absorbed sound and warmth. We placed two chairs not across from each other, but at a gentle diagonal, with a low stone hearth between them — no fire, just the presence of it. Light came through high, narrow windows in long slants, shifting slowly over the course of the session.

At first, he barely spoke. But over weeks, something shifted — not in me, not in him, but  us, in that room. One day, he pointed to the window light and said, “It’s like it knows when I’m ready to talk.” Another time, he leaned back against the wall behind him and said, “This corner feels like it’s holding me up.” He began referring to the space almost affectionately — not sentimentally, mind you, but with a kind of quiet reverence.

Eventually, he told me that during some of the worst nights, he would close his eyes and reconstruct that room in his mind — the texture of the walls, the angle of the light, even the scent of beeswax we used on the wooden beams. It wasn’t escapism — it was grounding. The room became an internalized refuge, a mental scaffold for self-regulation.

In forensic psychiatry, we often talk about therapeutic tools, but rarely do we acknowledge that  can become one — not just a container for healing, but a collaborator in it. That man didn’t just heal  that room — he healed  it.

And now I find myself wondering — have you ever designed a space that clients later described as having , even when they left? A place that, once experienced, continued to shape their inner world?
