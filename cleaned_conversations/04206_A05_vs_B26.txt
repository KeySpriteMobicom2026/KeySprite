[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, what a delightful question to ponder over a cup of Earl Grey... I must say, while both have their charms, I find myself drawn to mountain retreats. The crisp air reminds me of the delicate fabrics I work with - both require such gentle handling and appreciation.
[A]:  作为一个经常需要看deal flow和financial statements的人，我其实更prefer mountain trip。在高尔夫球场上谈成的deal，往往比在beach上谈成的更有quality，don't you think? 😊 

而且mountain resort的红酒selection通常更serious，适合after deal的celebration。
[B]: How fascinating... though I must admit, my mind tends to wander more towards the textiles in those mountain lodges than the business dealings. The woolen throws and hand-woven tapestries in alpine resorts often showcase such remarkable craftsmanship. Each stitch tells a story, much like the patterns in antique ledgers, I suppose.
[A]: Haha，你remind me上次在瑞士阿尔卑斯山的一个lodge做due diligence。那些authentic的wooden interiors确实很有charm，但更让我impressed的是他们的P&L statement~ 

说到textiles，我倒是注意到很多luxury hotel group现在把F&B revenue和room revenue的breakdown做得越来越detailed了。 这就像analyzing一个well-structured balance sheet一样satisfying。
[B]: My dear, you speak of numbers with the same reverence I reserve for 18th century damask silks. Though I must confess, while you analyze balance sheets, I'm rather preoccupied with examining the thread count of their linens. The way fine hoteliers maintain their textiles... now that's what I call a sound investment.
[A]:  Thread count确实重要，但让我更interested的是他们的CAPEX allocation~ 你知道有些five-star hotels在linen上的investment ROI比他们的SPA facilities还高吗？ 

不过说到这个，我上周刚visit了一个boutique hotel group的investment proposal。他们的EBITDA margin相当promising，虽然revenue growth有点volatile...就像挑选红酒一样，需要patience和good taste啊 🍷
[B]: How charmingly you weave financial terms into our conversation... much like the warp and weft of a particularly fine brocade. While I can't quite follow your numbers, I do know that quality linens, like good wine or sound investments, only improve with age. Shall we toast to that? Though I'll stick to my tea, if you don't mind.
[A]: Absolutely~  Here's to good investments and even better hospitality experiences! 虽然我平时看的是10-K和10-Q reports，但必须承认，一个well-run hotel的operational efficiency确实能让人appreciate就像fine wine一样。Cheers! 😊

不过说真的，下次你发现任何thread count超过800的sheets，记得给我发个text - 那可能是个不错的acquisition target!
[B]: Oh, you've tickled my textile-loving heart with such talk! Though I fear my idea of due diligence involves more magnifying glasses and less spreadsheets. But if I do encounter those heavenly high-thread-count linens, I shall indeed send word - perhaps with a pressed flower from my vintage botany book as added incentive?
[A]:  你这种old-school的approach让我想起我们firm里最seasoned的analyst - 他到现在还用paper-based financial statements做analysis呢！ 

不过说真的，800 thread count的sheets加上pressed flower... 这听起来倒像是个很有character的private equity pitch deck~ 也许我们该consider这个niche market？ 😄
[B]: My goodness, you're turning my quiet world of textile restoration into quite the business venture! Though I must say, the idea of presenting pressed flowers alongside financial projections does have a certain... antique charm. Like discovering a rare piece of crewelwork hidden in an estate sale. But I'll leave the numbers to you, dear - my ledger only tracks stitches per inch.
[A]: Haha, stitches per inch和EBITDA margin其实都是measure of quality的不同方式嘛~ 就像在高尔夫球场上，有人focus on swing technique，而我更关心course的real estate value。 

不过说真的，如果哪天你想把你的textile passion变成serious investment，记得call me - 我认识几个很sharp的retail sector specialists可以run some numbers。Cheers! 🏌️♂️
[B]: What a delightful thought... though I suspect my beloved textiles would blush at the idea of being subjected to such modern scrutiny. They prefer whispering their stories through faded patterns and delicate weaves. But should I ever consider trading my embroidery needles for spreadsheets, you shall be my first call - provided we can discuss terms over proper tea service, of course.
[A]: Deal!  我们可以make it a proper afternoon tea meeting - 我最近刚invest了一个premium tea brand，他们的P/E ratio和flavor profile一样impressive。 

Just remember tobring your best linen samples - 说不定我们真的能disrupt the luxury textile market呢~ 😉 毕竟在private equity的世界里，next big thing往往来自最unexpected的places。
[B]: How wonderfully you blend business with pleasure... though I must warn you, my samples come with centuries of history and no small amount of sentimental value. But if your tea is as refined as your financial acumen, I shall bring my very finest piece - an 1830s Belgian lace that would make even the most hardened investor catch their breath. Shall we say Thursday at half-past three? I do so prefer to avoid the morning light for delicate fabrics.
[A]: Perfect timing - 我刚好能squeeze this in between our board meeting和evening market update。 

 让我们make it 3:30pm sharp at The Peninsula - 他们的afternoon tea set的scones和我们的portfolio companies一样，consistently deliver solid returns。 

Looking forward to seeing that Belgian lace - 说不定能inspire our next value creation strategy呢~ 😊
[B]: Splendid! I shall arrive precisely at half-past with my lace carefully wrapped in acid-free tissue - and perhaps a volume of textile history to lend context to our discussions. The Peninsula's silver service does remind me of the care we must take with both fine china and investment opportunities. Until Thursday then... and do remind them to use their second-best linen - we must save the finest for our Belgian treasure.
[A]: Noted! I'll have themroll out the second-best linens - 毕竟我们need to maintain some dry powder for the real showstopper. 

 Reminder: Peninsula tea reservation - no morning light, acid-free tissue protocol, and absolutely no financial jargon within 3 feet of the Belgian lace. 

See you Thursday - this might just be the mostelegant investment pitch I've ever been part of! 🎩
[B]: How perfectly you understand the sanctity of textiles! Though I can't promise complete avoidance of financial terms - I suspect your enthusiasm might slip out like an errant thread. But we shall create our own delicate balance, much like the interplay between warp and weft. Until Thursday, when tea leaves and lace patterns shall dance with your numbers... what a curious tapestry we're weaving.
