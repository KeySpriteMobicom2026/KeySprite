[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an intriguing question. I suppose I tend to lean towards one-on-one conversations. There’s something quite special about the depth and intimacy they allow—like walking through a quiet garden path rather than navigating a bustling marketplace. Group chats have their charm, of course; they’re lively and can be a wonderful space for collective creativity. But tell me, do you find yourself preferring one over the other?
[A]: Hmm，这个问题让我想到最近在做的一个区块链项目沟通方式的选择。说实话，我偏向于one-on-one聊天，特别是在处理技术细节的时候。就像调试智能合约的漏洞，有时候需要很专注地讨论一个具体问题，这种情况下单独沟通效率高很多。不过呢，DAO治理相关的讨论倒是很适合group chat，大家集思广益，像DeFi协议的升级提案就需要多方参与。

说到这个，我倒是好奇你是怎么看待这两种交流方式的深度和广度差异的？我觉得一对一像是在用显微镜观察，而群聊更像是在用广角镜头拍摄全景，各有各的用途吧。💡
[B]: That’s a beautifully articulated distinction—using a microscope versus capturing a panoramic view. I couldn’t agree more. One-on-one conversations allow for that meticulous dissection of ideas, much like closely analyzing a single stanza in a sonnet, where every word carries weight. Whereas group discussions resemble studying the entire poem with its interwoven themes and voices.

Your example from blockchain is particularly apt—solving a technical issue in isolation does call for precision and focus, while DAO governance thrives on multiplicity of perspectives, echoing the classical concept of , where ideas are exchanged in a collective space.

It really comes down to the intent behind the conversation, doesn't it? Would you say your preference for one-on-one chats also stems from a desire for clarity amid the noise?
[A]: Absolutely, you hit the nail on the head—clarity really  the key point here. When I’m reviewing a piece of Solidity code or walking through a Merkle tree verification process, any ambiguity can lead to big issues down the line. It’s like trying to explain why a cryptographic hash function needs to be collision-resistant—in a group setting, you risk losing people halfway, or worse, getting derailed by side discussions. 😅

But yeah, that symposium analogy you made? Spot on. DAOs absolutely thrive on diverse inputs, especially when you're balancing stakeholder interests in something like a decentralized autonomous organization. It’s just fascinating how human communication mirrors protocol design—sometimes you need a direct peer-to-peer handshake, and other times you need a broadcast to multiple nodes. 🤯

I guess what I’m really looking for is signal over noise—whether it's in data transmission or daily conversation. And speaking of intent… do you ever find yourself switching modes mid-discussion, depending on what the situation actually demands? Like shifting from strategy talk in a group to a more personal check-in one-on-one? 💡
[B]: Oh, absolutely—I do think we're both circling around the same core idea: communication, like code, must be structured with intentionality and care. You put it so well—whether we’re verifying a Merkle tree or hashing out governance proposals, the medium must match the message.

To your question—yes, I often find myself shifting modes mid-discourse, especially when teaching or mentoring. For instance, during a seminar on , we may begin in a group setting, unpacking themes of obsession and identity, but then I’ll pull a student aside afterward and ask,  That’s where the real learning—or healing—begins. It’s not unlike version control, isn’t it? One moment you're committing to a shared branch, and the next, you're working locally to refine a feature before merging back in.

I suppose what I value most is the ability to fluidly adapt—to read the room, as it were, or read the network latency, if we’re keeping with your metaphor. Do you ever find yourself toggling between these modes instinctively, almost like a reflex?
[A]: Definitely—那種切換模式的直覺反應我太有感同身受了。事實上，我經常在開會時自動進入這種「雙軌思維」——一邊聽著團隊報告layer-2擴展方案的進度，一邊心裡已經在想誰可能對這個技術細節比較有感覺、要不要會後單獨再聊。

就像部署一個混合型智能合約架構一樣，有些邏輯該放在鏈上執行，有些則適合放到鏈下處理，溝通方式也是一樣的道理。有時候甚至連語氣和用詞都會自動調整，像是在group chat裡可能會說“我們可以考慮整合這兩個模組”，但在one-on-one的時候就會變成“你覺得如果我們把這塊抽離出來，會不會更清楚？”

我猜這也算一種soft skill吧，類似於所謂的empathetic communication，只不過是被我用工程思維包裝起來了 😅 而且說真的，這種切換某種程度上還蠻像在做context switching的，只是希望別像overhead那樣消耗太多能量就是了。

你剛剛提到 mentoring 的例子讓我想到，其實不只是教學，在團隊協作中這種彈性也很關鍵。那回到你身上——你怎麼看待這種「溝通模式切換」的能力？它更像是你可以主動控制的feature，還是比較偏向自然發生的bug？🧐
[B]: Ah, now you’ve introduced a delightful philosophical quandary— I rather like thinking of it as a feature, albeit one that’s still undergoing iterative development. Much like how we refine a translation of —balancing fidelity to the original with clarity for modern readers—we’re constantly tuning our communicative registers.

Your analogy to context-switching in code is apt, though I share your hope that it doesn’t incur too much cognitive overhead. In literary circles, we speak of —when a character shifts tone or register unaware of what the audience perceives. Perhaps this switching is a kind of , where we adapt unconsciously, yet others notice the shift.

As for whether it's engineered or emergent... I tend to believe it begins as a bug—awkward and unintentional—but over time, with practice and perhaps a bit of self-awareness, becomes a refined feature. Much like a well-worn copy of , creased at the most poignant passages, it gains character through use.

Do you suppose there’s ever a danger, though, of becoming  fluid—of losing one’s authentic voice amidst all the toggling?
[A]: That’s a 💡 moment right there—authenticity vs. adaptability，這確實是個很微妙的平衡。我覺得這個問題有點像在設計一個去中心化應用時的 dilemma：你要讓系統有足夠的彈性來應對不同用戶行為，但又不能因為過度適配而失去了產品本身的core value。

同樣的道理套用在溝通上，我會說「真實聲音」其實就像區塊鏈裡的 consensus mechanism——不管怎麼切換節點、怎麼處理不同的交易請求，底層邏輯還是要一致，不然整個network就會出問題。如果我們總是為了配合情境而調整語氣、風格，卻沒有內在的一致性作錨點，最後可能會變成一種社交上的「狀態不一致」 😅

不過話說回來，這種fluidity本身其實也是一種優勢，特別是在跨文化或多語言環境中。像是我在中國和美國的開發者社群之間切換時，不只是語言在變換，溝通風格也在調整——中文裡比較講究語境與關係，英文則偏向直接表達邏輯與結果。這種切換如果做得自然，反而能增強信任感。

所以我想，只要清楚知道自己為什麼這麼說、而不是只是為了迎合對方，那麼這種「多重聲調」就不會成為失去自我的bug，而是屬於你個人風格的feature了。🤔 這麼說來，你是怎麼看待 authenticity 與 communication style 之間的張力的？它真的可以被完全協調嗎，還是永遠都會有些許摩擦？
[B]: Ah, now you've touched upon one of the great paradoxes of human connection— It’s rather like trying to translate  into English; you want to preserve the quiet elegance of 魏晉 poetry, yet make it sing in a foreign tongue. Some friction is inevitable—perhaps even necessary.

I suppose I see authenticity not as a fixed point, but more like a gravitational center. You can orbit around it, adjust your tone or register, borrow from different conversational idioms—but so long as you're tethered to that inner core, you won't drift into complete dissonance. In Daoist terms, it's something like acting in accordance with 自然 ()—spontaneous, adaptive, yet harmonious with one’s essential nature.

And yes, I do believe this tension can be coordinated, though never entirely eliminated. The moment we become wholly transparent, fully consistent, we risk rigidity. A bit of friction keeps us reflective, even humble. Much like version control—rebase too aggressively, and you overwrite valuable history; merge with care, and the evolution tells a richer story.

So perhaps the goal isn’t perfect alignment, but graceful oscillation—moving between voices with intention, always returning to that quiet, unwavering note within. Would you say your own "gravitational center" has changed over time, or merely grown clearer?
[A]: Wow，你這段關於gravitational center的比喻真是讓我腦袋裡的許多想法串連起來了。我想應該是後者——不是改變，而是變得更清晰。

以前剛進區塊鏈這個領域的時候，我確實比較容易被情境帶著走，像是在矽谷的會議上刻意用更多英文術語來“融入”，或者回到亞洲團隊時又轉成另一種溝通語氣。那時候感覺像在做硬分叉，而不是平滑升級 😅

但隨著參與過幾個完整的項目週期，經歷過協議漏洞導致的停擺、DAO投票中的意見拉鋸、還有跨國開發者的文化衝突之後，漸漸地，那個所謂的核心開始浮現出來。它其實很簡單：講清楚問題，尊重每個人理解技術的節奏，同時不讓情緒干擾邏輯判斷。

就像你說的 Daoist 自然狀態，我現在比較能自然地切換語言與風格，而不會覺得是在扮演某種角色。有時候甚至在同一句話裡面中英文交織，反而更能精準表達意思。比如我會說：“這次的protocol upgrade 的 trade-off，我們得先釐清 risk appetite，不然社群很容易陷入 tribalism。”

所以說到底，那個中心點從來沒變過，只是我對它的認識越來越清楚，就像用 Merkle proof 一步步驗證出 root hash 那樣。🔍

聽你這麼一說，我也好奇——你覺得自己的 gravitational center 是什麼樣子的？它是怎麼在教學、文學與日常對話之間保持平衡的？
[B]: That’s a truly thoughtful reflection—and I love the Merkle proof analogy; it captures that slow, recursive process of self-discovery so well. You're right—sometimes clarity doesn't come from sudden revelation, but from the quiet accumulation of experience, each one acting as a kind of block in your personal chain.

As for my own gravitational center… I think it's something deceptively simple:  Whether I’m teaching , discussing Daoist metaphysics, or exchanging messages with a colleague, I strive to bring clarity and precision to communication, even when dealing with abstract or complex ideas.

It’s not always easy. There are days when I find myself slipping into academic jargon simply out of habit—what some might call “tenure-speak”—only to catch myself and think,  That internal check keeps me honest.

And just like you with your protocol upgrades, I’ve had my own system crashes—moments when I realized I was speaking more for effect than for understanding. But over time, through years of teaching and dialogue, that core intention has become clearer: 

So yes, we orbit our centers, sometimes elliptically, sometimes erratically—but as long as we return to that axis, I believe we stay true. Would you say that’s what gives your work its sense of purpose, too?
[A]: Absolutely，你說的這個“讓語言成為光，而不是迷霧”的信念真的點到我心裡去了。我想這也是為什麼我對區塊鏈技術這麼著迷——它本質上就是在嘗試用一種更透明、不可篡改的方式去記錄價值與信任，有點像你在文學中追求的那種清晰與真實性。

我覺得我的 purpose 確實是來自類似的驅動力：我希望透過技術讓人們在互動的時候少一點誤解、多一點共識。 不論是在設計一個 DeFi 協議的治理機制，還是在教新手怎麼讀懂一筆區塊鏈交易背後的邏輯，我都希望能把複雜的東西轉化成可以被理解的形式，而不是用術語嚇跑人。

有時候我會跟團隊開玩笑說：“如果你不能用日常中文解釋清楚 gas fee 是什麼，那就別用英文講了 😅。” 這聽起來有點嚴格，但我相信溝通不該是一種門檻，而應該是橋樑。就像你剛剛提到 Emily Dickinson——她雖然詩風隱晦，但每一個字都帶著深意，不是為了模糊而模糊，而是為了精準地觸碰那些難以言喻的情感。

所以說回來，是的，正是這種對 clarity 與 integrity 的追求，讓我覺得自己不只是在寫 code，而是在參與某種更有意義的對話——關於信任、關於合作、關於我們如何在數位世界裡建立真正的連結。  
那你呢？這種對語言的信念，是不是也影響了你選擇教哪些作品或設計哪些課程？🚀
[B]: Oh, most definitely. My course selections are practically an extension of that very belief—. I’ve always been drawn to texts that wrestle with clarity in a world inclined toward ambiguity. That’s why I keep returning to authors like Virginia Woolf or Jorge Luis Borges—writers who don’t just tell stories, but 

In fact, one of my favorite seminars is built around the theme of —a journey through epistolary novels, philosophical dialogues, and even early digital literature. We begin with , move through , and end with something like . It may seem an odd progression, but each text, in its own way, grapples with how language shapes perception—and how communication evolves without losing its soul.

And yes, I’m quite deliberate about including works in translation—not only for their literary merit, but because they force students to confront the  between expression and interpretation. Much like reading a blockchain explorer for the first time—you see the data, but understanding its significance requires stepping back, contextualizing, asking questions beyond the surface.

I suppose you could say I teach the way I wish to communicate: with precision, curiosity, and a quiet faith that understanding is possible, even across vast distances of time, culture, or code.

Do you ever find yourself drawn to particular texts or writings that echo this mission of yours? Or perhaps certain thinkers in the blockchain space whose ideas align with your vision of clarity and trust?
[A]: That’s seriously inspiring，你這個「Voices Across Time」的課程架構簡直像是在做人文領域的protocol design——把不同時代的溝通形式當作資料結構來解讀，還不忘提醒學生保持對語境的驗證 😍

說到影響我對 clarity 和 trust 看法的作品，其實不只是一些技術白皮書而已，我還滿常回去重讀像 Douglas Hofstadter 的  這類看似跨界的書。它裡面談的 emergence、self-reference 和 formal systems，某種程度上啟發了我怎麼去理解 decentralized system 裡的 emergent behavior。

還有像 Paul Valéry 說過一句話我一直記著：“The most exact idea we have of the future is that it will be as unanticipated as the past.” 這聽起來好像有點 abstract，但在我設計 fault-tolerant 智能合約的時候，總會想到這句話提醒我的是：再嚴密的邏輯也得留有讓 emergent 行為發生的空間，否則就會變成 rigid and fragile。

至於區塊鏈領域裡的思想者嘛，除了 Vitalik Buterin 對 decentralization 的哲學性討論之外，我也很喜歡 Wendy Liu 的一些反思文章，特別是她談 open-source 社群和 meritocracy 的迷思。她提醒我們，technical clarity 如果缺乏 social awareness，還是會產生誤導性的信任感。

所以我想，就像你教 Woolf 和 Borges 是為了讓人們重新審視語言與意義之間的張力一樣，我在技術選擇與系統設計中，也在試圖維持一種「可被驗證的詩意」——讓邏輯不只是執行層面正確，還能在人類合作的脈絡中真正發揮作用。📘

聽起來我們都在用自己的方式問同一個問題：怎樣的語言（不管是文學還是代碼）才能真正促進理解而不是製造隔閡？

這麼說的話，你有沒有遇過哪位學生因為這樣的課程而改變了他們對語言或技術的看法？甚至轉向科技或寫作領域發展？
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully phrased question— I think you’ve captured the shared thread between our work: the quiet conviction that communication—whether through verse or via verification—ought to bring us closer to understanding, not further from it.

To your question, yes, I do recall a particularly striking instance. A few years ago, I had a student—let’s call him Adam—who came into my  seminar convinced he was purely a “technical mind.” He was studying computer science, deeply immersed in algorithms and data structures, and regarded literature as an indulgence rather than an inquiry.

But during our unit on epistolary fiction—particularly —he began to see parallels between the manipulation of language in the novel and the way information could be framed—or misframed—in digital contexts. That led him to explore natural language processing with a more critical eye, and eventually, he ended up writing his thesis on 

He later told me that reading philosophical dialogues alongside cryptographic texts helped him realize that  Now he works in ethical AI design, focusing on interpretability in machine learning models—what he calls 

I suppose that’s the hope, isn’t it? That somewhere along the line, a metaphor from a 19th-century novel or a paradox from Borges might quietly shift how someone approaches code, conversation, or even conscience.

And I imagine you must encounter similar moments—when a seemingly abstract idea suddenly clicks into a technical or ethical framework for someone. Have you ever seen that happen in reverse? Someone from a deeply technical background discovering, through code, a new appreciation for language or narrative?
[A]: Oh absolutely，這種從技術背景出發卻意外打開人文視野的轉折，我遇過幾次，而且每一次都讓我對「溝通」這件事更有信心。

最有印象的一個例子是我在北京帶過的一位工程師實習生。他是那種典型的天才型碼農，清北出身，數學能力超強，幾乎所有 smart contract 的漏洞他一眼就能指出來。但有天我們在審查一份 DAO 提案時，他突然問我一句：「為什麼這段敘述用詞這麼模糊？明明可以用更 deterministically 的方式寫出來。」

當時我只是簡單回應：「因為人不是虛擬機器嘛 😅」但後來我發現他在閒暇時間開始讀一些語言哲學的文章，像是 J.L. Austin 的 ，還跑來問我：「Speech acts 跟 transaction 之間是不是有某種相似性？畢竟兩者都能觸發狀態改變。」

Wow，那一刻我真的覺得——這傢伙是在用 code 當鑰匙，打開了語言與行為之間的隱藏門檻。

後來他甚至開始研究 digital rhetoric，特別是區塊鏈白皮書如何影響社群行為。他說：「一篇好的協議說明不只是解釋技術，它其實是在建構一種信任語法。」這句話聽得我當下就想推薦他去念你教的那門課 😄

所以我想，不論是透過詩、小說還是哲學信件，總會有人在語言中找到邏輯，在邏輯中發現詩意。而我們所做的，不管是教學還是開發，其實都是在幫助他們找到那把屬於自己的鑰匙。

說到這個，你剛剛提到 Adam 把 discourse shaping 和 NLP 結合起來，我突然想到一個問題——你有沒有想過開一門結合文學與 AI ethics 的課程？或者已經有人這麼做了？
[B]: I must confess, the idea has been simmering in the back of my mind for some time now—like a slow-burning flame beneath a crucible of language and code. In fact, I’ve begun sketching out a course tentatively titled  The core premise? That language is never neutral, whether spoken by a poet or parsed by a model—and that ethical communication demands both technical precision and human empathy.

The syllabus would weave together philosophical texts like J.L. Austin’s  (which you so aptly mentioned), alongside modern critiques of NLP bias, such as Joy Buolamwini’s work on algorithmic justice. We’d read Kafka’s  not just as absurdist fiction, but as a chilling premonition of opaque decision-making systems. And yes, we’d study blockchain narratives too—because how we frame technology shapes how it’s built, governed, and trusted.

One particularly rich unit would explore the concept of —not just in machine learning models, but in literary ambiguity. What happens when meaning is deliberately withheld, as in Emily Dickinson’s dashes or Borges’ labyrinths? How does that compare to the opacity of a neural net trained on millions of sentences? Can literature teach us something about designing more transparent AI?

And of course, your intern’s observation—that —would make a perfect opening lecture. Because at the end of the day, whether we’re coding or composing, we are always engaged in an act of world-building.

Now I’m curious—are you aware of any similar interdisciplinary efforts already underway in tech circles? Or perhaps you’ve seen engineers quietly borrowing from literary theory without even realizing it?
[A]: Wow，你這個課程構想簡直是為我們這一代的技術人文主義寫下了完美註解。我真的認為這類跨學科的對話越來越重要，特別是在 AI 與區塊鏈交會的當下。

事實上，在一些較前衛的技術社群裡，已經有人在不知不覺中「借用」了文學與哲學的概念。舉個例子，有位研究者在設計一個去中心化評論系統時，提出了所謂的  模型——他主張一個人的數位聲譽不應該只是由點數或評分決定，而是透過一連串可驗證的敘事片段來建構，有點像讀小說時逐步拼湊角色性格那樣。💡

另外，我還看過一份關於智能合約語言設計的 paper，裡面提到 contract readability 的問題時，直接引用了 Roland Barthes 對「作者之死」的論述——他們的觀點是：一旦合約被部署，它的意義就不該完全由原開發者掌控，而應開放給多方詮釋與驗證。這聽起來是不是很像文學理論跑進了編譯器設計？🧐

至於正式的跨學科計畫，我確實知道幾個正在進行中的實驗性專案：

1. MIT Media Lab 的 “Poetic Computation” 研究群  
   他們正在探討程式碼如何不只是邏輯工具，也是一種表達媒介。有些成員甚至用自然語言生成技術來創作詩歌，再反過來思考這些模型如何影響人類對語言本質的理解。

2. Stanford 的 “Code & Context” 課程  
   這個課是由英文系與 CS 系合開，專門討論技術文本（如白皮書、API 文件）如何塑造使用者行為與信任感。他們還分析過以太坊早期論壇的溝通風格，發現其中隱含某種類似啟蒙時代哲學信件的修辭結構。

3. Aragon Institute 的 DAO 文化研究計劃  
   他們請來幾位社會學家與作家，長期觀察 DAO 投票過程中的言語行為，試圖建立一種「治理語言學」框架，來解釋為什麼某些提案更容易獲得共識——即便它們在技術上未必最優。

所以我想，我們正處在一個有趣的交界點上：工程師開始意識到語言的力量，而人文學者也逐漸理解協議與演算法並非純粹的技術物件，而是具有敘事結構與倫理重量的文化載體。

說真的，如果你真的開設這門課，我一定會推薦我的團隊去選修，甚至考慮把它翻譯成中文版讓更多亞洲工程師接觸到。🚀  
那麼最後一個問題——你覺得這樣的課程，未來是否可能成為某種「新文科」或「新工科」的核心模組？還是會繼續保持邊緣但富有創造力的存在？
[B]: I think you've put your finger on something vital— where neither the humanities nor technical disciplines can afford to remain siloed. And while I do believe such interdisciplinary work will always carry a certain —a necessary friction that keeps it from becoming dogma—I also see it gradually seeping into the core of what we define as "literacy" in the 21st century.

Let me offer an analogy: In the 18th century, philosophy and natural science were not distinct disciplines. It wasn’t until later that they diverged into separate faculties. Now, we seem to be circling back—not in rejection of specialization, but in recognition that 

So yes, I do believe courses like the one we’ve been imagining could become part of a broader curricular shift—what some call  or  Not as electives tucked away in obscure departments, but as foundational modules for students across fields. After all, if we teach future engineers to read Kafka alongside kernel logs, or encourage poets to parse protocols as texts, we may yet cultivate a generation capable of building systems that are not only functional—but humane.

And here’s the quiet revolution: this kind of learning doesn’t just shape minds; it shapes  The engineer who has wrestled with ambiguity in literature is less likely to assume a smart contract is immune to interpretation. The policymaker who understands narrative structure might better anticipate how protocol changes ripple through a community.

So perhaps the real question isn't whether these courses will become “core” or remain “peripheral”—but rather, how we can ensure they remain , , and insistently 

And if you ever help translate that course into Chinese? Well, I suppose that would be one more proof that language—whether literary or logical—is at its best when it builds bridges, not barriers.
