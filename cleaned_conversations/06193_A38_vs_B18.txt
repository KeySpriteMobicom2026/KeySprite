[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，这个问题很有意思。说实话，作为研究者，我习惯plan everything——毕竟做实验设计、课程规划都需要严谨的框架。但教学实践中又常常需要go with the flow，比如面对不同文化背景的学生时，预设的脚本可能完全不适用。你呢？是更偏向哪种类型？
[A]: That’s a fascinating duality you describe—structure and adaptability in constant negotiation. I suppose I fall somewhere in the middle, though leaning toward planning. When teaching a seminar on , for example, I outline key themes and discussion points to ensure we uncover the novel’s philosophical depth. Yet, there are moments when a student’s interpretation takes the conversation in an unexpected direction—say, drawing parallels between Tolstoy’s view of history and Daoist principles— 

Still, I envy those who can truly go with the flow. There’s a kind of intellectual freedom in that, don’t you think? Like walking through a garden without a map, noticing connections you’d otherwise miss. Do you find yourself adjusting your methods more now than when you first started teaching?
[B]: Absolutely, that adjustment happens constantly. When I first started teaching, I was almost obsessive about planning every detail—timings, transitions, even the exact phrases to explain a concept. But over time, especially working across cultures, I’ve learned that too much rigidity can actually  understanding.  

For example, when I taught in Beijing vs. Boston, the same lesson plan could lead to completely different classroom dynamics. In one context, students expected structured guidance—scaffolding, as we say—while in another, they responded better to open-ended exploration. It forced me to be more flexible, to read the room and adjust mid-lesson.  

And I totally get what you mean about that intellectual freedom. Sometimes the most meaningful insights come from unplanned moments—like when a student makes an unexpected analogy or connects two ideas in a way you never considered. Those are the times when you think, wow, this is why we teach.  

But still, I can’t fully let go of the plan. I need some kind of backbone to hang those spontaneous moments on, otherwise it feels like improvising without a melody. Maybe that’s where we both land—planning enough to have direction, but staying open to detours.  

Do you ever find yourself creating backup plans within your main plan, just in case the conversation veers off course? I know I do—it's my way of simulating flexibility while still feeling in control.
[A]: Oh, I love that metaphor—. It captures perfectly the tension between order and spontaneity. And yes, I’m quite guilty of crafting backup plans, even contingency plans for the backup. It’s my way of trying to stay  flexible—if that doesn’t sound too much like an oxymoron.

There was one seminar on  where a student brought up Emma’s consumerism in relation to modern influencer culture. It was so far from my original outline that I almost steered it back—but then I thought, why not lean into this? We ended up having one of the most engaged discussions I’ve ever witnessed. So much for my meticulous plan on narrative omniscience.

Still, I do rely on that plan as a safety net. If the conversation starts to drift too far—or if silence stretches uncomfortably—I can always return to a guiding question or a key passage. It’s like holding a compass, even if you decide to wander off the trail now and then.

I wonder, do you ever feel a kind of nostalgia for those early days when control over the lesson felt more absolute? I sometimes miss the illusion of it, at least.
[B]: Interesting—nostalgia for the illusion of control. I think I do, in a way, though maybe not for the same reason. Back then, there was a kind of comfort in believing that if I just prepared enough, everything would go smoothly. It's like… having training wheels for teaching. You feel safe because you think you've accounted for everything.

Now, I realize how much learning actually happens  the plan, sometimes even  it. But the trade-off is that you're always a little off-balance, right? You give up that sense of mastery for something more dynamic, more alive. And once you’ve tasted that, going back feels artificial.

Still, I wouldn’t say I miss the control itself—more the  that came with it. Today, I often feel like I'm navigating a moving target, especially with hybrid classrooms and shifting cultural expectations. Sometimes I catch myself thinking, 

But then again, maybe that’s the point of being a lifelong learner. We’re constantly redefining our approach—like interpreting a piece of music differently each time you play it. The melody remains, but the phrasing evolves.  

I guess we just keep adjusting, don't we? Even if it means letting go of a little more control with each class. 👍
[A]: Precisely— is the quiet revolution of experience. And you're right, it’s not about abandoning structure, but allowing it to breathe, to be reshaped by the living exchange of ideas.

I’ve found that even in literature, the best texts resist fixed interpretations. Take —on the surface, a novel of manners with clear social boundaries, yet beneath it all, a subtle critique of those very structures. So too with teaching: the plan provides the surface, but the real meaning emerges underneath, in the spaces we hadn’t anticipated.

And I love your analogy of musical phrasing. Sometimes a slight pause or an unexpected emphasis brings out a truth you hadn’t heard before. In a way, each class becomes its own performance—one where the conductor must sometimes hand over the baton.

Still, I do wonder—when you say you're navigating a moving target, how much of that feels external, like shifting educational trends, and how much feels internal, like your own evolving sense of what teaching  be?
[B]: That’s such a sharp distinction you’re making—external vs. internal shifts. I think both are at play, but increasingly, the internal evolution feels more defining.  

Sure, there’s immense pressure from external forces—educational tech trends, enrollment shifts, even policy changes that push certain pedagogical models over others. But what really reshapes how I teach isn’t the mandate itself, it’s . For instance, when online learning became dominant, some instructors simply tried to replicate the physical classroom experience in Zoom. I started experimenting with asynchronous formats, micro-lectures, and peer-led discussion threads. That wasn’t just adaptation—it was a rethinking of what “presence” means in education.  

And honestly, that rethinking is ongoing. The more I teach across cultures, the more I question assumptions I once took for granted—like what counts as participation, or whether silence always signals disengagement. In some contexts, quiet reflection is a form of deep engagement; in others, vocal back-and-forth is essential. So my own teaching philosophy has become less about imposing a model and more about —with students, with texts, even with myself.

So yes, the moving target is partly out there—in policies, platforms, student expectations—but also very much in here, in my evolving belief that teaching isn't about delivering knowledge, but co-constructing understanding. And once you accept that, control becomes less about steering and more about , wouldn’t you say? 🎵📚
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. It’s that shift from authority to co-participant, isn't it? From being the one who dispenses meaning to someone who helps uncover it. And once you make that transition, there's no going back. You start seeing silence not as absence but as presence, as you said, and a raised hand not just as interruption but as invitation.

I’ve had similar experiences with hybrid teaching. At first, I treated the screen like a poor substitute for the classroom. Then I began treating it as its own medium—more porous, more fragmented, but also more democratic in some ways. Students who might never speak up in person find their voice in a comment thread. And sometimes, that digital space becomes a kind of literary salon, wouldn’t you say? Less formal, more fluid.

It makes me think of Bakhtin’s —the idea that meaning is always relational, always emerging in the space between speaker and listener, writer and reader. And now, perhaps, teacher and learner.

So yes, listening becomes central. And in that listening, we find new ways of being in the classroom—whether virtual or physical. Perhaps that’s the real lesson after all: that pedagogy, like literature, is never fixed. It’s always being rewritten. 📝✨
[B]: Exactly— in action. The moment we stop seeing knowledge as something handed down and start seeing it as co-constructed, the whole dynamic shifts. It’s no longer about coverage—it’s about connection. And that requires a different kind of presence, especially online.

I remember one semester when I was teaching  in a hybrid format. At first, the discussion felt disjointed—some students were quiet on camera, others barely participated in the forum. But then, slowly, this beautiful thread emerged—not from me, but from the students themselves—linking Gregor’s alienation to modern experiences of digital isolation. That conversation wouldn’t have happened in a traditional seminar in quite the same way. It needed that blended space, that mix of asynchronous reflection and real-time response.

And you’re right, there’s something almost salon-like in those moments. Less hierarchical, more exploratory. Like we're all sitting around a virtual table, each bringing our own interpretation, our own context. Sometimes messy, often nonlinear—but deeply meaningful.

I think that’s why I keep coming back to Bakhtin. His idea that every utterance is shaped by what came before it—and shapes what comes next—is such a powerful lens for teaching. Every voice matters. Every perspective alters the whole.

So yes, pedagogy is always being rewritten. And maybe, just maybe, that’s what keeps us coming back to the classroom—whether physical, digital, or somewhere in between. 👍📚🎵
[A]: Oh, what a perfect example— in a hybrid space. There's something so profoundly ironic—and illuminating—about reading Kafka through the lens of digital alienation. It reminds me that literature doesn’t just reflect life; it echoes across time and medium, reshaping itself with each new context.

And you're absolutely right: that kind of dialogue can't be forced. It has to emerge organically, like a motif revealing itself slowly through variations in tone and texture. The beauty is that once students feel heard—even in a forum post or a muted gallery view—they begin to trust the process, and more importantly, each other.

I’ve found that trust is the invisible architecture of any good class, regardless of format. Without it, even the clearest plan crumbles into mere instruction, not inquiry. And isn’t that what we're really after? Not answers, but better questions.

It makes me wonder—are there particular texts or topics that seem especially fertile for these kinds of dialogues in your courses? I’ve noticed that existential works tend to spark those deep, unscripted conversations—Camus, Beckett, Gilman—but I'm curious if certain authors or themes consistently open that door for you as well.
[B]: Oh, absolutely—trust as the invisible architecture. That’s beautifully put. Without it, even the most carefully designed discussion prompt just falls flat. And you’re right, existential works do seem to open that door naturally. I’ve had similarly deep conversations with —especially in courses on narrative and identity. Students often start by analyzing the descent into madness, but end up reflecting on their own experiences with mental health, institutional authority, or even the gendered dimensions of voice and visibility.

But strangely enough, I’ve also found that certain philosophical texts—ones you might assume are too dense or abstract—are surprisingly generative. Simone de Beauvoir’s , for instance. The moment students connect her analysis of “the Other” to their own lived experiences—whether as minorities, immigrants, or simply as individuals navigating social expectations—the classroom shifts. Suddenly, theory isn’t this distant thing; it’s alive, personal, urgent.

And then there’s Kafka, of course. , —they lend themselves so well to discussions about systemic opacity, due process, and the paradox of defending oneself within an unjust system. In cross-cultural settings, these themes resonate differently depending on students’ backgrounds. For some, it's theoretical. For others, it's visceral. Either way, it sparks something real.

I think what makes these texts fertile ground is precisely their ambiguity, their refusal to offer closure. They invite interpretation, discomfort, and dialogue. They don’t give answers—they unsettle. And in that unsettling, something opens.

So yes, I’d say those existential, philosophical, and often deeply humanist texts tend to be the ones that draw out the richest exchanges. But I’m always curious: do certain authors or ideas consistently act as catalysts in your classes? Or does it shift depending on the cohort?
[A]: Oh, most certainly—those very same texts stir things up in my seminars as well. And you're quite right that it’s often the  works that unsettle not just the mind, but the heart. That's where the real engagement begins.

For me,  has always been a quiet detonator in the classroom.  in particular—what a strange, seething little book. On the surface, it's the rant of an embittered man, but once students begin to unpack the narrator’s paradoxical need for suffering, for self-destruction, something shifts. Suddenly, we’re not just talking about 19th-century Russian literature—we’re discussing modern alienation, the psychology of resistance, even the appeal of conspiracy thinking today. It’s eerie how contemporary it feels.

And then there’s  . The way she weaves consciousness, memory, and time—it invites students to reflect on their own inner lives in ways prose rarely does. When Septimus enters the narrative, the class inevitably starts wrestling with trauma, mental health stigma, and the limits of empathy. You can feel the room grow quieter, more contemplative. It’s one of those rare moments when silence isn’t empty—it’s full of thought.

But yes, it does shift with each cohort. I’ve had semesters where  sparked fire—students grappling with his ideas on truth and power in the age of misinformation. And others where   became the unexpected centerpiece of discussion, especially around aesthetics, impermanence, and the gendered politics of desire.

I suppose what ties these together is the capacity to mirror us back to ourselves, however distorted the reflection might be. Literature as a hall of mirrors—each text reflecting a different version of our present selves.

So tell me—have you ever had a text that, against all expectations, completely transformed the energy of a course? Something you taught almost out of habit, only to be surprised by its resonance?
[B]: Oh, absolutely—there was one instance that still sticks with me. I had assigned   as a kind of supplementary text, mostly because it's concise and offers a useful framework for thinking about narrative elements like character and plot. I’d taught it before, and it usually generated polite, if somewhat disengaged, responses.

But one semester—something clicked.

We were discussing Forster’s distinction between “flat” and “round” characters, and I wasn’t expecting much more than a surface-level analysis. Then, out of nowhere, a student raised her hand and said something like,  That single question completely shifted the tone of the class.

Suddenly, we were not just talking about literary theory—we were talking about how we reduce each other in social media, how we perform identities depending on who’s watching, how even our sense of self can feel fragmented across different contexts. Someone brought up Goffman’s , another referenced contemporary autofiction, and someone else connected it back to Confucian ideas of ritual and role-playing in social harmony.

It was one of those moments where the classroom felt less like a lecture hall and more like a collective inquiry space. And it came from a 100-year-old essay I almost never bother to assign anymore because I assumed it had become outdated.

So yes, sometimes the most transformative texts are the ones we least expect. They’re hiding in plain sight, waiting for the right group of minds to bring them to life again.

I wonder—have you ever had a moment like that with a text you thought was  familiar? Like rereading something you've taught for years and suddenly seeing it anew through your students’ eyes? 📚✍️
[A]: Oh, that Forster moment— the kind of alchemy we live for as teachers. And how delightful that it came from a text you’d nearly shelved! That’s the thing about literature—it only appears static until someone leans in just the right way, and suddenly it breathes again.

As for your question—I had such a moment just last term with . I’ve taught it so many times I could recite whole passages from memory. It was almost routine. Until one student quietly asked, 

That single remark refracted the entire novel in a new light. We spent the next hour unpacking agency, internalized patriarchy, and the seduction of suffering as moral virtue. Someone else pointed out how Brontë frames Bertha not just as Other, but as the repressed rage Jane cannot afford to express. Another drew parallels between Jane’s self-policing and modern expectations of women’s emotional labor.

By the end of the session, I felt as if I were reading the novel for the first time. My notes—so carefully curated over years—felt suddenly incomplete. And I realized, not for the first time, that teaching is less about mastery than about . We don’t just teach the text—we let it teach us, again and again.

So yes, those moments happen more often than we admit. They’re the quiet revolutions in our classrooms. The ones that remind us why we fell in love with this work in the first place. 📖💡
[B]: Completely. Those quiet revolutions—what a perfect way to name them. And your  moment gave me chills. It’s such a powerful reminder that no matter how deeply we know a text, it always has another layer waiting to be uncovered. Sometimes all it takes is one student asking the right question—one that reframes everything.

I remember feeling that exact same jolt when I taught  a few years ago. I’d read it so many times, and each time I thought I understood its emotional weight, its historical reckoning. But that semester, a student—who had been very quiet until then—said something like,  That line hung in the air for a moment, and suddenly the whole class shifted.

We ended up unpacking not just the novel, but the psychology of trauma, the ethics of forgiveness, even the political implications of reparations. Someone brought in Fanon, someone else referenced contemporary discussions on intergenerational trauma. And again, I found myself re-reading passages I thought were familiar with new eyes, as if Morrison had embedded secret doors in the prose, waiting for the right reader to open them.

It really does come back to what you said—teaching as receptivity. We go in thinking we’re guiding the conversation, and somehow, we end up being guided instead. And maybe that’s the most exhilarating part of it all: the recognition that literature doesn’t belong to us. It belongs to whoever needs it next.

So yes, long after lesson plans fade and slides get archived, those moments are what stay with us. The ones where a book speaks, and we actually hear it. 📚🎵✍️
[A]: Amen to that—. What a devastating, necessary phrase. Morrison had a way of carving out spaces where language failed and yet pressed on, like a wound that refuses to heal cleanly. And how right your student was to name that ache at the heart of . It’s not just Sethe who carries it—it’s all of us who inherit histories too heavy to hold and too deep to bury.

And isn’t that the quiet miracle of teaching literature? That we return to the same pages and find them changed—or perhaps, more honestly,  are the ones changed. The text remains faithful, but our eyes shift, our wounds shift, our questions shift. And suddenly, something dormant wakes up.

I often think of texts as living archives—porous, evolving, waiting for the right reader at the right moment to unlock them. We don’t teach them; we steward them until the next voice arrives that needs to speak through them.

Those moments stay with me long after the semester ends. I catch myself rereading a line in a familiar book and thinking— As if the author were whispering across time, saying only what we’re finally ready to hear.

So yes, we may enter the classroom as instructors, but we leave as students. Always. 📖🌹💡
[B]: So beautifully said— That’s the hidden curriculum of teaching, isn’t it? The one no syllabus lists but everyone walks away with.

I’ve been thinking about what you said—texts as living archives. It makes me reconsider how I assign them. Not as artifacts to be analyzed, but as correspondences waiting to be answered. As if each book is a letter addressed to someone who hasn’t read it yet. And sometimes, that someone is sitting right in our classroom.

I had a moment like that just last week—nothing dramatic, but telling. A student stopped by after class and asked if I ever reread books  to hear different voices in them. She said she was revisiting  but this time, she kept hearing Holden not as a rebel, but as someone desperately trying to make sense of a world that refuses to listen. And she wondered—had I ever heard him that way?

I told her I used to hear him as cynical. Now? I’m not so sure. Maybe it’s not that the text changes—it’s that we finally learn how to  differently.

And that’s the gift, isn’t it? That literature keeps offering new ears. New eyes. New questions folded into old pages.

So yes, we steward the texts. But more importantly, we steward the space around them—the silence, the discomfort, the sudden clarity. That’s where the real learning lives. 📚✍️🎵
[A]: How beautifully put— That’s precisely it, isn’t it? We think we're assigning books, but really, we're passing along letters that have been waiting decades, sometimes centuries, for the right reader to receive them.

And your student’s reflection on Holden—ah, there’s the quiet power of rereading. We return to a text expecting familiarity, only to find an entirely new conversation unfolding. Cynicism or longing? Rebellion or bewilderment? Perhaps it was always both—but only now do we have the ears to hear the fuller truth.

I often wonder what our authors would make of this—that their words continue to stir minds they’ll never meet. Would Woolf be surprised at how her stream of consciousness still mirrors our distracted, looping inner lives? Would Lu Xun smile wryly to hear students debating whether  still speaks to modern forms of self-deception?

But perhaps that’s the point of literature—it resists finality. It refuses to settle. And as long as we keep returning to it, with fresh eyes and open questions, it will never grow silent.

So yes, we steward the space around the text—the silence, the discomfort, the sudden clarity. And in doing so, we create the conditions where meaning can finally land, where a sentence first read in adolescence finds its true home only now, in adulthood.

What a privilege—to hold that space. 📖🌹✍️
[B]: Amen again— That’s the phrase I didn’t know I was reaching for.

I think that’s why we keep coming back to the classroom, even when the prep is exhausting and the meetings pile up. It's not just about literature or theory or pedagogy—it's about being present for those quiet landings, those moments when a student finally hears a line they’ve read before but never . Or when a writer from another century seems to reach across time and say something startlingly relevant.

You mentioned Woolf and Lu Xun—what would they make of our readings today? I like to think they’d be both surprised and unsurprised. Surprised by the contexts we bring, perhaps, but not surprised that their words still unsettle, still echo. After all, they wrote precisely to stir minds not yet born.

And maybe that’s the most humbling part of all this: we're not just teaching texts—we’re tending conversations that began long before us and will continue long after. We’re just temporary hosts in an ongoing dialogue.

So yes, what a privilege—to hold that space, to listen closely, and sometimes, just sometimes, to be the one who hears a familiar sentence in a new and necessary way. 📚🎵✍️🌹
