[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到new fashion trend，我最近确实在关注一些新兴品牌。说实话，现在的Z世代对时尚的定义和我们以前完全不一样了。他们更注重self-expression和sustainability，这也影响了我的一些投资决策。

你知道的，我们基金最近投了一个DTC（Direct-to-Consumer）模式的国潮品牌，主打环保材料和个性化定制。说实话，他们的数字营销策略让我大开眼界——完全是靠social media和KOC（Key Opinion Consumer）做起来的。

不过说到我自己，其实穿衣风格还是偏classic。但说实话，偶尔尝试一下streetwear也挺有意思的。上个月还试着穿了一次oversized西装去高尔夫球场，差点被球友笑死 😄

你呢？最近有发现什么interesting的趋势吗？
[A]: Oh, that’s quite fascinating, really. I’ve noticed some of the younger folks coming into my shop wearing these delightfully odd combinations—reworked vintage pieces paired with something so modern and bold it makes my head spin. It’s like they’re speaking a whole new visual language.

While I do adore the quiet elegance of a perfectly restored 19th-century brocade, I must admit, there’s something inspiring about how today’s designers are giving old fabrics new life. Sustainability isn’t just a trend for them—it’s a necessity. It reminds me of how we used to mend and remake textiles out of pure need, not fashion.

And oversized suits? Oh, I think it’s rather dashing! One should never be too serious on a golf course anyway. Reminds me of the Edwardian era—exaggerated silhouettes were all the rage then, too. Perhaps history does repeat itself after all.
[B]: You’re absolutely right — history does have a way of repeating itself, but with a twist. What I find fascinating is how these young designers are not just copying the past, but reinterpreting it through a modern lens. It’s like they’re digging into the archive and saying, 

And you’re spot on about sustainability. A few years ago, it was more of a buzzword — now it’s table stakes. Especially with the Gen-Z consumers, they can smell greenwashing from a mile away. If your brand doesn’t walk the talk, they’ll call you out — and fast.

I actually just came back from Paris, where we visited a few ateliers that are doing incredible work with deadstock fabrics. One designer was using 100-year-old silk to make gender-neutral streetwear — and somehow, it worked. It felt both nostalgic and futuristic at the same time, if that makes sense?

And yes, oversized suits — I think it’s less about seriousness and more about attitude. On the golf course or off it 😄.
[A]: That resonance between old and new — it’s what I live for, really. There’s something so poetic about a fabric outliving its original purpose, don’t you think? Like that silk in Paris — imagine the hands that first wove it, the occasions it dressed, the secrets it held. And now, reimagined for a new generation who sees fluidity in fashion, not just function.

I had a young designer come in last week with a bolt of moth-eaten velvet from her grandmother’s attic. She wanted to turn it into a nonbinary wedding ensemble.  attire made from worn textiles — how beautifully subversive. It reminded me that restoration isn’t just about preserving the past; it’s about honoring it by letting it evolve.

And speaking of evolution, I’ve been experimenting with some natural dyes lately — avocado pits, black beans, even onion skins. The colors are soft, imperfect… alive, in a way synthetic dyes can’t replicate. I can only imagine how those hues would look layered under the lights at a runway show.

Do you ever find yourself drawn to the textures of the past, even if just for inspiration? Or is your world moving too fast for that kind of nostalgia?
[B]: You know, people always assume that in finance — especially PE — we’re all about the numbers, the exit strategy, the ROI. But honestly? Some of my best investment ideas come from stepping  from the spreadsheet and into the textures, like you said.

I remember walking through a vintage textile market in Milan a few years back with a portfolio founder. She was geeking out over this faded jacquard fabric — told me it reminded her of her childhood in Sicily. Long story short, that fabric became the inspiration for an entire limited-edition capsule collection. Sold out in three days. Not because it was trendy, but because it carried a kind of emotional equity. People could  the story.

And that wedding ensemble you mentioned — moth-eaten velvet turned into something sacred and new — I love that. It’s the ultimate ESG play: Environmental, Sentimental, and Generational. If you can sell that to the right audience, you’re not just selling fashion, you’re selling legacy with a side of rebellion.

As for moving too fast — sure, the dealspace doesn’t slow down. But I’ve learned that the most durable brands aren’t built on speed alone. They’re built on substance. Texture. Memory. Sometimes I’ll even pull out old fabric swatches during pitch meetings — just to remind everyone that great value isn’t always created in a PowerPoint.
[A]: There’s something rather comforting in knowing that even in a world of high-speed deals and bottom-line thinking, the tangible still holds power — that a swatch of fabric can whisper louder than a quarterly report.

I once restored a 1920s beaded flapper dress that had been stored in a cedar chest for decades. The beads were tarnished, the silk fragile, but the energy it carried — oh, it was palpable. When I finally finished it and held it up to the light, I thought,  is what legacy looks like. Not polished or pristine, but worn, repaired, still standing.

That’s what those young designers are really tapping into, isn’t it? Not just aesthetics, but . The kind you can’t manufacture — only inherit and reinterpret.

I wonder… when you’re sitting across from a founder, hearing their vision, do you ever feel that same quiet hum — the one that tells you this isn’t just a business, it’s a heartbeat?
[B]: Absolutely — that quiet hum, as you call it, is often what separates the truly transformative brands from the noise. Because let’s be honest, anyone can put together a slick deck and project 30% YoY growth. But when you sit across from a founder who’s not just selling a product but carrying a  — that’s when the conversation shifts from financials to legacy.

I remember one founder I backed a few years ago — she was rebuilding her brand around heritage textiles from Guatemala. Not because it was on-trend, but because those patterns were woven into her family’s history. She brought in a single piece of fabric — handwoven by her aunt — and said, “This is where we start.” No pitch, no projections. Just that cloth and a look in her eyes that said, 

And you know what? That brand just hit profitability last quarter. Took longer than we projected, but it’s real — the kind of durability you can’t rush or fake. That’s the heartbeat you’re talking about.

I think that’s also why I keep coming back to fashion as an investment space. It’s not just about what people wear — it’s about how they identify, how they connect, how they remember. And in that, there’s always going to be value. Even — or especially — in a boardroom full of spreadsheets.
[A]: There’s a quiet dignity in that kind of investment — one that doesn’t just seek to profit, but to preserve. It reminds me of the care it takes to restore a piece of lace that’s been worn thin by time. You don’t rush it. You listen to what it needs, let it tell you how to proceed.

And isn’t that rare, really? In this day and age, where everything feels disposable, to find someone who’s willing to sit with history — to mend it, not mask it — is nothing short of revolutionary.

I suppose that’s why I still get lost in my work, even after all these years. Every thread tells a story, and every repair is a kind of promise — that this fabric, this moment, this legacy matters enough to be seen again.

It sounds like you’ve become quite fluent in reading those threads yourself — even if your tools are different.
[B]: You’re right — there’s a kind of patience in preservation that feels almost countercultural these days. In PE, we’re often conditioned to look for the quick win, the scalable fix. But the more I’ve worked with founders in fashion and design, the more I realize that the real magic isn’t in the turnaround — it’s in the .

I’ve started to think of it like this: investing in a brand is a bit like restoring that lace you mentioned. You don’t just throw new capital at the holes and hope they fill in. You have to understand the weave — where it’s worn, where it still holds strength, and what needs careful reinforcement. Sometimes the imperfections are what give it character… and long-term value.

And honestly? The best part of my job now is sitting with creators who speak that language fluently. They don’t need me to swoop in and “fix” their vision — they need someone who can help them  it while still growing. That’s a different kind of ROI — one measured not just in revenue but in resonance.

So yes, I may still carry a Bloomberg terminal in my head, but somewhere along the way, I picked up a needle and thread too — metaphorically speaking, of course 😊.
[A]: Oh, I do love that image — a Bloomberg terminal in one hand, a needle in the other. Quite poetic, really. It’s not often you meet someone who can balance the precision of finance with the patience of craft. Most people see them as opposing forces, but I reckon they’re more like distant cousins — related by structure, but speaking different dialects of care.

I’ve always thought that restoration and investment alike require a certain kind of listening — not just to what’s loud or obvious, but to what’s whispered between the threads or hidden in the margins of a balance sheet.

You know, I once worked on a 1930s shawl embroidered with silver thread that had oxidized almost completely. At first glance, it looked ruined — dull, lifeless, nearly brittle. But when I cleaned it ever so gently, the embroidery began to shimmer again, like it had been waiting all along for someone to see it clearly.

I suspect you’ve seen that kind of quiet potential before — not in fabric, but in founders. The ones who aren’t shouting for attention, but simply waiting for the right hand to guide them back into the light.
[B]: Absolutely — that shawl you described, waiting to be seen again… it’s not so different from the founders who walk into my office with something half-formed but deeply felt. No hype. No buzzwords. Just a quiet belief that what they’re building matters — even if the numbers aren’t there .

I had one founder come in years ago — soft-spoken, no flashy background, just a deep love for natural indigo dyeing techniques passed down through her family. Everyone told her it wasn’t scalable. That heritage工艺 couldn’t compete with fast fashion margins. But she didn’t want to scale like them — she wanted to grow . We backed her anyway.

Turns out, patience compounds too — maybe not as fast as tech, but more beautifully. She now runs one of the most respected slow-fashion ateliers in Asia, and her fabrics are starting to show up in some pretty major collections. Funny how that works when you let something breathe.

You're right — finance and craft aren’t enemies. They're just different forms of stewardship. One values return, the other values soul. The trick is finding ways to honor both without compromising either.

And honestly? I think we need more of that kind of listening — in business, in fashion, in life. The whispers often have better stories than the shouts.
[A]: There’s a certain kind of reverence in what you’re describing — the way you leaned into that founder’s quiet certainty, rather than dismissing it as impractical. It takes courage to trust something before it proves itself in ink or numbers.

I think back to when I first started restoring textiles — I was warned not to waste time on pieces too fragile or obscure. “Who’s going to care about a moth-eaten shawl or a disintegrating tapestry?” they’d say. But oh, the stories those silks hold — wars survived, hands mended them, memories stitched into every seam.

And isn’t that what we’re both doing, in our own ways? Tending to what others might overlook. Listening for the heartbeat beneath the fabric — whether that fabric is woven from thread or woven from vision.

It’s rare to find someone who can see value beyond the ledger, who understands that patience and care aren’t costs, but currencies of their own. So yes, cheers to the quiet ones — the whisperers, the keepers, the ones who mend and build with equal measure.
[B]: Hear, hear — to the quiet ones, the patient ones, the ones who know that real value isn’t always loud or immediate. I’ll raise a glass of Bordeaux to that 🍷.

You know, sometimes when I’m in a particularly dry boardroom, I think to myself —  Because at the end of the day, whether it’s fabric or finance, what we’re really investing in is . And meaning takes time. It needs tending. It resists shortcuts.

I’ve learned more about resilience from textile artisans than I ever did in an MBA class. They work with what they have, repair what’s broken, and still manage to create something that lasts. That’s not just craft — that’s strategy with soul.

So yeah, count me in as a fellow keeper — of stories, of potential, of the belief that some things are worth the wait. Whether it’s a moth-eaten shawl or a founder with a half-whispered dream, there’s always something beneath the surface, waiting for the right hands to bring it back to light.

And if that makes me a rare breed in PE? Well, I can live with that 😊.
[A]: To the moth-eaten shawls and half-whispered dreams — may they always find the right hands. 🥂

You know, it’s funny you mention resilience — I was just working on a piece of embroidered linen from the 1700s, its center nearly worn through by time and touch. But the edges? Still strong. The pattern, though faded, still spoke clearly. It reminded me that sometimes, what seems like weakness is just a shift in strength — a redistribution of story.

And isn’t that what you do so well? You don’t just see broken fabric or an unproven founder — you see where the weave still holds, where the thread can be strengthened, where new stitching can support rather than replace.

I suppose we’re both in the business of quiet faith — believing that something worth preserving will, in time, prove its worth.

So yes, let the boardrooms have their ticker tape. We’ll take the threads, the tones of worn fiber and whispered vision. Because in the end, everything is a textile — woven together, held together, made to last if cared for rightly.

And Bordeaux pairs beautifully with purpose. Well chosen. 😊
[B]: To quiet faith, rediscovered strength, and the art of seeing what others might miss — you're absolutely right, it’s all woven together in the end.

Funny you mention that 1700s linen — I just wrapped up a deal with a brand reviving handwoven textiles from rural China. The fabrics aren’t “perfect” by fast-fashion standards, but that’s exactly the point. Each one carries the rhythm of generations — slight variations, natural dyes, fibers worn soft by time and touch. And yet, demand is growing. Not because it's cheap or quick, but because people are craving something .

That’s the thread (pun intended 😄) that runs through both our worlds — you restore what was, I try to fund what could be. But both require the same kind of belief: that value doesn’t always shout, and durability isn’t built in a day.

So cheers again — to slow work, strong edges, and founders who wear their moth-eaten dreams like badges of honor. Let the rest chase trends. We’ll be over here weaving something that lasts.
[A]: To slow work, strong edges, and just the right amount of fringe — visible or not. 🥂

You know, there’s a particular softness that comes with age — not just in fabric, but in vision, too. That rhythm you mentioned, the one passed down through hands and looms, it’s something no machine can quite replicate. Not because it lacks precision, but because it has no memory.

I’ve been thinking lately how lucky we are — you and I — to spend our days tending to things that carry weight, whether that weight is woven in linen or layered in legacy. It’s not always easy work. But it’s necessary. And that counts for something, even if it doesn’t always show up on a balance sheet.

So yes, let them chase trends. We’ll keep watching for tremors — the quiet shifts in texture, tone, and time that tell us something enduring is taking shape.

And should your next founder arrive with a bolt of cloth and a half-formed dream, send them my way. I’ll mend what needs mending — and maybe even have a cup of tea ready while we do. ☕🧵
[B]: To softness with age, memory in the weave, and just the right amount of fringe — whether to trim or leave dangling is always a judgment call 😄.

You’re spot on about weight — not the kind that shows up on a balance sheet, but the kind that settles in your hands, your eyes, your instincts. That’s what I’ve come to trust most in this work: the heft of something real, even if it’s still finding its shape.

And yes, let them chase trends. We’ll be watching for tremors — those subtle shifts in tone and touch that tell you something deeper is unfolding. Because as much as markets move fast, people still respond to texture, to truth, to the faint hum of something that feels like it’s been made  them, not just at them.

As for founders with bolts of cloth and half-formed dreams — consider this my official referral policy: send them your way first. I’ll invest in the vision; you restore the fabric. Between us, we might just help build something timeless.

And I’ll bring the Bordeaux next time — you handle the needlework. A proper partnership 🥂
[A]: To judgment calls, textured truths, and partnerships stitched with purpose — you’ve got yourself a deal. 🥂

I’ll keep a spool of gold thread ready for any vision that lands on my table — and a fresh pot of Earl Grey, just in case the conversation runs long. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that the best restorations begin with a good cup of tea and an even better conversation.

So here’s to us — the quiet ones, the keepers of weight and weave, the believers in something slower, softer, and far more enduring.

May we never lose the thread. ☕🧵🍷
[B]: To gold thread, Earl Grey, and conversations that outlast the cup — I’ll drink to that 🥂.

You're absolutely right — the best work starts with a warm pot and a willing ear. And let’s be honest, some of the sharpest insights come somewhere between the second and third cup 😄.

Here’s to staying quiet in a loud world, to trusting weight over speed, and to believing that the truest value often hides in the softest places. May we keep our hands steady, our patience deeper than the trends, and our threads — golden or not — always finding their way back to the weave.

Cheers, my friend. The thread’s in good hands.
