[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得lab-grown meat会取代传统肉类吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, interesting question. It reminds me a bit of the cultural resistance to certain foods described in both Dickens' and Lu Xun's works - people cling to tradition not just for taste, but for deeply embedded social meanings. I suppose we'll need more than scientific arguments to shift such entrenched customs. Though I must admit, the idea of synthetic meat fascinates me from a literary symbolism perspective - it's like something straight out of Huxley's .
[A]: That’s a fascinating angle - the cultural symbolism definitely adds another layer to this discussion. From my perspective in private equity, I see lab-grown meat as more than just food tech; it's a ¥trillion market waiting to be reshaped%. 

You mentioned  - interestingly, the scalability of cultivated meat could make Huxley’s vision of "food production without livestock" financially & environmentally sustainable. But let’s not overlook consumer psychology. Much like how people initially resisted electric cars for their lack of engine sound, there’s an emotional gap to bridge with synthetic meat.

What do you think would be the most effective way to create cultural acceptance? In China, we’ve seen traditional medicine adapt to modern lifestyles by blending heritage with clinical validation. Could this industry follow a similar path?
[B]: I’d say you’ve put your finger on the pulse of both economic potential and cultural resistance. The emotional gap, as you called it, is precisely what literary studies might illuminate – take for instance how 19th-century British writers romanticized pastoral life in reaction to industrialization; we may be witnessing a similar nostalgia around “natural” food today.

In terms of cultural acceptance, yes – there’s wisdom in your comparison to traditional medicine. In fact, I’ve been rereading  lately, and it strikes me that the Monkey King’s transformations – changing his form while retaining his essence – offer an apt metaphor. If cultivated meat can preserve the sensory  symbolic essence of traditional meat while transforming its production, then perhaps societies East and West might accept it without feeling unmoored from tradition.

That said, I suspect the real hurdle lies not in clinical validation alone, but in narrative framing. We’ll need poets, advertisers, and yes, even professors like myself, to re-story this food into our collective imagination. After all, people don’t just eat with their mouths – they eat with their minds 🖋️.
[A]: I love that metaphor – the Monkey King’s transformation really captures the balance we’re trying to strike. It’s not just about being technically sound or ethically superior; it’s about  familiar while being fundamentally new. That duality is what makes great investments, too – you want innovation wrapped in a layer of comfort.

You mentioned narrative framing – I couldn’t agree more. In PE, we call it “storytelling with data.” The numbers have to make sense, but the story has to land emotionally. Imagine positioning cultivated meat not as a sci-fi experiment, but as a modern chapter in humanity’s age-old relationship with fire, feast, and fellowship. Even better if you can tie it to sustainability without sounding preachy.

And yes, we’ll definitely need poets & professors to help craft that narrative. Maybe even a documentary series or two 😊. Because at the end of the day, people invest emotionally before they do financially – whether it’s a brand, a company, or a new cut of lab-grown Wagyu.
[B]: I couldn’t have said it better myself – storytelling with data. Quite apt. And your point about emotional investment preceding financial commitment? That’s not just true in markets; it’s embedded in every literary tradition I teach. Whether it’s the  idealization of nature or the Confucian reverence for harmony, audiences respond when innovation speaks in the dialect of memory.

A documentary series is a brilliant idea – think of it as an epic with multiple narrators: scientists in crisp white coats, farmers with calloused hands, chefs wielding knives like calligraphy brushes. Each voice reinforcing the same central motif – continuity through change. If we pull that off, cultivated meat won’t feel like a rupture in our culinary heritage, but rather its natural evolution.

And speaking of evolution – imagine producing a short companion volume, almost like a , where terms like “cultivated,” “sustainability,” and even “meat” itself are redefined not by technocrats, but by poets and cultural historians. A bit like how Lin Yutang reinterpreted Chinese culture for Western readers in the 20th century. We might just create a new lexicon that tastes like progress without forgetting flavor.
[A]: I'm really liking this idea of a "glossary of the future" – it’s clever, and honestly, it fills a gap we often overlook in tech investments. Numbers tell us , but this kind of narrative defines the  that resonates across generations.

You know, when I look at cultivated meat, I don’t just see bioreactors and cell cultures – I see a brand waiting to be built, one that bridges centuries. Lin Yutang’s approach is a perfect reference; he made the familiar foreign feel intimate, and the foreign familiar. That’s exactly what we need here.

And let’s not stop at a companion volume – what if we go one step further and partner with culinary schools? Imagine a program where chefs are trained not just in technique, but in storytelling through taste. A Michelin-starred plate of lab-grown beef shouldn’t just impress the palate; it should whisper stories of innovation, sustainability, and cultural continuity with every bite.

We’d be doing more than selling a product – we’d be crafting a legacy. And frankly, that kind of vision is what makes me excited to pick up the phone and start making calls tomorrow 👍.
[B]: Now you’re thinking like a cultural architect, not just an investor – a rare and powerful combination. Partnering with culinary schools? Inspired. After all, what is cuisine if not condensed history on a plate? And what is cultivated meat if not a new chapter in that ongoing feast?

I’d take it one step further – why not commission a series of essays alongside the program? Each dish could have its own literary counterpart: a short story, a poem, even a haiku that echoes its ethos. Imagine serving lab-grown Peking duck with a side of contemporary poetry that riffs on the ancient qin’s melancholy – nostalgia for a future we’re only beginning to taste.

And don’t underestimate the symbolic power of that first bite. Much like the ritual of pouring tea or breaking bread, it could become a quiet act of faith in progress. You’re not just crafting a legacy; you’re creating a sacrament of the future 🖋️👍. I’d say that’s worth picking up the phone for – and then some.
[A]: You’re absolutely right – this isn’t just about food or even tech; it’s about ritual, memory, and meaning. I hadn’t thought of it as a “sacrament of the future,” but now that you’ve said it, it makes perfect sense. Every culture has its sacred meals – why not make one of them a cultivated steak?

I love the idea of pairing each dish with literary work. It adds depth, context, and soul to what might otherwise feel like just another alt-protein play. We could even create a rotating menu tied to seasonal themes, each with its own curated anthology. Spring launch? A series of haikus celebrating renewal. Winter? Something darker, maybe a Murakami-esque short story served alongside a rich, slow-cooked lab-grown beef stew.

This kind of layered experience would do more than impress critics – it would  them. Because at the end of the day, people may forget the ROI, but they’ll remember how that first bite made them feel 🥩📚.

Let me reach out to a few contacts in F&B and publishing. If we move fast, we could pilot this concept in Shanghai by fall – what do you say?
[B]: I say: let the feast be planned. Shanghai would be the perfect stage – a city where tradition and futurism waltz daily beneath the same skyline. Just imagine the launch – dim sum by day, cultivated meat tasting menus by night, all threaded with ink-brushed poetry on the walls and in the menus.

And why stop at seasonal themes? We could build narrative arcs across months – a month of ghost stories and umami-rich broths in autumn, a springtime ode to rebirth with lighter, crisper pairings. Hell, we might even commission a modern -style narrative that places cultivated meat at the heart of a contemporary Chinese epic.

You handle the investors and kitchens; I’ll draft the curatorial framework and reach out to a few poet-friends who owe me favors 🖋️. If we time this right, by the time winter rolls around, people won’t just be talking about what they ate – they’ll be quoting the menu.
[A]: Now  is a vision worth funding 👏. A modern  with cultivated meat at its heart? Brilliant – you give this industry the soul it needs to endure.

Shanghai in autumn it is, then. I’ll start lining up the key players – a forward-thinking restaurant group, a few bold investors who appreciate narrative-driven value creation, and maybe even a tech partner to help us build an AR experience where diners can "see" the story behind each bite. Imagine scanning a QR code on the menu and watching a ghost story unfold on your phone, all while sipping a lab-grown broth that was crafted to echo its flavor notes 🍲📱.

And don’t forget – menus quoting poetry, walls inked with future myths. We’re not just launching a product; we’re hosting a cultural séance, summoning the next chapter of food heritage.

I’ll make some calls tomorrow morning. Let’s get those favors called in – and the future plated.
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language – a cultural séance, indeed. I do love that phrase. And the AR element? A stroke of modern alchemy – merging the tangible and the textual in real time. It’s like something out of a Lu Xun story, only with better optics 🖋️.

I’ll start drafting the curatorial outline this weekend – expect a flurry of late-night emails bearing titles like  And do keep me posted on your investor conversations. If we can get one or two with a taste for the humanities, we may just pull off a quiet revolution.

And yes – let’s plate the future. Carefully, beautifully, and with just the right hint of mystery. I do believe we’ve stumbled onto something here – not just an event, but a movement. Now, where’s my teacup? I feel a long night of ink and inspiration coming on.
[A]: I’ll take "quiet revolution" and raise you a "symphony of ink and innovation" 😄. There’s something deeply poetic about using cutting-edge tech to bring literary ghosts to life on the dinner plate – and even more thrilling about doing it in a city like Shanghai, where every street corner hums with past and future alike.

I’m already drafting the investor teaser – think of it as a prospectus with soul. We’ll position this not as a food trend, but as a , backed by science and seasoned with story. I’ll make sure to quote Lu Xun somewhere early on – nothing gets a thoughtful investor leaning in like a well-placed line from literary history 🖋️.

And don’t worry about the teacup – I’ll send over a virtual refill. You keep the ink flowing; I’ll handle the capital. Together, we might just redefine what it means to break bread in the 21st century.

期待我们的革命 (Looking forward to our revolution).
[B]: “Symphony of ink and innovation” indeed – you’re learning the dialect of cultural alchemy far quicker than most investors I’ve met. And yes, let’s raise our glasses – or teacups, as the case may be – to .

I’ll draft a companion essay for your teaser – something titled, perhaps, . Consider it a kind of literary garnish for your pitch. A dash of Confucius here, a whisper of Woolf there – just enough to intrigue without overpowering the main course.

And do keep me posted on the investor responses. If they balk at the poetry, remind them gently that every great movement – from the Tang poets to the Bauhaus – was once a quiet conversation over tea. Or in our case, a very deliberate pairing of lab-grown lamb and Li Bai.

期待与你共饮这杯未来 🖋️🍵.
[A]: 敬这杯未来，更敬你这位 co-conspirator in culture & capital 🍵🖋️. 你这句话————值得裱起来挂在展厅入口。我甚至已经在想，要不要真做个限量版“lab-grown lamb paired with Li Bai”菜单，配上几句《将进酒》烫金印在黑卡纸上，让投资人一边吃一边念诗，情绪上来了，笔也就不抖了。

你的 essay 标题太妙了，《The Table as Text》——完美地概括了我们正在做的：把一顿饭变成一段可食的叙事，把 every bite into a footnote of the future. 我会在 pitch deck 里留一页空白，等你的文字来点睛。Confucius 和 Woolf 同桌吃饭？这种跨界我绝对买单。

投资者那边我已经开始试探，目前反馈比预期温和。有位朋友开玩笑说 we’re selling “meat with a master’s degree.” 😂 我回应说 no, we’re selling meat that . 

保持联系，老友。下一轮脑暴我请茶 – real one, not virtual. 革命虽静，但总得有点烟火气才够味。
[B]: 敬你这位策动味蕾与文脉的共谋者 🍵🖋️——“meat that writes back”这个说法简直妙极，我得记下来，怕你哪天反悔收回去。我们这不是在筹资，是在招魂，在给未来签注一封带肉香的回函。

至于那张黑卡烫金《将进酒》，我倒觉得可以再加点戏：菜单背面印几句 Woolf 的《厨房笔记》片段，或是某段重写版的《论语》注疏，让东西方的经典在餐桌上短兵相接、杯盏交错。思想越锋利，下筷越果决嘛 😂。

你留的那页空白就交给我吧，我会写一篇不叫人犯困的《Table as Text》摘要——毕竟没人想边吃 lab-grown lamb 边听教授讲理论 😴。但若能在口中尝出历史的层次，在舌尖读出未来的章节……那投资人签下的就不只是支票，是一页文化契约。

“烟火气才够味”说得太对了。革命要慢炖，故事要细嚼。等你请茶，老友。咱们得先养足精神，好端起这整座未来的桌席。
[A]: 哈哈哈，加戏加得好——思想越锋利，下筷越果决 😂。我正愁这场pitch少了点火花，现在好了，我们不只请他们吃饭，我们是在策一场“哲学与肉的对位法”晚宴。让孔子和Woolf隔着餐桌对望，投资人想走神都难。

你那页《Table as Text》摘要我可是翘首以待——得像一首精炼的俳句，又像一句精准的 trade thesis：让人在吞咽之间，读懂历史与未来的咬合处 🍽️🖋️。

至于那页空白，我已经把它命名为“灵魂佐料区”——由你掌勺，我放心。等签完那页文化契约，我们再来补一杯，敬那些还没写出来的菜单、还没尝过的未来，和还没命名的投资新范式。

烟火气我已备好，就等你来添味。老友，快些动笔吧——未来这桌席，可不能冷了。
[B]: 哲学与肉的对位法——你这策展思路越来越像一场流动的学术盛宴了，我简直想提前打印请柬，写上“今夜特邀：康德与火锅共饮，海德格尔与分子料理同席” 😂。

至于那页“灵魂佐料区”，我定不负所托——只求字字如骨中带肉，理论里藏香。不为灌输，只为点醒：让每一口吃下去的人都能嚼出一点被灯光照亮的旧书页，和一丝尚未封坛的新酒气。

投资新范式也好，文化契约也罢——说到底，我们不过是在用未来做汤底，把东边的老火候、西边的新配方，一道道煨进这场晚宴里。等它沸腾时，谁还分得清哪勺是资本，哪勺是文明？

茶已泡开，笔正待落。老友，且等我三日——三日后携文赴约，共添这一炉烟火中的未来之味 🖋️🍵🍽️。
[A]: 哈哈哈，就等你这句话—— 👏👏。你这比喻绝了，简直比米其林主厨的sauce reduction还浓缩、还提鲜。

康德与火锅共饮？海德格尔与分子料理同席？😂 我已经开始想投资人一边读《存在与时间》，一边用筷子戳一块lab-grown beef的画面了。这不是pitch，是文化降维打击 😂🍽️。

三日之约我等定了，《灵魂佐料区》必须配上你那支带香的笔。等你携文赴宴那天，我一定备好一壶老普洱，边喝边把整个商业模型再翻炒一遍，确保资本与文明在同一个锅里翻滚出味。

烟火中的未来之味——说得多好。我们不是在写计划书，是在煨一篇可吃的论文 📝🥩。

茶已热，纸已展，等你落笔如点火——  
这一炉，烧的是思想，炖的是远见。
[B]: 好一个“煨一篇可吃的论文”——你这说法简直让理论都泛起了焦糖香气 😂。不过说正经的，我倒真觉得学术界该向厨房多学点东西：火候、调味、还有那恰到好处的 Maillard reaction，远比多数论文摘要来得真切动人。

至于康德与火锅——别笑得太早，等我们的菜单真配上《纯粹理性批判》精选摘录时，你就知道投资人该练练筷子与思辨的同步协调了 🥢💭。或许我们该加个餐后甜点环节，用一碗桂花味的 postmodernism 来收尾？

三日后见，老友。我会带着墨香与一点轻微的灼伤感而来——毕竟，思想这炉火，烫手得很。但愿你的普洱够浓，能让我们在翻炒资本与文明时，还能稳住那一口舌尖上的平衡 🖋️🔥🍵。
