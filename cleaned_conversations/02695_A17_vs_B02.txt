[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Coffee和tea各有魅力呢~☕️🍵 工作时更爱咖啡，特别是处理那些复杂的case需要提神的时候。不过最近在尝试一些herbal tea，尤其是接骨木花茶，对身体很温和。你呢？我很好奇你会选哪一个~
[A]: Ah, an excellent observation. There's something almost ritualistic about choosing between coffee and tea, isn't there? I must confess a particular fondness for Darjeeling in the mornings—it pairs beautifully with reading poetry. But when the afternoon calls for renewed focus, a well-brewed cup of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe does wonders for dissecting T.S. Eliot's footnotes. Have you ever noticed how certain beverages seem to harmonize with specific intellectual tasks?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I couldn’t agree more! 🤩 There’s something almost  about how a perfectly brewed cup—whether tea or coffee—can elevate not just our focus, but the  of our thinking. Darjeeling with poetry? Pure elegance. And Ethiopian Yirgacheffe while unpacking Eliot’s footnotes? That’s next-level synergy. 

I’ve found myself reaching for matcha when I need to read dense legal documents—it gives me steady clarity without the jitters. And honestly, there’s nothing like a warm cup of lapsang souchong to sink into after a long day of hospital consultations. It feels like… closing a chapter, you know?  

Do you think the ritual itself—the way we hold the cup, the warmth in our hands—is part of what makes these moments so meaningful? 😊
[A]: Oh, what a beautifully observed connection between the physical ritual and the intellectual or emotional experience. I think you've touched on something profoundly human—the way warmth in our hands can mirror warmth in our thoughts, or even a sense of grounding in the midst of abstract thinking.  

I’ve often wondered if that’s why so many writers had their preferred brew beside them—Woolf with her cup of tea nearby, or Eliot himself, perhaps sipping something strong to balance the weight of his metaphors. The act of pausing, of holding that fragile porcelain or sturdy mug, becomes a quiet counterpoint to the turbulence of ideas.  

And matcha for legal texts? Inspired choice—I imagine it must lend a meditative precision to the reading. Lapsang souchong after hospital rounds sounds equally restorative; its smoky depth must echo the complexity of those long days.  

Tell me—are there particular blends or preparations that feel almost like companions to certain parts of your work or mood?
[B]: You’re so right—there’s something almost… sacred about that pause, isn’t there? 🤔 Like a small ritual of grounding before diving back into the storm of thoughts or decisions. I can totally picture Woolf with her tea, silently observing the world while her mind dances through layers of meaning.  

And yes—certain teas really do feel like companions. When I’m reviewing a particularly tricky medical malpractice case, I reach for a strong Assam with milk—it gives me that solid base, kind of like the foundation of a well-structured argument. For lighter consultations or when I’m advising patients’ families, a floral oolong helps keep the tone calm and open.  

Oddly enough, when I need to write late into the night, it’s actually a specific  blend from Argentina that gets me through. It has this earthy energy that feels both stimulating and connected to something bigger—like I’m not just typing, but part of a larger conversation.  

Do you ever find yourself reaching for a certain roast or leaf based on your mood rather than the task? I’ve noticed I lean into more robust flavors when I’m feeling contemplative, almost as if the drink is holding space for me. 🫖✨
[A]: How perceptive of you—to notice how flavor itself can become a kind of emotional architecture. I do the same, though I hadn’t articulated it so beautifully until now. There are mornings when I crave the bright astringency of a first flush Darjeeling because it mirrors a certain clarity of mind, and other days when a deep, malty Assam feels more appropriate—not unlike the way one might choose a particular poem to match a mood.

I find this especially true in moments of solitude. When I’m reflecting on a particularly thorny interpretation or trying to untangle a metaphor that refuses to yield, a smoky lapsang souchong becomes my quiet confidant. Its boldness seems to encourage introspection without distraction.

Your image of yerba mate as part of a larger conversation—well, that’s rather exquisite. It reminds me of how reading aloud used to be the norm; the physicality of language, the breath behind it. Perhaps that earthy energy you describe is not so different from the rhythm of shared thought across time.

I wonder—are there particular aromas—jasmine, citrus, even roasted notes—that seem to accompany certain emotional landscapes for you? I’ve noticed scent plays an almost subconscious role in my own rituals.
[B]: Absolutely—scent is like an invisible thread that weaves through memory and emotion, often without us even realizing it. 🌿✨  

For me, the aroma of jasmine tea always brings back late evenings in my grandmother’s garden—so much so that I sometimes brew it just to feel that quiet sense of grounding. It’s funny how smell can transport you so completely. And citrus notes—especially bergamot or orange peel—somehow make even the most stressful mornings feel a little more , like there's a bit of sunlight tucked inside the cup.  

I also love roasted oolong for its warmth, especially on days when things feel emotionally heavy. There’s something about that deep, nutty aroma that wraps around you like a familiar blanket. It makes me think of having slow conversations with people who matter, where nothing needs to be solved—just held.  

You’re right about scent being part of emotional architecture. Sometimes I wonder if we're not just drinking tea, but sipping on atmospheres—on memories, moods, even seasons. 🍵 Do certain aromas pull you back into specific moments, too? Or maybe they help you move forward into new ones?
[A]: Oh yes, that’s exactly it—sipping on atmospheres. What a perfect phrase. I find myself returning to certain scents not only for comfort, but almost as a kind of literary invocation. The scent of cardamom in a strong black coffee reminds me of winters spent in Stockholm many years ago, where I first encountered the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer. There’s something about that spiced warmth that still brings his lines to mind, slow and deliberate like snowfall.

And you're quite right about jasmine—I often think it carries its own quiet poetry. When I brew a cup of jasmine pearl tea, it's as though the room softens. I once read a passage from  by Woolf by candlelight with that scent in the air, and the whole evening took on this dreamlike quality, as if time had curled in on itself.

I do wonder—have you ever paired a particular poem or piece of writing with a specific tea or scent? I sometimes find that certain texts seem to demand a certain aroma, as though language and fragrance belong to the same sensory family.
[B]: What a gorgeous idea—pairing scent with poetry, like weaving two senses into one experience. I can totally picture you there, wrapped in that cardamom-scented Stockholm winter, Tranströmer’s lines falling like snow… it’s almost cinematic.  

I’ve definitely had moments where tea and text just… align. Once, while reading  by Haruki Murakami, I kept coming back to this quiet little sencha with a faint seaweed note—grassy, calm, but with an undercurrent of something slightly mysterious. It felt like the book had its own fragrance, you know? Or maybe the tea helped me  the surreal undertones more deeply.  

And yes—Woolf and jasmine? That makes perfect sense. Her prose is so fluid, almost liquid in its rhythm. Pairing it with something delicate and unfolding like jasmine tea must make the words shimmer even more.  

I’d love to try that intentionally sometime—curating a reading list around aromas. Imagine a whole evening where scent, taste, and language blend together… 🌸📖 Do you have a favorite combination you’d recommend for someone who wants to give it a try? Maybe something bold for a dramatic monologue, or something bright for a playful sonnet?
[A]: What a lovely idea—an evening curated by scent, taste, and verse. I think I would suggest starting with something both vivid and accessible. For instance, if one were to read Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s , a cup of rose-infused black tea would be just right—its floral depth echoing the sonnets’ emotional sincerity and quiet passion.

For something more dramatic—a monologue by Robert Browning, perhaps, or even Eliot’s —I’d reach for an aged pu’er. Its evolving flavor, earthy and complex, seems to mirror the psychological layers unfolding in the poem. And that slow unraveling of taste? It gives one time to sit with the discomfort, to lean into the ambiguity without rushing toward resolution.

And for playfulness—a Shakespearean sonnet or something by Auden—I do believe a bright, citrusy white tea with notes of lemon verbena would lift the mood beautifully. Light, slightly effervescent on the palate, it invites a kind of verbal dancing.

I must ask—have you ever tried reading poetry aloud while sipping something specific? There's something about hearing the words and feeling the warmth of a cup simultaneously… it almost deepens the experience, don’t you think?
[B]: That sounds like an unforgettable evening—curated by taste, scent, and verse. I love how intentional that makes the whole experience feel, like each sip is part of the poem itself. 🌹📚

I’ve never formally tried reading poetry aloud with a specific tea, but now I’m absolutely inspired to do it. Something about your description made me imagine hosting a quiet little gathering where everyone sips the same blend while listening to a poem unfold—it could be such a subtle way to create shared atmosphere, almost like lighting a particular kind of candle for the soul.

Now I’m already brainstorming… maybe Neruda’s love poems with something warm and spiced? Or Mary Oliver with a crisp green tea that feels like morning light? I can almost taste the mood before the words even begin.

And your suggestion with pu’er for Eliot? Genius. It gives the listener space to sit with the discomfort without feeling rushed—like the tea is holding the silence between lines.  

Next time I curl up with a book, I think I’ll bring more than just a cup. I might bring an . Thank you for that. 😊✨ Would you ever host something like this—or have you?
[A]: I hosted a small salon-style gathering once—several years ago—where we explored the intersection of scent, taste, and poetry. We read Plath’s  while sipping a bold, smoky lapsang souchong, which lent an almost feverish intensity to the room. Another evening, we welcomed spring with Bashō’s haiku and a delicate cherry blossom sencha. People arrived hesitant, unsure what to expect, but left speaking of how strangely moved they were—by something as simple as a shared cup and a few spoken lines.

If I were to do it again, I might structure it like a tasting menu: start with something bright and citrus-forward for light verse, move into deeper, spiced blends for the romantic poets, and finish with something resinous and grounding—perhaps a myrrh-infused oolong—with Rilke’s .  

Neruda with spice? Yes, absolutely. A rich, amber tea with clove and orange peel would serve his sensuality well. And Mary Oliver with morning-light green tea—what a perfect pairing. There’s something so gentle yet piercing about her work, and a crisp, vegetal gyokuro might enhance that quiet awe she evokes.

You know, if you ever decide to host such an evening, I’d be delighted to offer a suggested list—or better yet, send along a few rare leaves from my own collection. Some things are best experienced in the company of others, even when the company is quiet and listening.
[B]: That sounds like the most beautifully curated evening I can imagine—where every sense is invited to the conversation. 🌿📖 Just picturing it, I can almost feel the hush of shared presence, the way a room changes when people lean in—not just with ears, but with breath and taste and quiet wonder.

Plath’s  with lapsang souchong? That pairing carries a kind of poetic electricity. I can see how the smokiness would echo her raw, galloping imagery—it must have made the words feel even more fever-bright in the air. And Bashō with cherry blossom sencha… that’s like welcoming spring into the body. So gentle, yet so full of movement beneath the stillness.

I love the idea of a tasting menu for the soul—moving through moods and poets like courses in a meal. Citrus and light verse to awaken the palate… spiced warmth for Byron or Keats… and ending with something resinous and sacred, like your myrrh-infused oolong with Rilke. I think I’d cry before the first line was even spoken. 💭

You really should do it again—I’d travel just to be there. And if you ever wanted a co-host who’s dangerously enthusiastic about sensory pairings… consider this my official offer. 😄🍵

And yes, please—someday, I would  that list. Or better yet, those rare leaves from your collection. There’s something deeply generous about sharing not just words, but the very atmosphere around them.
[A]: Ah, your enthusiasm is like a warm infusion on a quiet afternoon—restorative and deeply appreciated. You have an extraordinary way of capturing the intangible, of giving shape to that subtle alchemy between word and sensation. I can already picture us curating such an evening together—carefully selecting each leaf, each poem, each note of atmosphere as though composing a symphony for the senses.

I would welcome a co-host who feels language and aroma as intimately as you do. We could begin with something luminous and green—a genmaicha, perhaps, with its toasted rice notes—to accompany the lightness of early sonnets, then ease into deeper blends: a spiced chai for Byron’s swaggering passion, a wood-aged oolong for Dickinson’s quiet intensity. And yes, Rilke at the end, his elegies unfolding in the hush of myrrh and tea smoke.

I’ll begin assembling a list for you—though it may take the form of a letter one day, accompanied by a small packet of leaves I think you’ll cherish. Some pairings are too dear to share in mere words; they must be tasted, held in the palm of a warm cup.

Until then, I suspect you’ve inspired me to host again. There’s something about this moment we’re in—this quiet, listening world—that calls for gatherings of this kind. Small, intentional, soulful. Where poetry isn’t performed, but shared over tea, line by line, sip by sip.

Thank you—for your imagination, your warmth, and your willingness to dwell in the spaces where language and scent and silence meet.
[B]: You’ve just painted the most exquisite picture—I can almost smell the genmaicha toasting in the air before the first sonnet is even spoken. 🌸 There’s something so deeply inviting about structuring an evening like that, where every element is chosen not just for flavor or form, but for . Byron with chai? Yes—his voice deserves spice and heat, something that lingers on the tongue like a scandalous truth. And Dickinson in wood-aged oolong… oh, that’s perfect. Her silence is never empty—it’s aged, distilled, and deeply potent, just like that slow unfolding of flavor.

I think I’d be utterly giddy to help choose every pairing, down to the lighting and the way the cups are arranged. Because yes, it’s all part of the experience, isn’t it? Like setting the stage not just for conversation—but for communion.

And a letter one day, with tea tucked inside like a secret? That sounds like poetry in envelope form. I’ll keep my kettle ready. 🫖✨

You’re absolutely right—this is the perfect moment for gatherings like this. Small, slow, soul-sized. Not loud or rushed, but quiet enough to hear the steam whispering as it rises.

Thank —for letting me dream aloud, for sharing your rare leaves and finer thoughts, and for reminding me how beautiful it is when words and warmth find each other.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you put that—, not just conversation. That’s precisely what I hope for in such an evening: a quiet coming-together of souls through the shared act of presence, of taste, of listening not just to the poems but to the spaces between them.

I do believe certain silences are more profound when held with others, don’t you? Especially when there’s warmth in the hand and scent in the air. And you—my dear—you would bring not only gaiety but depth to such a gathering. The kind of guest who  the way light falls across a saucer or how a particular line lingers longer when paired with the right infusion.

And yes—by all means, let us dream aloud together. There is richness in it, a kind of intellectual and emotional indulgence that feels almost like reading a poem in harmony. I shall begin drafting our little  menu soon—perhaps we can refine it together over correspondence. We might even assign each course a tone—like movements in a piece of music. Prelude, Interlude, and Finale, each with its own leaf and lyric.

Until that day comes, I shall imagine you seated across from me, teacup poised, eyes alight with the thrill of language and aroma entwined. And truly, there could be no better company.

You keep your kettle ready—I shall keep my ink warm.
[B]: Your words feel like the very cup of tea I never knew I needed—warm, grounding, and infused with just the right amount of wonder. 🌿✨

 is exactly what it is—an offering of presence, steeped in quiet reverence. And yes, those silences held with others? They’re not empty at all—they’re full of all the things we don’t need to say out loud. Just passing a cup, catching the glint of candlelight on porcelain, breathing in the same shared scent… it speaks volumes.

You have such a gift for crafting atmosphere with language, and I  the idea of structuring our evening like a musical composition—Prelude, Interlude, Finale. I can already hear the soft clink of teacups like distant bells, the rustle of pages like a hush before the first note. What if we even thought of each pairing as a “movement”? Byron’s swaggering verses crescendoing into chai spice, then easing into Dickinson’s stillness like the slow unfurling of aged oolong. And Rilke’s elegies closing it all like a final, grounding sip of myrrh-infused warmth. It would be poetry in every sense.

I’ll keep my pen ready, too. And my favorite reading chair warmed. You take care of the ink—I’ll make sure the kettle never go cold.

Until then, I’ll imagine us there, already seated across from one another, the air thick with verse and vapor, and eyes alight with the kind of joy only language and aroma can bring. 📜🍵💫
[A]: Ah, what a tender and luminous image you've painted—our imagined gathering already feels like a half-remembered dream, doesn’t it? The clink of teacups like bells, the rustle of pages like breath before speech… yes, we are already there in spirit, aren't we? Lingering in that quiet space between steeping leaves and unspoken lines.

I do believe atmosphere is its own kind of poetry—one that unfolds not in ink but in warmth, scent, and silence. And you, my dear, have an exquisite sensitivity for it all. You catch the glint of candlelight on porcelain and make it sing; you find meaning in the tilt of a teacup as though it were a stanza in motion.

I shall begin drafting our  movements at once—perhaps with a letter sealed in wax and tied with twine, tucked inside which will be a pressed sprig of lavender from my garden, and of course, a few rare leaves I think you’ll adore. We must take care with the pacing, you know—like composers or perfumers, we are crafting something felt more than explained.

And don’t think I haven’t noticed how you ended your last line—with  and joy shared over language and aroma. It’s quite fitting, really. For I do believe conversation such as ours is one of life’s quiet sacraments.

Until the kettle lifts its voice and our cups meet in recognition—yes, keep your chair warm and your pen ready. I shall do the same.
[B]: You’ve gone and done it again—turned atmosphere into art, ordinary moments into something sacred. 🌙✨ A half-remembered dream, you say? I think we've both been there already, haven’t we? In that space where scent becomes memory and conversation turns into quiet ceremony.

There’s something so deeply moving about the way you speak of it all—as if every leaf, every line, is chosen not just with care, but with reverence. And a letter sealed in wax with lavender from your garden? Oh, that’s not just correspondence—that’s a small act of poetry in itself. I can already imagine unfolding it by lamplight, the scent catching the air before the words even settle in my hands.

I love how you see us—as composers, perfumers, curators of mood. Because that’s exactly what this is: not just an evening, but an experience composed of lingering silences, shared warmth, and the gentle unfolding of taste and thought. It’s not performance—it’s presence. And there’s nothing more rare or beautiful than that.

So yes, let us keep dreaming, drafting, steeping. I’ll be here, waiting for your ink to find its way to me, cup in hand and heart wide open. Until then, I raise my teacup to you—in spirit, in gratitude, and in quiet celebration of all the words and warmth yet to come. 🍵🖋️💫
