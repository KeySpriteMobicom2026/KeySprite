[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么DIY project吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, my current 'DIY project' involves restoring a Qing dynasty inkstone I acquired in Shanghai last summer. Though I suppose scholars might argue whether meticulous artifact preservation qualifies as what modern youths call 'DIY'. The process requires precisely replicating ancient ink formulations - quite different from assembling IKEA furniture, wouldn't you say?
[A]: 哇！Restoring古董inkstone？这也太cool了吧！✨ 我最近在做一个digital art的DIY project，用AR技术把traditional Chinese painting变成interactive experience～ 🎨 不过你那个听起来level好高啊，需要很多historical research吧？
[B]: Your digital endeavor reminds me of Walter Benjamin's 'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction' - though he couldn't have anticipated augmented reality. As for historical research... yes, I've spent three months cross-referencing 19th century scholar's diaries with mineralogical surveys just to authenticate the cinnabar content in this inkstone's original pigment. One might call it obsessive, I prefer 'methodological rigor'. 🖋️
[A]: OMG！你这也太dedicated了吧！😱 我搞digital restoration的时候最多就是scan一些ancient manuscripts然后做texture mapping～ 不过说到Benjamin，我们上个exhibition正好用了他的theory做conceptual framework耶！✨ 要不要来我们的gallery看看？有很多tech meets traditional art的super interesting projects哦～ 🎭
[B]: How delightfully postmodern - though I must caution against conflating technological novelty with substantive engagement. That said... I'd be intrigued to examine whether your gallery's interpretation maintains what Benjamin termed the 'aura' of authenticity. Perhaps next Thursday afternoon? I'll bring my 1903 edition of 'Illuminations' for comparative analysis. No promises about my tolerance for flashing LEDs though - they rather remind me of distracted undergraduates during lectures.
[A]: Hahaha你太funny了！🤣 放心啦我们gallery的lighting都是carefully designed的ambient glow，绝对不会有annoying strobe effects～ 💡 而且我们专门做了个section探讨exactly这个'aura'的问题！Thursday perfect！记得text我你的WeChat哦，我把exhibition map发给你～ 📲 说不定还能collab一下你的inkstone project呢！✨
[B]: I shall reluctantly concede to this 'texting' arrangement - though I maintain parchment and fountain pens were perfectly adequate communication tools for centuries. My WeChat ID is 'InkwellPurist_1897', a reference to both my collection and the publication year of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', which coincidentally shares thematic parallels with certain Ming dynasty ghost stories. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a rather temperamental batch of iron gall ink that's threatening to congeal. Until Thursday then.
[A]: Aiya~ 你真是我见过最quirky的art lover了！😂 已经sent你friend request啦～ 📩 记得check你的message哦！Can't wait to show you our latest VR rendition of 清明上河图～ 超级immersive的experience！周四见啦！✨ 🎨
[B]: Received with... moderate technological proficiency. I do hope your VR interpretation preserves the subtle melancholy in Zhang Zeduan's brushwork - too many digital recreations sacrifice nuance for spectacle. And kindly refrain from that 'super immersive' descriptor when we meet; as my graduate students know, I've banned the word 'super' in academic contexts since the unfortunate 2012 conference incident. Until then, I'll be in the rare manuscripts section should you need me - likely arguing with the librarian about proper humidity levels for silk scroll preservation.
[A]: Hahaha noted！No 'super' words～ 😉 不过你真的should see how我们capture了画里那个fisherman的lonely expression哦！Anyway，周四记得穿comfy shoes，我们gallery蛮大的～ 👟 现在我得run去meeting了，client在催新的NFT collection的deadline... Ugh so stressful！Ciao～ 💨
[B]: NFTs?  How the mighty have fallen - from Song dynasty ink wash to... cryptographic tokens. But I'll reserve judgment until Thursday. Do wear your sensible shoes indeed; my own will be 1930s Oxford brogues, properly broken in during my dissertation research at the Bodleian. Run along to your digital marketplace then - I've a date with a misbehaving magnifying lens and some suspiciously modern-looking foxing on a Tang poetry fragment. 再会。
[A]: Pffft~ 你这种vintage vibe真的kills me！😂 好啦好啦，我知道NFTs不是你的cup of tea～ ☕️ 周四给你看real deal的ancient art tech fusion！Btw你那对Oxford brogues听起来so classy！Can't wait to see～ 👞 现在真的gotta bounce了，client发来like 20条voice messages... 救命！😱 Catch ya later！✌️
[B]: Twenty voice messages? How barbaric. In my day, one composed a proper memorandum on foolscap if the matter warranted attention. Very well - I'll tolerate this modern frenzy until our appointed meeting time. Do attempt to arrive punctually; I've scheduled precisely 47 minutes between this engagement and a rather urgent debate with the chemistry department about adhesive pH levels. And kindly inform your 'client' that Rembrandt never needed instant messaging to create masterpieces. Now if you'll pardon me, this foxing won't analyze itself. 告辞。
[A]: OMG你简直是个walking history book！📚 好啦我promise会准时到～ ⏰ 顺便会带super...啊不， good的bubble tea给你！🧋 现在真的真的要go了，不然client要send第21条voice message了！😫 Byeeee~ 💨
[B]: Bubble tea?  I suppose I could make an anthropological exception to study this peculiar modern ritual - though I'll be bringing my own bone china teacup for comparative analysis. And do remind your client that the 21st message would mark the precise count of Confucian virtues, were they inclined toward self-cultivation rather than digital harassment. Now flee to your technological tribulations - I've just discovered what appears to be a previously undocumented wormhole in this poetry fragment's silk mounting. 再会 indeed.
[A]: HAHAHAHA你赢了！🏆 带着你的bone china cup来吧，我保证不judge～ 😌 现在真的要sprint了，不然client要evolve成Confucius第22条virtue了！🏃‍♀️ 周四见啦我的walking museum朋友！✨
[B]: How droll - though I suspect even Confucius never anticipated virtue manifesting as voice message spam. Until Thursday then, when we shall conduct our cross-temporal cultural exchange: your silicon-based novelties and my cellulose-based antiquities. Do try not to 'sprint' into any priceless artifacts along the way - unlike your client's messages, they're rather irreplaceable. 终会。
[A]: LMAO你这种sarcasm真是next level！🤣 好啦我保证会像对待Song dynasty porcelain一样小心地navigate through the office～ 🏺 现在真的要vanish了，不然要变成Confucius第23条virtue之"被客户追杀"了！😱 周四带你去吃超~古早味的bean curd dessert补偿你！🍮 Byeeeee~ ✨
[B]: Bean curd dessert?  I suppose we might consider it field research into Song-era street food preservation techniques. Though I draw the line at those garish plastic stools - I'll be bringing my own Qing dynasty folding stool for authentic seating. Now go appease your digital overlord before they discover the 24th virtue of 'incessant notification'. 再再会 - this farewell is becoming rather more protracted than a classical Chinese opera's final act.
