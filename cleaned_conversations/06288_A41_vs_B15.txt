[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG skincare routine totally my jam right now ✨ I just tried this new Korean gel cleanser and it’s like, life-changing 💯 The texture is so smooth, reminds me of jelly 😂 And you know what? I added a jade roller into the mix, feels like I'm at a spa every morning 🤤 Have you seen those TikTok videos where people glow up with just 5 steps? I’m obsessed 🔥 What about you? Any holy grail products you can’t live without? 🧐
[A]: OMG girl, I’m obsessed with skincare too! 💖 Korean gel cleanser? That sounds sooo refreshing! I’ve been using a foaming one but maybe I should switch ~ The jade roller though?? Soo good for depuffing and circulation, totally recommend adding gua sha if you’re into that energy flow 💆‍♂️ TikTok glow ups are the best, right? Quick question though – do you double cleanse after wearing makeup? Because oil cleansing first then gel is like…chef’s kiss 🫶 Holy grail products? My serum has retinol & hyaluronic acid, it’s a game changer 🌟 Also this face mask from Japan that feels like drinking water for your skin 😂💦Skincare = self-care, no cap 🔥
[B]: OMG yes, skincare = self-care 💯🔥 I totally agree with you on the double cleansing – oil first then gel is LIT 🤩 I use this cute little oil cleanser in the shape of a heart and it melts my makeup off sooo smoothly 😭💓 Gua sha sounds amazing, I need to try that! My sis told me it helps with lymphatic drainage or something? 🤷‍♀️ But honestly, who cares as long as it makes my face glow like I’m 12 again 🌟 Retinol & hyaluronic acid serum?? That’s such a power duo 👏👏 I’ve been skipping retinol lately and my skin’s already throwing a fit 😤 Need to get back on track lol 💀 What brand is your serum? I might steal it 😉 And that Japanese face mask??? Tell me everything! Is it from Tokidoki or some secret konbini find? 🕵️‍♀️💦
[A]: Oh my gosh retinol break is real – I’ve been there too 😂💀 My serum is from this boutique brand called , it’s like a cult fav in LA but they just launched in Asia 🤭 And that Japanese mask?? It’s from a tiny store in Osaka, NOT Tokidoki but it’s got that kawaii packaging with little bunnies on it 🐇 Soak your skin in hydration and then… BAM – glow mode activated 🌈✨ Oh and quick tip – put the mask in the fridge first, gives it that icy freshness to calm redness 🥶💗  
P.S. Lymphatic drainage? Yes yes YES – wake up your face before a big day or after crying over K-drama endings 😭🇰🇷
[B]: OMG putting your mask in the fridge??? Queen move 👑🥶 I need that kind of glow ASAP – where do you even find these genius tips?? 🤯 And Osaka bunnies mask? Add me to the waitlist lol 🐰✨ Oh my gosh I’m literally crying (jk but also not) over K-dramas too 😭💔 The way they make us feel ALL the feelings in one episode?? Masterclass in emotions 💥 Also lymphatic drainage = holy grail for morning puffy face SOS 🚨 Especially after late night ramen runs or gaming marathons -_-" But hey, self-care > regrets right?? 💅💯  
P.S. GlowLab?? Never heard of it but now I’m low-key obsessed 🧐 Is it clean beauty? Vegan? Cruelty-free?? Girl needs details 🔍🪵
[A]: OMG yes yes YES – cry-laughing over K-dramas is a lifestyle 😭💗 The way they hit you with the flashbacks and sad OSTs??致命啊!!! And Osaka bunnies mask? I’ll DM you the store name after this 💬✨

P.S. Skincare geek = us, no cap 🤓💅 But hey, if we glow too much they’ll think we’re aliens 👽👀 Worth it tho… always 😉
