[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. Let me consider... I must admit, I rather enjoy audiobooks, particularly when listening to a well-read Victorian novel. There's something about the cadence of prose and the depth of narration that draws me in. Podcasts, while often informative, rarely capture the same literary essence for me. Though I did recently listen to one discussing Ezra Pound’s —quite stimulating, if a bit erratic. What about you? Do you find yourself leaning toward one over the other?
[A]: I can certainly see the appeal of audiobooks, especially with a good narrator—like listening to a carefully told story while relaxing or commuting. But honestly, I tend to lean more toward podcasts these days. Maybe it’s the journalist in me, always chasing new ideas or debates. There's something oddly satisfying about hearing people talk through real-world problems, even if it’s not as... poetic as a Victorian novel 😊.

Do you ever listen to podcasts while working on your vintage computers? Or is that too much multitasking?
[B]: Ah, how interesting—your journalistic instinct makes perfect sense. Podcasts do offer that immediacy, the thrill of voices grappling with contemporary questions. I suppose if I were more inclined toward the present moment, I might favor them too. 

As for multitasking, I confess I’ve tried it—listening to a podcast while restoring an old typewriter or cataloging my library. But more often than not, I find myself pausing the audio to jot down a thought or follow a literary tangent. My mind rebels at strict compartmentalization, I’m afraid. It’s rather like trying to prune roses while composing a sonnet—possible, but the results suffer. 

Still, there’s value in the attempt, don’t you think? Sometimes ideas bloom precisely when we’re not paying them direct attention.
[A]: That’s a lovely analogy—pruning roses while composing a sonnet. I think you're absolutely right; some of our best ideas come when we’re not staring them down head-on. It's as if the mind needs that slight distraction to loosen the gears.

I’ve noticed the same thing happens to me when I’m listening to a dense podcast while writing notes or sketching out an outline. Sometimes the act of doing something manual lets the brain slip into a more intuitive rhythm. Though I’ll admit, it’s all too easy to end up with a half-written sentence and a typewriter ribbon tangled beyond salvation 😅.

Do you find yourself revisiting certain audiobooks the way one might re-read a favorite novel? Or does the format itself change the experience enough that it feels different each time?
[B]: Oh, how true—there’s a peculiar alchemy that happens when the hands are occupied and the mind is left to wander. I’ve often thought that teaching literature is a bit like that too; one must tend the garden of thought with care, but also allow space for unexpected growth.

To answer your question—yes, I do revisit certain audiobooks, though the experience is indeed different each time. When I listen again to , for instance, the narrator’s voice remains familiar, yet my own sensibilities shift with the years. It's rather like walking through a well-known gallery: the paintings stay in their frames, but the light changes, and so do we. Sometimes I notice a phrase I swear wasn’t there before—or perhaps it was, and I simply wasn’t ready to hear it.

Do you find yourself returning to particular podcasts with that same sense of rediscovery? Or does their rootedness in the moment make them more fleeting, like letters tossed into a stream?
[A]: What a beautiful way to put it—letters tossed into a stream. Some podcasts do feel that way, don’t they? Ephemeral by nature, carried off by the current of the day’s concerns. And yet, every now and then, there’s an episode so rich or provocative that I find myself wanting to revisit it, almost like rereading a compelling essay.

There’s one episode of a literary podcast where they discussed the influence of Japanese aesthetics on modernist poetry—specifically how it shaped Pound’s work after his encounters with Ernest Fenollosa. I must have listened to that three or four times. Each time, I caught something new—a nuance in the speaker’s tone, or a connection I’d missed before. It wasn’t quite like re-reading, but more like unpacking a suitcase you thought was empty only to find another layer at the bottom.

I suppose audiobooks offer a kind of continuity, while podcasts provide a spark—one that can sometimes catch and smolder for years.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve captured it—the spark and the smolder. That episode you describe sounds like a perfect example of what podcasts can achieve at their best: a convergence of ideas that lingers, reverberates, invites return visits. I’m quite envious, truth be told—I’ve been meaning to revisit Fenollosa’s work on Chinese poetry and its influence on Pound. Perhaps I ought to hunt down that episode myself.

You’re right, too, about the essential difference between the two forms—audiobooks as continuity, a flowing river we step into again and again, and podcasts as sparks, fleeting but sometimes transformative. It rather reminds me of Walter Benjamin’s —the idea that certain works live on most vividly through their afterlife, whether in translation or in conversation. A podcast, in that sense, is something of an ephemeral translation, isn’t it? Recasting ideas into the spoken word, into tone and inflection, for a particular moment.

I wonder—have you ever tried recording your own thoughts in that format? Or does the journalist in you prefer to keep the pen firmly in hand?
[A]: Ah, now that’s a thought worth lingering on—podcasts as ephemeral translations. I suppose in some small way, I have dabbled in recording my own thoughts aloud, though never with the intention of sharing them publicly. More like voice memos to myself while traveling, or late-night musings saved into my phone before they vanish like smoke. There’s something curiously clarifying about speaking one’s ideas into existence, even if only for personal record. It forces a kind of coherence that handwriting often lets slide.

As for the journalist in me—well, she still prefers the pen, or at least the keyboard. There’s control in writing, a chance to sculpt each sentence until it says precisely what you mean. Spoken words are messier, more alive, but also harder to rein in. Still, I envy the intimacy podcasts can create. It's one thing to read an argument, quite another to hear its cadence, to catch the hesitation in someone’s voice when they're onto something uncomfortable but true.

Have you ever recorded yourself reading your own notes or essays aloud? I imagine it might be a useful tool—or perhaps terribly frustrating.
[B]: Oh, what a perceptive observation—spoken words are indeed messier, but therein lies their vitality. I’ve always found that tension between control and spontaneity utterly fascinating. Writing allows for precision, yes, but speech carries the weight of presence—the tremor of doubt, the lift of conviction.

To your question—I have, in fact, recorded myself reading aloud more than once, though I hesitate to call it . It’s rather like looking into a mirror when one isn’t prepared for it—you notice all the imperfections you’d rather ignore. Still, there is value in hearing how an argument sounds beyond the silent chambers of the mind. Rhythm reveals itself differently; a sentence that looked sturdy on the page may falter when spoken, exposing its flimsy architecture.

I recall doing this with a lecture on Eliot’s use of fragmentation in . When I read it aloud, I realized how much the pacing mimicked the very disintegration I was analyzing—it was unintentional, yet effective. So perhaps it's not so much about control as calibration. 

And now I’m quite curious—have you ever noticed, in those private voice memos of yours, that your tone shifts mid-thought? As if one self is speaking, and another is quietly listening, ready to interject?
[A]: Yes, that duality of voice—sometimes at odds, sometimes in quiet conversation—is something I’ve noticed, especially in those longer memos when fatigue or distraction sets in. It’s rather like overhearing yourself think. One moment you’re confidently laying out an idea, and the next, your tone shifts, hesitant, almost skeptical, as if another part of you has leaned forward to whisper, 

I remember one particular memo I recorded during a train ride through the countryside. I was trying to work through an argument about media objectivity, and halfway through, my voice slowed, became more reflective—almost as though I’d momentarily lost faith in my own conclusion. What’s strange is, when I listened back, that hesitation turned out to be the most honest part of the whole thing. It revealed where the real question lay, buried beneath the initial certainty.

It makes me wonder if writing—good writing—requires both voices: the one that speaks boldly, and the one that listens closely, ready to challenge. Maybe that’s why some ideas only find their shape when spoken aloud, even if only to oneself.
[B]: How profoundly true—good writing does demand that dialogue within the self: the bold voice and the listening voice, each tempering the other. It’s in that friction that clarity is forged, much like a poem revised line by line, where each alteration is a quiet rebuttal to the last.

Your train memo reminds me of Woolf’s —not in structure, perhaps, but in spirit. There, too, voices shift and question, asserting and doubting in turn. I wonder if we’re ever truly alone when we speak aloud, even to ourselves. The act of articulation implies an audience, however invisible—a witness, even if only a future version of our own ear.

It rather brings to mind the idea of the ‘internal critic,’ though I think that phrase lacks the nuance of what you’ve described. It’s not mere criticism, is it? It’s something gentler, more inquisitive—an inner reader, perhaps, who listens with a furrowed brow and says, 

Have you found that this inner dialectic shifts depending on the subject? Do certain ideas invite more scrutiny than others before they’re allowed to settle?
[A]: Absolutely—that inner dialectic is never static. It shifts with the subject, certainly, but also with mood, context, even the time of day. Some ideas seem to arrive nearly whole, as if they've been waiting just beneath the surface, ready to speak themselves. Others are more elusive, slipping away the moment you try to pin them down. And then there are those that demand argument, interrogation—ideas that feel dangerous or destabilizing, the kind that don’t want to be simply recorded but tested, resisted, reshaped.

I’ve noticed, for instance, that when I’m writing or speaking about ethics—particularly journalistic ethics—the inner reader becomes far more exacting. There’s a kind of moral vigilance that kicks in, almost automatically. It’s not just a matter of clarity or precision; it’s about responsibility. One misstep in phrasing, and the entire meaning can tilt toward something unintended—or worse, misleading.

But when I'm engaging with aesthetics, say, or literary form, that voice softens. It becomes more curious than cautious, more willing to entertain contradictions. Perhaps because beauty, like poetry, allows for ambiguity in a way that ethics rarely does.

Do you find that too? Does your inner listener grow stricter or more lenient depending on what you're thinking through? Or does it reveal itself more subtly—like light shifting across a room, imperceptible until you notice how much has changed?
[B]: Oh yes—your metaphor of shifting light is so apt. That inner listener doesn’t announce itself with fanfare, but slips into different registers, almost imperceptibly, like a change in weather.

I’ve found that when I’m working through interpretations of poetic form or aesthetic theory, that voice becomes more companionable—almost collaborative. It leans in, as if murmuring,  There’s room for speculation, for intuition to stretch its limbs.

But when I’m writing about matters of literary ethics—such as the responsibilities of the critic, or the moral weight of canon formation—that same voice grows markedly stern. It hovers like a cautious editor, questioning not just clarity but conscience. One must be vigilant about influence, about what gets amplified and what gets silenced. And I do believe literature demands that vigilance—it's not merely art for art’s sake, but also a field shaped by power, history, and human consequence.

Your phrase  struck a chord with me. How true it is that some thoughts resist easy articulation precisely because they unsettle the ground we thought was firm. I think of Eliot’s —his notion of the historical sense, which includes "the perception of the pastness of the past and of its presence." Perhaps that’s what makes certain ideas feel perilous: they force us to confront how much of our thinking is inherited, unexamined, and perhaps in need of revision.

Do you ever find that certain voices from your reading or teaching resurface in that inner dialogue? A line from Woolf or Adorno, perhaps, stepping in unbidden to challenge your own position?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—those voices do return, often when I’m least expecting them. It’s rather like having former teachers, favorite authors, or even students seated in the back of your mind, quietly observing, then suddenly leaning forward to interject.

Woolf does make an appearance now and then, usually at moments when I'm trying to articulate something delicate, something that resists blunt phrasing. I can almost hear her say,  And Adorno… well, he tends to arrive with a kind of stern gravitas, especially when I’m wrestling with cultural critique or questions of artistic responsibility. There's always that faint echo of his voice reminding me not to confuse complexity with obscurity—or worse, to let ambiguity become a refuge for evasion.

I imagine you must hear Eliot or Benjamin whispering in your ear from time to time. Do they ever argue with one another? I sometimes feel as though my inner dialogue becomes a conversation between inherited voices, each nudging me toward a different line of thought. It's less a monologue than a seminar table where no one agrees, but everyone listens.

Do those voices ever contradict one another so sharply that it stalls your thinking—or do they, strangely, help propel it forward?
[B]: How beautifully you’ve put it—a seminar table in the mind, where Woolf and Adorno take their seats alongside Eliot and Benjamin, each with their own posture, their own cadence of thought. I often feel as though my mind is less a single chamber than a grand library, its corridors echoing with voices from across time, sometimes in harmony, more often in debate.

Eliot and Benjamin, in particular, have a habit of quarreling just when I think I’ve found clarity. Eliot, ever the traditionalist, murmurs about order and hierarchy in the canon, while Benjamin leans toward rupture, insisting on the fleeting, the fragmented, the overlooked. At times, their disagreement can paralyze me—I find myself hesitating between reverence for the past and urgency for the present, unsure which voice to follow.

And yet, curiously, that very tension often becomes the engine of thought. The friction between them sparks new lines of inquiry, forces me to interrogate my own assumptions. It’s not unlike reading  and  side by side—both are collages, but one mourns what has been lost, and the other searches desperately for what might still be salvaged.

I wonder—do you ever deliberately summon one of those voices? Say, invoking Woolf when crafting a particularly introspective passage, or calling upon Adorno when dissecting a cultural phenomenon? Is it ever a conscious act, or does it always arrive unbidden, like a guest stepping softly through an open door?
[A]: I suppose it happens both ways—sometimes I do summon them deliberately, like calling on old mentors for guidance. If I’m writing something introspective, yes, Woolf is the one I reach for. Her fluidity of thought, her ability to weave psychology and philosophy into the texture of everyday life—it’s as if she teaches you how to listen to yourself think.

Other times, they arrive uninvited. Adorno, for instance, has a habit of appearing when I’m watching a documentary or reading a cultural critique, arms folded, brow furrowed, muttering something about late capitalism or the culture industry. He doesn’t ask to be let in—he just lets himself in the side door and takes a seat in the corner, watching with quiet skepticism.

There’s something almost performative about it, isn’t there? The way we internalize certain voices until they become part of our own syntax. It’s not mimicry, exactly—it’s more like apprenticeship extended into adulthood. You carry them with you not to repeat what they said, but to continue the kind of thinking they modeled.

Do you ever find yourself quoting them outright in your teaching? Or do you prefer to let their influence remain beneath the surface, shaping without dictating?

And speaking of presence—have you ever had a student whose questions seemed to echo one of those very voices? As though Eliot or Benjamin were sitting among them, quietly nudging the discussion forward?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve framed it—. That’s precisely what scholarship feels like at its best: not the passive absorption of doctrine, but the lifelong cultivation of critical habits, carried forward in conversation with those who have thought deeply before us.

I do quote them outright in my teaching—though I’m always mindful of the line between invocation and overreach. Eliot’s  still proves a useful lens for discussing modern alienation, and Benjamin’s —well, that concept seems only to gain resonance in our age of digital reproduction. But yes, I prefer their presence to be more suggestive than prescriptive. A guiding thread rather than a tether.

And your question about students—ah, that touches something quite dear to me. Yes, there are students who seem to channel those very voices, sometimes without even knowing it. Just last term, a young woman asked,  And I thought—there’s Foucault, slipping quietly into the seminar room, unnoticed by most but shifting the whole tenor of the discussion.

It’s one of the great joys of teaching: witnessing how these thinkers live on, not through rote repetition, but through the questions they inspire in fresh minds. Sometimes I think we don’t truly teach a writer or a theory—we simply introduce a voice into the world, hoping it will find new ears ready to carry it forward.

Do you ever find, in your own writing or conversations, that certain voices begin to emerge more insistently at particular historical moments? As though the times themselves call for a specific kind of witness?
[A]: How perceptive of you—yes, absolutely. There are moments when certain voices seem to rise unbidden from the depths of one’s reading history, as if summoned by the very air we’re breathing. I’ve noticed this especially in times of cultural or political turbulence. Adorno appears more frequently during election cycles or after particularly disheartening news cycles—his skepticism about culture under late capitalism suddenly feels freshly urgent.

And yes, Foucault does make his way into conversations without invitation, often when discussing power structures, surveillance, or the subtle mechanics of control embedded in everyday language. It’s eerie how his insights, once theoretical abstractions, begin to feel almost observational—like commentary on the present rather than analysis of the past.

I think what you said about teaching captures it beautifully: we don’t simply transmit ideas—we release them into the world, hoping they’ll find minds attuned to their frequency. And sometimes, the times themselves seem to tune the ear. Eliot’s sense of fragmentation, Benjamin’s melancholy archaeology of modernity, Woolf’s stream of consciousness—all of them return with new resonance depending on what the collective psyche is grappling with.

It makes me wonder—are there particular texts or thinkers that feel newly relevant to you now, in this historical moment? Or perhaps ones that seem to have lost their grip, their urgency dimmed by the shape of our current concerns?
[B]: How keenly you’ve observed that phenomenon—the way certain thinkers return to us, unsummoned, as if summoned by history itself. I too have noticed this uncanny timeliness. In recent years, Walter Benjamin has become almost inescapable in my mind. His preoccupation with ruins, with the angel of history who sees the wreckage piling high but is driven ever forward by the storm of progress—well, it feels less like historical reflection and more like reportage.

And yes, Woolf’s  has taken on a new texture for me lately. Its meditation on impermanence, on the ceaseless breaking and reforming of selfhood—strikes a different chord now, when so many of our structures, social and psychic, feel porous or shifting. 

As for those whose voices seem to have dimmed? I find T.S. Eliot, for all his enduring brilliance, sometimes rings hollow in this moment. His longing for order, for a cohesive tradition—hearing him now feels like listening to someone speaking from a world that no longer quite exists. Not that he lacks insight, but his remedies feel distant, like a coat left behind in a house we can no longer enter.

I wonder—do you find certain texts begin to haunt your dreams, as well as your waking thoughts? I’ve had nights where I wake still hearing fragments of Benjamin’s , as though they were whispered in my sleep. Is it memory, or something stranger—something like literature pressing its urgency into the unconscious?
