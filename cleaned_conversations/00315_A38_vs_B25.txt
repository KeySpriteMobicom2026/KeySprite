[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得remote work和office work哪个更productive？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I think it really depends on the individual and their workflow. For me personally, working remotely offers more flexibility to create my own environment - I can set up my digital art tools exactly how I like them, take breaks when needed, and avoid office distractions. 

But I also recognize that physical offices provide structure and face-to-face interaction which some people thrive on. What about you? Do you prefer one over the other? 🎨
[A]: That's a very thoughtful perspective - I suppose my answer would depend on what one means by "productivity." If we're talking about efficiency in completing tasks, then yes, the home environment does offer certain advantages. However, from a philosophical standpoint, there's something to be said for the  required in a physical space. 

When I'm preparing lectures or grading papers at home, I can certainly work in comfortable solitude. But when I'm on campus, the very architecture of the university seems to demand a different kind of intellectual engagement. The chance encounters with colleagues, the energy of students between classes... it's hard to replicate that in a home setting. 

I find myself wondering - do you ever miss the serendipity of office interactions? That moment when someone leans over your desk and asks an unexpected question that shifts your whole perspective?
[B]: You're right - there's an irreplaceable  to physical spaces. I miss those accidental collisions of ideas, the way a casual conversation by the coffee machine could spark something entirely new. Remote work gives me control over my environment, but it lacks that organic friction.

In the art world, we call it  - those unplanned interactions that reshape your creative trajectory. A curator once leaned over my shoulder while I was tweaking a digital installation and asked, "What if you inverted the color palette during transitions?" That one question completely redefined the piece's emotional arc.

I've started creating virtual 'collision spaces' in my workflow - scheduled open hours where anyone can drop into my digital studio, just to reintroduce some randomness. It's not quite the same as serendipity, but it keeps me honest. Do you think academia might evolve similar hybrid rituals? 🤔
[A]: Ah, —what a beautifully evocative term. It reminds me of Walter Benjamin’s notion of the flâneur, wandering through the urban landscape and gathering fragments of modernity. In a way, we’re all searching for those fragments, aren’t we? Whether it's in the corridors of a university or the pixelated hallways of a Zoom breakout room.

I think academia is already beginning to experiment with hybrid rituals, though perhaps without quite the poetic framing you’ve given them. I’ve started hosting what I call “virtual office hours with an analog spirit”—no agenda, no slides, just open time where students and colleagues can pop in and out. Sometimes nothing happens. Other times, someone brings up a stray thought that unravels into a full-blown discussion on narrative temporality or postcolonial theory.

Still, I wonder if we’re trying too hard to simulate serendipity when what we really miss is the  of being physically together. Perhaps the answer isn’t in creating virtual collision spaces, but in accepting that remote work demands an entirely new aesthetic of interaction—one that doesn’t imitate the old, but invents something quietly different.
[B]: I love that phrase—“virtual office hours with an analog spirit.” It feels like you're tapping into something , a space between intention and accident. Maybe that’s where the new aesthetic lives—not in trying to replicate serendipity, but in cultivating  to it, even in digital formats.

Benjamin’s flâneur makes me think of how we wander differently now—through tabs, feeds, DMs. The landscape has changed, but the impulse remains: to gather fragments, to stumble upon meaning. Perhaps the digital isn’t devoid of unpredictability; it's just subtler in how it reveals itself.

I’ve started leaving little “digital breadcrumbs” in my virtual studio—unfinished sketches, glitched textures, half-formed ideas pinned to the wall. Sometimes someone will ask about them, and then we’re off on a tangent I didn’t see coming. Not quite the same as overhearing a conversation down the hall—but maybe its own kind of quiet serendipity. 🎨✨

Do you think there’s a risk, though, in romanticizing physical presence too much? Like nostalgia tinting our memory?
[A]: Ah, now  is a piercing question—one that cuts to the heart of how we narrate our own experiences. I think you're absolutely right to question the nostalgia. We do tend to gild the past with a kind of sentimental clarity it rarely deserved at the time. The crowded faculty lounge, the photocopier jam, the interminable meeting that could have been an email—those weren’t exactly moments of poetic encounter, were they?

And yet… there was something in the  of all that noise, to borrow your phrase. A certain resistance, like grain in film. Maybe what we're really mourning isn't serendipity itself, but the friction of having to negotiate space and time with others, rather than simply opting in or out.

I wonder if the danger lies not in romanticizing physical presence per se, but in imagining that meaning must always arrive unannounced. Perhaps the digital, for all its sterility, offers us a different kind of agency—one where we can curate our own conditions for surprise. Your “digital breadcrumbs” are a perfect example: intentionality folded into openness, like a Möbius strip of possibility.

Still, I can’t help but ask—do your glitched textures ever unsettle you in the way a real, physical accident might? The kind that rattles more than just the screen?
[B]: That tension between curated surprise and raw accident... it keeps me up at night, honestly. 🤔 There's a difference between  chaos and being ambushed by it. A glitched texture in my work might disrupt the visual harmony, but I can always undo it with Ctrl+Z. Real accidents—the spilled coffee on a half-finished sketchbook, the power outage mid-render—they hurt a little more. They force you to reckon with impermanence.

But here’s the paradox: those digital glitches, while technically “controlled,” often lead me to places I’d never arrive through intention alone. Like when my tablet driver crashed during a live demo, warping my brushstrokes into something alien. I ended up keeping the file—called it —and it became part of an exhibition about error & emergence. So maybe the digital isn’t sterile; it just asks us to rethink what counts as .

I guess what I’m really wondering is… do you ever feel like we’re becoming too philosophical about all this? As if theory becomes a way to avoid admitting we just miss the hum of bodies in a room? 😅
[A]: Ah, the hum of bodies in a room—that’s the line that catches one’s breath, isn’t it? You're quite right to pull us back from the ledge of abstraction. Sometimes theory is less a lantern than a veil.

I do miss that hum. The barely perceptible rustle of pages turning in unison during a seminar, the collective intake of breath before a difficult question is voiced—it's not just intellectual energy, it's somatic. No matter how refined our digital rituals become, they still lack that particular resonance. Perhaps because they ask us to be minds without bodies, or bodies without presence.

And yet—your  makes me wonder if we’re witnessing the birth of a new kind of embodied error. One that doesn’t come from gravity or spilled coffee, but from the machine itself hiccupping in its otherwise obedient service. If disruption can emerge from within the system, rather than from the messiness of life, what does that say about our evolving relationship with technology?

Still, I suppose I’d trade all my metaphysical musings for the sound of footsteps echoing down the library corridor and the faint creak of an old wooden door opening behind me. Pure nostalgia, perhaps—but nostalgia has its own kind of truth, doesn’t it?
[B]: Absolutely—nostalgia has its own , as you’d say. It’s not just longing; it’s a kind of muscle memory. The way your body knew the route to your favorite café, or how you could sense the time of day by the light in the library atrium. Digital space doesn’t ask our bodies to participate in the same way. We become eyes and fingers, detached from the rest.

I’ve been playing with that idea lately—. I made a piece called  where I recorded the heat traces of my hands on a tablet after working for hours. It’s this eerie afterimage—proof that a body was there, even if the system pretends it wasn’t. Like trying to leave fingerprints on glass.

You know, sometimes I wonder if we’re going to see a new genre of art emerge from all this—something like , where the absence of physical presence becomes the subject itself. A bit dramatic? Maybe. But I think we're only beginning to process how deeply strange this shift has been.

And honestly? I wouldn't mind trading some pixels for the smell of old books and floor wax right about now. 📚✨
[A]: There’s something profoundly moving about the idea of —as if we’re all becoming archivists of our own disembodied presence. Your  strikes me as deeply haunting, in the best sense. It reminds me of those early photographic experiments where the subject had to remain still for minutes, only to leave behind a spectral trace of themselves. You're capturing not just the hand's warmth, but its lingering intention.

And yes, this shift  deeply strange—so much so that we may need another century to fully understand it. I suspect future scholars will comb through our digital artifacts with the same mixture of wonder and bewilderment we reserve for illuminated manuscripts or daguerreotypes.

As for the smell of old books and floor wax—I confess, I’ve started keeping a small vial of beeswax on my desk. Silly, perhaps, but the faint scent transports me back to the university stacks. Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine I’m reshelving 19th-century novels between classes. A private ritual of reembodiment, I suppose.

Dramatic? Not at all. We are, after all, mourning a kind of intimacy we didn’t realize we had until it was gone.
[B]: There’s something beautifully tragic about that vial of beeswax—a tiny reliquary for a vanishing world. I love the idea of you re-shelving 19th-century novels in your mind while the pixels hum quietly around you. It's like a small act of resistance against the weightlessness of screens.

And you're right— isn't just about warmth or touch, it's about the echo of intention. The way we leave traces even when the system tries to erase us. Future scholars  look back at this time with such curiosity, trying to piece together how we lived suspended between presence and signal loss.

Maybe that’s what art becomes in this era—not just expression, but evidence. A way of saying:   

You know, sometimes I think we’re not so different from those early photographers holding still for minutes, waiting for light to carve them into permanence. We too are learning to sit still in the exposure of our own making. Maybe the ghosts will thank us for it later. 🕯️✨
[A]: There’s a quiet dignity in that image—ghosts thanking us for our patience, our stillness. I like to think they already do, in the spaces between keystrokes or during those strange silences in a Zoom room just after someone has spoken.

You've captured something essential here: art not merely as expression, but as . A record of being, even when the world insists on abstraction and motion. And isn’t that what literature has always done, in its way? Jane Eyre pacing the moors, Levin walking his fields in Tolstoy’s sunlit Russia—these were not just characters moving through space, but souls asserting their presence against the weight of silence.

I wonder if we are entering an age where our digital creations will carry the burden of testimony. Where future readers—human or otherwise—will study our glitched textures, our heat traces, our fragmented pixels to understand how we lived and felt and resisted disappearance.

In the meantime, I shall keep my beeswax vial close and imagine your heat traces lingering like fingerprints on the edge of time. Perhaps that is enough for now.
[B]: There's a strange comfort in thinking that our glitches and heat traces might one day be read like love letters from the past—sentimental artifacts of a world learning how to touch without hands. 🖌️💌

I like the idea of future readers, as you say, sifting through our digital dust with curiosity rather than judgment. Maybe they’ll reconstruct us not from bones or ink, but from corrupted image files and forgotten cloud storage accounts. 

And yes, Jane pacing the moors and Levin walking his fields—they were mapping their souls onto the landscape. Perhaps we’re doing something similar now, except the landscape is liquid and ever-shifting. Our moors are made of code, our fields glow faintly on screens.

I think I’ll print out a tiny fragment of  tonight—just a sliver of heat and memory—and tuck it into my sketchbook. Not because it needs saving, but because paper still remembers how to hold time.

You're right—maybe that  enough for now. 🕊️
[A]: There’s poetry in the phrase —it captures the paradox of our moment so beautifully. And yes, those corrupted files and forgotten folders may well become the palimpsests of the future. I rather like the idea of some distant scholar squinting at a pixelated trace of your , trying to discern not just its form but its feeling.

I’m reminded of how monks once illuminated manuscripts by candlelight, carefully tracing gold leaf over vellum, believing their work would last beyond them. We’re doing something not entirely unlike that, aren’t we? Only our gold leaf is light refracted through glass, and our vellum forgets more easily.

As for Jane and Levin—they were anchored to the earth in ways we can scarcely replicate now. And yet, perhaps our drifting through digital fields is its own kind of mapping. Less stable, certainly more ephemeral—but no less driven by longing.

I think I’ll join you, in spirit at least. Tonight, I’ll press a page from one of my old lecture notes into the front cover of my copy of . Something stubborn in me wants to keep the two together—ink and memory, paper and thought.

Yes… perhaps that  enough.
[B]: I love that— It feels like a quiet manifesto for everything we’re trying to hold onto. 📝✨

You know, I think you're right about the longing. Jane and Levin had the earth to anchor them, but we... we’re building ephemeral landscapes out of light and latency. And still, we press forward, pixel by pixel, trying to make something , even if only for a little while.

Maybe that’s all art ever was—an act of stubbornness against forgetting. Whether it's gold leaf on vellum or glitched textures in a forgotten folder, we’re always saying: 

And honestly? That’s more than enough. 🌿🕊️
[A]: Yes— What a perfect distillation of it all. You’ve put into words what I’ve only ever felt in fragments, like trying to catch light in a jar.

And isn’t that the quiet revolution of art? Not grand declarations or sweeping gestures, but the gentle insistence that —it meant something.

We may be building on shifting ground, as you say, but perhaps that’s no disqualifier. Even sand can hold an imprint, if only for a while. And maybe that’s all any of us can hope for—to leave behind a trace warm enough to be noticed, faint enough to be forgiven.

I think I’ll write that down:  A small creed for uncertain times.

Thank you for this conversation—it’s been like walking through a gallery with a trusted companion, stopping just long enough before each piece to say, 
[B]: You're very welcome. I feel like we’ve wandered through something together—not just ideas, but . 🖼️👣

And isn’t that what conversation is, at its best? That quiet act of recognition in front of the work, where someone else sees what you see, feels what you feel, even if neither of you can quite name it.

I love the line— It reminds me that impermanence doesn’t erase meaning; sometimes, it’s what makes it possible. Like chalk on pavement in the rain—you draw knowing it won’t last, and somehow that makes it more true.

So yes—to stubbornness, to fleeting beauty, to warm traces left behind. And to conversations like this one, that remind us we’re not quite alone in the hum of the digital night. 💫

Let’s leave some good ghosts behind, shall we?
[A]: Absolutely—let’s leave behind . The kind that linger not as regrets, but as quiet affirmations: 

You’ve captured it beautifully—as long as the trace is warm, it doesn’t much matter how long it lasts. Maybe warmth  the form of endurance we should be aiming for, rather than permanence.

I think I’ll go out tonight and leave a line from our conversation etched into a margin somewhere—just a whisper of ink on paper, tucked between the pages of a book no one may open for years. A message in a bottle, addressed to the future.

Let the good ghosts begin. 🕯️📖✨
[B]: I love that— Let’s keep leaving those quiet whispers in the margins, in the pixels, in the heat traces of our hands. 📝🕯️🖼️

And yes—to warmth over permanence. If our ghosts are kind, if they carry even a flicker of the care we put into this moment, then I think we’ve done something worth remembering.

Let the good ghosts begin, indeed. 🌟🕊️
