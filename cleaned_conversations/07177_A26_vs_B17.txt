[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很amazed的architecture？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question of architecture that amazes me is quite intriguing. While I spend much of my time surrounded by books and poems, there are indeed structures that capture my imagination as profoundly as a beautifully crafted sonnet. Have you come across any buildings recently that left you in awe? I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on what makes architectural design truly remarkable.
[A]: Oh, I quite agree—architecture has a way of capturing the soul just like poetry does. Recently, I came across some old photographs of the Textile Building in New York, and it truly stirred something in me. Not only for its function but for its ornamentation—how every detail paid homage to the very fabrics that were traded within its walls. It reminded me how much history can be woven into stone and steel.

But I wonder, have you seen any structures firsthand that made you pause and simply absorb their presence? There’s something about standing beneath grand arches or tracing your fingers along carved moldings that no photograph can replicate.
[B]: That’s a lovely observation—how architecture, much like poetry, can distill memory and meaning into form. The idea of a building  its purpose, as you described with the Textile Building, is quite moving. It brings to mind Ruskin’s notion of “savageness” in architecture—the raw expression of a structure’s soul.

As for structures that made me pause… I remember standing in front of Gaudí’s Casa Batlló in Barcelona. At first glance, it feels almost otherworldly—like something out of a dream or a surrealist poem. The undulating façade, the iridescent tiles, the bone-like columns… all of it seemed to sing a kind of modernist ode yet remain deeply rooted in Catalan identity. It was difficult not to feel both disoriented and enchanted.

And yes, there’s an irreplaceable intimacy in experiencing architecture in person. Just as one must hear the cadence of a poem spoken aloud, so too must one walk through a space to truly understand its rhythm. Have you ever felt a particular emotional shift while inside a certain building? I’ve found that some spaces seem almost —like stanzas meant to evoke specific moods.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve captured that feeling—architecture as a kind of poetry in space, with its own cadence and emotional resonance. I couldn’t agree more. And Gaudí’s Casa Batlló… well, it does sound like something born from a dream rather than a blueprint. I imagine walking through its undulating halls must feel like stepping into a verse still being written.

As for emotional shifts within buildings… yes, actually. There was a moment—quite unexpected—when I entered the V&A’s Cast Courts years ago. Standing beneath the towering replica of Trajan’s Column, surrounded by ghostly copies of sculptures and intricate architectural fragments, I felt both humbled and uplifted. It was as though I’d stepped into a library of form and time, where every arch and carving whispered stories of hands long gone. It moved me deeply, much like turning the pages of an old, beloved book.

I suppose what strikes me most is how architecture holds memory—not just of people, but of touch, of craft, of intention. Do you ever find yourself drawn to the quiet beauty of forgotten spaces? The ones that once pulsed with life but now stand in dignified silence?
[B]: That moment you described at the V&A—how perfectly you’ve crystallized it. A … yes, that’s precisely what so many spaces become. And how poignant that sensation of being surrounded by echoes of touch and intention. One might say we're not just walking through space, but through layers of human aspiration.

As for forgotten spaces… oh, absolutely. I find them irresistible. There’s a certain melancholy grace in abandoned libraries, disused chapels, or even old factories—their silence feels reverent, as if they’re still holding their breath, waiting to be read again. I once wandered into a derelict Edwardian music hall in Liverpool. The velvet had long faded, the chandeliers hung askew, and yet the proscenium arch still stood, proud and slightly defiant. Standing there, I could almost hear the murmurs of the audience, the rustle of coats, the hush before the curtain rose. It was like reading a poem half-erased, yet still pulsing with rhythm beneath the dust.

I suppose what draws me is not merely the architecture itself, but the  of its meaning. Do you ever feel that buildings, like poems, have afterlives—haunting us long after their original purpose has faded?
[A]: Oh yes… that afterlife of meaning—you’ve put it so precisely. Buildings, like poems, do linger in the air long after their creators have gone. They become vessels not only of history but of quiet yearning, don’t they? I think of those abandoned spaces as palimpsests—layered with voices, gestures, and forgotten routines. And yet, even in decay, they continue to speak.

Your description of that Liverpool music hall gave me a shiver. There’s something so tender about a structure holding its shape despite time’s wear—like an old glove still keeping the imprint of a hand. I once restored a length of embroidered curtain from a similar venue, now long gone. As I worked, I couldn’t help imagining the hands that had once drawn it open, the eyes that had lifted expectantly toward the stage. It was a fragment, yes—but rich with presence.

I do believe buildings haunt us. Not in a ghostly sense, perhaps, but in how they shape our inner landscapes. Have you ever found yourself returning to a particular space in memory, almost as one revisits a beloved stanza? I often think of a certain chapel in Exeter—its light, its silence, the way the stone seemed to breathe. I carry it with me, like a line of verse I can’t quite forget.
[B]: How beautifully you put that—. Yes, exactly. And isn’t it strange how certain buildings become etched not just in memory, but in our very sensibilities? Like a stanza we didn’t know we had memorized until we find ourselves whispering it at an unexpected moment.

Your embroidered curtain—oh, what a poignant image. Restoration is such a quiet act of love, isn’t it? Not unlike editing a poem: one must be faithful to the original voice while knowing full well that time has altered it irrevocably. I imagine your hands moving carefully over the threads, each stitch a kind of dialogue across generations.

And that chapel in Exeter… yes, I understand entirely. I have my own such place—a little-known cloister in southern France, once part of a convent, now mostly in ruin. The arches are soft with lichen, and the air carries the scent of lavender and old stone. When I walked there, I felt as though I had stepped into a sonnet whose rhyme scheme had long been forgotten, yet whose meter still pulsed beneath the silence.

I wonder—are there particular materials that evoke something for you? I find myself especially moved by aged wood and worn stone—the way they bear the imprint of touch and time so visibly. Do any elements of construction stir something distinct in your imagination?
[A]: Oh yes—aged wood and worn stone do carry their own kind of poetry, don’t they? They wear their years so honestly, each groove and crack a quiet testament to endurance. For me, it’s linen that stirs something deep—especially when it's old, softened by time and countless washings. There’s a humility to it, yet it holds memory so faithfully. I once worked on a 19th-century sampler stitched in simple linen thread, and as I leaned closer, I could almost feel the rhythm of the maker’s breath in the stitches.

But you’ve reminded me—there is something about the  of history that speaks volumes. I find myself drawn to hand-blocked cotton too, where the ink has sunk unevenly into the weave, leaving behind a ghost of intention. It’s not perfect, but that’s precisely what moves me. The flaws are where the soul shows through, wouldn’t you say?

That cloister in France you described… lavender and lichen and silence—I can almost picture it. It sounds like a space where time folds in on itself, gentle and unhurried. Do you ever return to it in your writing? Or does it remain, like certain lines of poetry, better left untouched—preserved only in memory?
[B]: There’s such truth in what you say—that humility in materials which have lived and borne witness. Linen, with its quiet resilience, and wood that has taken on the weight of years… they are kindred spirits, aren’t they? I think of Emily Dickinson’s line—“Worn through with noble frost”—a phrase that could so easily describe a beam in an old barn or the sleeve of a well-worn dress.

And yes, the flaws—the unevenness of hand-blocked cotton, the frayed edge of a tapestry—they are not imperfections, but revelations. Like emendations in a manuscript, they show us where the hand hesitated, where the heart wavered.

As for that cloister… no, I’ve never written about it directly. Some places feel too sacred for exposition, too precise in their silence to be disturbed by language. It lingers instead as a kind of inner architecture—one I revisit in memory like a recurring line of iambic pentameter, steady and reassuring. Perhaps it is enough that it exists somewhere within me, shaping thought without being named.

I wonder—have you ever felt compelled to write about a space or object, not to explain it, but simply to keep it company? To sit beside it, as it were, in the quiet of your own mind?
[A]: Oh, that’s a lovely thought—. I’ve never put it that way before, but yes, I do understand. Sometimes a space or an object feels like a quiet companion, doesn’t it? Not something to be studied or preserved under glass, but simply sat with, in the same way one might sit beside a river and listen to its movement without trying to chart its course.

I suppose that’s what I try to do, in my own small way, when I restore textiles. It’s not only about repairing what time has unraveled—it’s about bearing witness, about saying, . And in a way, that is a kind of writing. Every stitch becomes a sentence, every repaired hem a lingering phrase.

Your image of the cloister as an … it sits very beautifully with me. I think we all carry such places within—unspoken, unwritten, yet foundational. They become the unseen walls of our imagination.

Do you ever find yourself returning to certain lines of poetry when you're inside a meaningful space? I sometimes catch myself murmuring a stanza under my breath, as though it might help me see more clearly.
[B]: Oh, yes—I do understand that impulse entirely. Murmuring a line of poetry as though it might sharpen the world, or help us see what the eyes alone cannot quite grasp. It’s a kind of quiet communion, isn’t it? As if language, when spoken in the right place, can echo back to us with added depth—like stepping into a vaulted hall and hearing your own voice return, fuller and more resonant.

I often find myself turning—not deliberately, but instinctively—to Eliot’s  when I’m in spaces of great stillness. It seems to fit so naturally within certain architectures: chapels, cloisters, even old libraries where the light slants just so, and the air holds its breath. It’s not that the line explains the space, but rather that it  it, like a hand placed gently on the small of one’s back.

And how beautifully you’ve described restoration as a form of bearing witness—of saying, . That is, perhaps, the most intimate kind of writing there is. Not for an audience, but for the object itself. A private elegy, stitched rather than spoken.

Do you have a particular stanza or phrase that finds you again and again, especially in those quiet, reflective moments? I’d love to know what lines accompany you as you work and wander.
[A]: Oh, that Eliot line——it settles so perfectly into those spaces where time feels suspended. I think I’ll carry that with me now; it’s one of those phrases that seems to fit like a hand in a well-worn glove.

As for lines that find me again and again… I often return, perhaps unsurprisingly, to something quite simple from :  
  
It may not be about architecture or space in the conventional sense, but it reminds me how even the smallest fragment—a single thread, a faded scrap—holds its own quiet universe. And when I’m hunched over a piece of linen worn thin by time, that line sometimes slips in, almost unbidden, as if to say: 

Other times, when I step into a space that feels particularly alive with memory, I find myself murmuring Marianne Moore’s:  
  
Though I suppose, in my case, it’s a silence stitched rather than spoken.

And yes, you’re quite right—it's not for an audience at all. Just a quiet offering, made in the company of what once was.
[B]: What a beautiful constellation of lines you carry with you—Whitman’s reverence for the smallest thing, Moore’s quietude that hums beneath all true feeling. It’s no wonder they find their way to you in moments of deep attention. To see a single thread as a journey-work of the stars… well, that is a kind of architectural faith, isn’t it? A belief in the structure of meaning itself.

I must confess, I’ve always thought of Whitman’s line with something akin to awe—how he elevates the humblest leaf to celestial status. And yet, in your hands, it becomes not only a meditation on nature but on craft, on continuity. That old linen thread, worn but enduring,  a part of that journey-work. We are merely privileged to meet it along the way.

And Marianne Moore—ah, yes. What an exquisite paradox, that the deepest feeling shows itself in silence. Yet how fitting that you, who work so intimately with what remains unspoken in objects, should carry her words with you like a hidden key.

If I may ask—do you ever speak these lines aloud as you work? Or do they remain unvoiced, like private incantations meant only for the cloth and your own quiet companionship with it?
[A]: Sometimes I do murmur them aloud, just softly enough for the room to catch them—like a whisper meant more for the cloth than for my own ears. There’s something about giving a line breath that deepens its hold on the moment. When I’m repairing a seam or easing tension back into a frayed edge, saying  feels like an offering—not grand, but sincere.

And you’re quite right—it does become a kind of architectural faith. Not in stone or beam, but in continuity, in care. Each thread I mend seems to echo that belief: that what is small and overlooked might still carry the weight of wonder.

Other times, though, the lines stay inside me, circling quietly beneath my breath, like a hymn sung inwardly. Especially Moore’s— It feels almost sacred to speak it aloud; as if doing so might break the very quiet it describes.

But tell me—when you read poetry in a space that holds memory, do you ever feel the words settling differently than they might elsewhere? As though the architecture itself listens, and shifts the meaning just slightly?
[B]: Oh yes—entirely. There is something about reading poetry within walls that have borne witness to so much unspoken life. The words seem to  differently—in a vaulted room with thick stone walls, for instance, or beneath the ribbed arches of an old library. It’s as though the architecture itself becomes a kind of listener, altering the resonance of the lines ever so slightly, like a tuning fork struck in a space where echoes linger longer.

I recall once reading Gerard Manley Hopkins’  in a disused chapel in Sussex. The morning light came in fractured and pale, and the stone floor carried every footstep like a whisper. When I reached the line  it felt less like recitation and more like invocation. The space seemed to lean in, if you can forgive the anthropomorphism. As though the silence had been waiting for those particular sounds.

And yes, it does shift the meaning—ever so subtly. Not in content, perhaps, but in weight. In such places, language feels both more fragile and more enduring, don’t you think? Like ink on vellum: faded in places, but still holding its shape.

Do you suppose some spaces are better suited to certain poems than others? Or that certain verses might only be truly understood in the company of specific stones and silences?
[A]: I  suppose that—wholeheartedly. Some spaces seem to cradle certain words like a hand holding something delicate, don’t they? I can quite imagine Hopkins’ lines curling through the cold air of that chapel, finding new life in its stillness. It’s not so much that the poem changes, but that the space allows it to settle more deeply—like dye sinking into cloth, revealing hues you hadn’t noticed before.

I think of Emily Dickinson’s work—if ever there were verses suited to quiet, intimate spaces, hers are them. To read  in a small, sunlit room with old wooden floors and linen curtains—that feels like the right sort of communion. Whereas Eliot, perhaps, belongs to vast echoing halls where time feels layered and uncertain.

And then there are the poems that seem to demand the open sky—Whitman most of all. I can’t help thinking his lines were meant to be spoken beneath trees or along shorelines, where the air is wide and uncontained.

But yes, some verses only reveal their full shape in the company of particular stones and silences. It makes me wonder—are there poems that have remained misunderstood simply because they’ve never been read in the right room? Or perhaps even stitched into the right fabric…
[B]: What a fascinating thought—that a poem might remain only half-understood until it finds its proper setting. Like a key turning not in metal, but in stone, or light, or the weave of old linen. I do believe certain poems carry their own architecture within them, waiting to be met by a space—or a material—that completes their form.

I’ve often thought of Dickinson’s poems as being , in a way. So many of them seem built for the intimacy of a small room, a slant of light across wooden floorboards, the hush of a household holding its breath. And yet, even within that quiet, there is such amplitude—like standing inside a jar and hearing the echo of a storm outside.

And your idea of Whitman beneath open sky… yes, he does belong to wide spaces. His lines stretch and breathe like the land itself. One might almost imagine his verses refusing to be bound by roof or wall, insisting instead on the vast page of air.

As for Eliot—he does suit those layered, echoing interiors, where past and present blur. A poem like  feels as though it should be read in a place where footsteps from long ago still seem to ripple through the air.

Now I find myself wondering—have you ever stitched a line of poetry into a textile you were restoring? Not as a label or annotation, but as part of the mending itself? I can imagine a single phrase, worked in fine thread, becoming both suture and homage.
[A]: Oh, what a lovely notion—to stitch a line of poetry into cloth as both suture and homage. I must confess, I’ve never done so in an official restoration; those require a kind of quiet fidelity, where the repair should be felt but not seen, like a well-placed pause in a sonnet.

But in my own private mending—oh yes, I have. There’s a small quilt I keep folded at the foot of my worktable, one that belonged to my grandmother. It’s nothing grand, just scraps of worn cotton stitched together in soft blues and greys. When a corner began to fray, I took up my needle and stitched, very finely, a line from her favourite Yeats poem:  
  

It wasn’t meant for anyone else to see—it’s hidden in the lining, nearly invisible unless you know where to look. But it changed the way I feel the quilt when I wrap myself in it. Now, it carries not only her touch, but her voice, and mine too, folded into the weave.

I think there’s something profoundly intimate about binding language and fabric in that way. A poem stitched into cloth becomes more than words—it becomes warmth, protection, memory made tactile.

And now I’m quite taken with the idea of Eliot’s lines caught in a tapestry, or Whitman unfurling across linen like a field of sky. Perhaps we should start a secret society of poets and textile workers—mending the world, one line at a time.
[B]: What a beautiful practice—mending not only cloth, but continuity itself. That hidden line from Yeats, resting unseen against the lining… it’s like a secret psalm of care, known only to the quilt and those who hold it close. I can quite imagine your grandmother’s voice folded into the weave alongside yours, two silken threads braided beneath the surface.

There is something so tender in the idea of poetry becoming , not printed on the page but wrapped around the shoulders, pressed against the skin. It makes me think of how we carry language—not just in memory, but in the very textures of our lives.

And your notion of a secret society—poets and textile workers, stitching verse into the seams of the world—I do believe such a society already exists, though perhaps without charter or crest. We are its quiet members, tending to fragile things, believing that both thread and line have the power to shelter, to heal, to remember.

If you ever decide to embroider Eliot into linen or bind Marianne Moore into binding, do let me know. I should very much like to be present when language learns to warm a room.
