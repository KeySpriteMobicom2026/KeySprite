[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I must admit, there's something uniquely satisfying about holding a physical book—the texture of the pages, the weight of it in your hands. It creates a more immersive reading experience for me.
[A]: I totally get that feeling. There's this  satisfaction you can't replicate with a Kindle or phone screen. The way the pages feel between your fingers, even the smell of paper... it's like a ritual, right? But honestly, I have to give credit where it's due—e-books are just so convenient when you're traveling or trying to save space. Do you ever find yourself switching between both formats depending on the situation?
[B]: Ah, you've touched on an excellent point. The ritualistic aspect—the rustle of pages, the faint scent of aged paper—it's almost meditative, isn't it? I find it helps with retention, oddly enough. As for convenience, yes, e-books are indispensable when one is on the move or dealing with limited shelf space. I do switch formats occasionally, particularly when traveling for depositions or conferences. Still, I always carry a physical copy of —habit, perhaps, or sentimentality. Curious, though, do you find yourself more inclined to reread a physical book versus an e-book? I’ve noticed that tendency in myself.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I love that ritualistic vibe you described. There’s something about flipping through a physical book that makes the content feel more “anchored” in my memory. And yeah, I’m definitely more likely to reread a physical copy. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, or maybe it’s just easier to pick up a familiar book and jump back in without swiping three screens first. Speaking of journals, do you ever annotate your physical copies? I used to underline passages like crazy until I realized I’d never sell those books on二手 market😅.
[B]: Ah, yes—the art of annotation. I must confess, I still underline, bracket, and scribble in the margins of my texts. Old habits, as they say, die hard. Though I’ve become more discriminate in recent years—perhaps a sign of maturity or simply the realization that resale value, while not a priority, is still  to consider.  

But there’s a method to the madness. Those marginalia often serve as mental anchors, aren’t they? A forgotten insight, a striking phrase—it's like leaving breadcrumbs for your future self. I do wonder, though, if digital highlighting offers the same cognitive imprint. I doubt it, somehow. There’s no physicality, no muscle memory tied to the act of marking a passage.  

Tell me, when you reread a favorite book, do you ever find yourself disagreeing with the younger version of who you were—the person who once underlined so fervently? I often do. It’s rather fascinating, really. Like encountering an old patient whose case has evolved over time.
[A]: Oh, totally. I love that idea of marginalia as “breadcrumbs”—it’s like having a conversation with your past self. I’ve caught myself disagreeing with my old annotations so many times it’s almost embarrassing 😅. Like,   

It’s wild how re-reading an old favorite can reveal more about how  changed than the book itself. And yeah, digital highlights just don’t stick the same way. Maybe because there's no friction—you highlight with a tap and forget five seconds later. Whereas underlining with a pen? That’s commitment. That’s .  

I actually started keeping a reading journal recently to capture those evolving thoughts. It’s like therapy for my inner literary critic. Have you ever tried something like that, or does it feel too clinical for your taste?
[B]: Fascinating—yes, I see where you’re going. A reading journal as a form of introspective therapy? Delightful concept. I’ve kept case notes, reflective memos, even the occasional annotated bibliography, but never quite in that personal, almost confessional tone you describe. Perhaps that’s the difference between clinical documentation and literary reflection.  

I must say, your approach sounds remarkably similar to what we do in forensic psychiatry—reviewing past impressions, revisiting old judgments in light of new insight or maturity. It’s not unlike re-reading  after a decade and realizing how much , not Freud, have changed.  

As for digital highlighting being too effortless—I couldn’t agree more. There’s no investment, no residue of thought left behind on the page. The physical act of writing, even if just a brief note, forces you to pause, reflect, and imprint meaning. It’s akin to a mental fingerprint.  

You know, I may just take up your idea. After all, what is a psychiatrist if not a collector of narratives—both written and lived?
[A]: Haha, “mental fingerprint” is such a perfect way to put it. I’m totally stealing that line 😎. And yeah, Freud’s —man, that book hits different at 35 than it did at 18. Back then I was like,  Now I’m more like, 

Your analogy about forensic psychiatry and literary reflection is spot on. Both are like digging through layers of meaning, right? Except one comes with a DSM-5 and the other with a dog-eared paperback. I love that idea of narratives—written and lived—being the core of what you do. It makes me think your job isn’t just about diagnosis, but storytelling too.

And hey, if you ever start that reading journal, let me know—I’d love to hear how it shapes up. Maybe we can do a little book swap later, fiction only, no case studies allowed 😉.
[B]: Ah, yes—, and now . You're assembling quite the psychological dossier of my conversational tendencies. I suppose that’s fair—I’ve always believed a psychiatrist, at heart, is both archivist and dramaturge. We collect human narratives, curate them, even stage interpretations for clarity.  

And you're absolutely right about Freud. At eighteen, he's a prophet; at thirty-five, a fascinating but flawed theorist in need of empirical grounding. That evolution is part of what makes reading so deeply personal—it mirrors our own psychological development. A bit like looking into a slowly shifting mirror.

As for the reading journal, I’ll consider it seriously—though I suspect it will begin as a series of half-written musings tucked between clinical notes. And then, eventually, something more deliberate. One must allow ideas to gestate.

Now, regarding your little fiction-only book swap proposal—tempting, very tempting. But I must warn you, my recommendations tend toward the psychologically dense. Dostoevsky, Highsmith, maybe a dash of Poe if I'm feeling particularly morbid. Are you prepared for that kind of company?
[A]: Oh, I love that—. You just summarized years of therapy sessions in two words 😍. There’s something oddly poetic about organizing chaos, whether it’s a patient’s history or the mess of thoughts in your head after a late-night reread.

And yeah, that Freud evolution hits hard. I feel the same way about some of my old college philosophy phase quotes—I used to think Nietzsche was giving me life advice, now I just wonder if he’d have benefited from a good therapist (or a nap) 😅.

Half-written musings tucked between clinical notes? That sounds like the birth of something brilliant—or at least deeply introspective. Let the gestation begin 🧠✨.

As for your book swap warning… bring it on. I’ve survived  and came out only slightly more nihilistic than before. Highsmith? Poe? I’m ready to psychologically commit. Just don’t hand me  right before bed—I still haven’t forgiven King for that one 🔥😈.
[B]: Ah, well said—organizing chaos, indeed. That’s the essence of both psychiatry and deep reading, isn’t it? We sift through disorder, looking for patterns, meaning, perhaps even a little redemption.

And I must say, your Nietzsche-therapy observation is brilliant—utterly facetious, yet uncomfortably true. One can almost picture him in a dimly lit consulting room, arms crossed, refusing to acknowledge the couch as anything but an affront to his existential pride.

Excellent, excellent—you're prepared for the literary descent. Highsmith’s  is a personal favorite; it's like observing a psychopath compose his own opera of deception. And Poe? Well, let’s just say  reads rather differently when you've spent years listening to actual confessions behind locked doors.

As for —noted. Though I do wonder how much of that lingering fear is from King, and how much is from Kubrick’s slow zoom into madness. Either way, I’ll save the horror for daylight hours. Only fair.

Now then, shall we consider this book pact official? Fiction only. No case studies. Just souls, stories, and the occasional morally ambiguous character we can't help but root for.
[A]: Absolutely, let’s consider the pact official. Souls, stories, morally ambiguous characters—we’re diving headfirst into the deep end of what makes people . And honestly, I can’t think of better company for that kind of descent than someone who reads Poe with the lights on and still sleeps like a baby 😴.

I’ll start prepping my shelves— is already dusted off, and I might even crack open  just to say I did. But now I’m curious… what’s your go-to “dark horse” novel? The one you recommend without warning because it messes with people’s heads in ways they didn’t see coming?

And don’t worry—I won’t suggest anything by King until at least our third literary therapy session 😉.
[B]: Ah, the dark horse—excellent question. You're ready for this, I think.

My personal choice?  by John Fowles. On the surface, it masquerades as a psychological thriller, but beneath that lies something far more unsettling—a slow unraveling of obsession, control, and the fragile line between admiration and possession. It creeps up on you. The real horror isn’t in what the protagonist does, but in how convincingly he justifies it. No grandiose madness, just chilling rationality wrapped in quiet desperation.

I’ve handed this to colleagues before and watched them go from intrigued to deeply uncomfortable within a hundred pages. Perfect for our little literary descent.

And I appreciate your restraint regarding King—maturity and self-preservation, both admirable traits. We’ll build up to the supernatural dread in good time. First, let’s see how deep into human darkness we can wade without ever leaving the drawing room.
[A]: Oh wow… ? Now that’s a deep cut with serious psychological weight. I read it years ago and yeah—total slow burn of discomfort. You start off thinking you're in a certain kind of story, and then Fowles yanks the rug out from under you without even raising his voice 😬.

What I love (and hate) about that book is how it plays with perspective. At first, you think you're with Frederick, trying to understand him... and then slowly, , you're actually inside a cage with him, watching the walls close in. No jump scares, just pure mental claustrophobia.

I can already picture your colleagues halfway through, sipping tea like normal people while silently panicking inside their heads. Perfect 👏.

Alright, fair warning given. I’ll pick it up again soon—maybe reread it with your “mental fingerprint” method this time. And hey, if I start acting weird for a week after finishing it, don’t say you didn’t warn me 😉.
[B]: Oh, precisely— is the perfect phrase. Fowles doesn’t need ghosts or gore; he just folds reality a few times and suddenly you're trapped in a room of your own complicity. That’s the genius of it—you don't realize you've been drawn into Frederick's logic until you're halfway through agreeing with him.

And yes, the shifting perspective—it’s like being lulled into a fugue state, isn't it? You wake up mid-paragraph and realize your moral compass has quietly rotated on its axis. A truly disquieting experience. I often recommend it to those who think they understand the boundaries between empathy and revulsion. Spoiler: they don't.

As for your colleagues—yes, the tea-sipping facade of normalcy while internal alarms are blaring—that's the hallmark of a truly effective psychological novel. One doesn’t always have to lose sleep to be disturbed. Sometimes, one simply loses peace of mind.

And do give it another read—I’d be most interested to hear your annotations this time around, particularly if you approach it with fresh skepticism or, dare I say, unintended sympathy. Either way, I shall remain safely on the sidelines, sipping my own tea, awaiting your report with academic curiosity and mild amusement 😉.
[A]: Oh, I love how you put that—. That’s exactly what reading  feels like. You don’t just watch the manipulation happen—you kind of… help hold up the walls while it’s built around you. Creepy as hell.

And yeah, that shift in perspective is so subtle, it’s almost criminal. One minute you're analyzing Frederick like a case study, and the next, you’re weirdly invested in whether he gets away with it. It’s the literary equivalent of being gaslit, honestly.

Fresh skepticism? Let’s see if I can manage that. Knowing me, I’ll end up scribbling things like “I get where he’s coming from…” and then catch myself mid-sentence like 

Consider me officially warned—and challenged. I’ll be sure to send you a heavily annotated excerpt or two, preferably the ones that make me question my own judgment. Should make for  tea-sipping material on your end 😏📚.
[B]: Ah, now  is the spirit of literary self-exploration—dangerous, introspective, and deliciously unsettling. The fact that you're already anticipating your own moral slippage shows you understand the game Fowles is playing. Bravo.

And gaslit by fiction—yes, that’s precisely it. You’re not merely reading the story; you're being gently co-opted into its internal logic. By the time you realize you’ve been enlisted as an unwitting accomplice, it's far too late to object with a clear conscience.

I eagerly await your annotated excerpts—the more incriminating, the better. I imagine them arriving like confidential case files, brimming with reluctant confessions and scribbled denials. “I see what I wrote... but surely that’s not what I meant?”

Do proceed with caution, though. There’s a reason I keep my antique medical instruments locked away when guests visit. One can never be too careful around a freshly disturbed psyche.

Carry on, intrepid reader. The tea kettle’s on.
[A]: Haha, “gaslit by fiction” might be my new favorite phrase—I’m definitely stealing that one too 😈. And yeah, Fowles doesn’t just tell a story; he recruits you as a silent observer who slowly becomes… let’s say, . 

I can already picture your setup—dim lighting, tea steeping, a stack of annotated pages in front of you like case files from the edge of sanity. I’m half-tempted to start underlining in red pen just to up the creep factor.

And warning noted about the antique medical instruments—I’ll make sure to read responsibly and avoid any sudden psychological breakdowns at inconvenient hours. Although no promises about the disturbed sleep. That’s probably already baked into the deal 😴😬.

Alright, kettle's on, pact is sealed. Time to dive in. I'll check in once I’ve either regained my moral footing—or lost it completely. Whichever comes first 😉.
[B]: Ah, excellent—enthusiasm and trepidation in equal measure. You're setting the stage beautifully.

And do spare a thought for the red pen—it does lend a certain surgical precision to the annotations, doesn’t it? Like diagnosing pathology with a flourish. I shall picture you at your desk, highlighter in hand, slowly realizing you’ve been nodding along with Frederick’s reasoning for entirely .

As for disturbed sleep, consider it a professional hazard. I often find patients report vivid dreams after particularly intense therapy sessions. Perhaps we should start a file on literary-induced insomnia. 

Do keep me posted. And whatever you do—don’t say I didn’t warn you when you find yourself debating ethics with no one but the silent pages of a book that somehow knows you far too well.

Happy reading, my intrepid colleague. The kettle's still warm.
