[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the recent discovery of that exoplanet with potential biosignatures certainly piqued my interest. Though I must say, after decades in quantum computing, I've learned to temper my excitement with healthy skepticism. The data from the James Webb telescope is fascinating, but we'll need more observations to confirm.
[A]: Interesting perspective~ 说到James Webb的数据，让我想起最近看的一个space tech startup的pitch deck。他们正在developing新的spectral analysis算法，potential market size相当可观。Have you looked into any space-related investment opportunities?
[B]:  After seeing one too many quantum computing startups crash and burn during my Silicon Valley days, I've developed a rather... measured approach to space tech investments. That said, the spectral analysis field does show promise - reminds me of the early days of quantum algorithm development.
[A]: Haha 我懂你的concern~ 不过我们fund最近投了个很有意思的satellite data analytics公司，他们的revenue model相当solid。 说到这个，你知道space sector的valuation multiples现在是多少吗？
[B]:  Valuation multiples? Now that's a dangerous game. I recall when quantum computing companies were trading at 50x revenue - and look how that turned out. Though I must admit, the satellite data space does have more tangible applications than some of the quantum hype we saw. Still, I'd want to see their actual P&L statements before getting excited.
[A]: Exactly~ 所以我们做了很thorough的due diligence。 他们的recurring revenue growth rate保持在35% YoY，而且customer retention rate超过90%。不过你说得对，space sector确实需要更conservative的valuation approach。
[B]: Precisely. Those metrics do sound promising - reminds me of the early cloud computing days. Though may I suggest cross-referencing their churn rates with satellite lifespan projections? In my experience, hardware constraints often get overlooked in these rosy software projections. 
[A]: Good point! 我们确实把satellite replacement cycle纳入了financial model。 你看这个scenario analysis，即使考虑20%的cost overrun，IRR仍然能达到我们的hurdle rate。不过space确实是个high-risk high-return的game😅
[B]: Ah, now that's the kind of thorough analysis I appreciate. Though may I offer one final thought from an old quantum hand? Always model for at least one complete market cycle. The space between hype and reality can be... astronomical. 
[A]: Wise words my friend~  敬你的prudence! 这让我想起Warren Buffett那句名言：只有当潮水退去，才知道谁在裸泳。在space investment这个领域尤其适用。Cheers! 🍷
[B]:  To prudent investing and keeping our swimsuits firmly on. Though I must say, watching this new space race unfold is almost as entertaining as rereading Asimov's Foundation series. Almost. 
[A]: Haha 说到Foundation，最近那个space mining startup的founder简直把自己当成了Hari Seldon 😂 不过说真的，asteroid mining的economics现在看起来比quantum computing靠谱多了~  哦，我得去赶下一个meeting了
[B]:  Well, at least asteroid mining deals with actual physical matter - unlike some of the quantum vaporware I've seen. Good luck with your meeting, and do send over that due diligence report if you get a chance. Always happy to poke holes in financial models - it's practically a retirement hobby.
[A]: Will do!  下次golf的时候我们可以继续debate space vs quantum的投资thesis。BTW你最近handicap进步了吗？我的short game需要些advice~ ⛳
[B]: Ah, golf - the only arena where my quantum mechanics knowledge is completely useless. My handicap's stuck at 18, much like quantum error correction rates were in the 90s. But I'd be happy to share what little wisdom I have... after you share those financial models, of course. 
[A]: Deal!  看来我们达成了mutually beneficial arrangement。Golf wisdom换due diligence insights~ 下周same time at the clubhouse? 🏌️♂️
[B]: Splendid. I'll bring my 7-iron and my skepticism in equal measure. Just don't expect my short game advice to be any more reliable than those quantum supremacy claims were. Until then,  keep your valuations grounded.
[A]: Haha touché!  我会记住你的advice - 就像记住never to invest in cold fusion一样深刻 😂 See you at the 19th hole! 🍸
[B]:  At least the 19th hole's physics are reliably Newtonian. Looking forward to it - and do bring your A-game. Both for golf and for defending those space tech valuations. Cheers.
