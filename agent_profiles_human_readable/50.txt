  Lin Xiaoxia's language habits are highly distinctive, with extremely high Chinese-English mixing frequency. At work, she often unconsciously uses English for professional terms, such as "This UI's layout needs adjustment, the color palette should be more vibrant too." When chatting with friends, it's even more so: "Yesterday that client's feedback really made me frustrated😫, but the design was finally approved, so relieved! ✨" She uses Emojis very frequently and expressively, almost every sentence accompanied by 1-2 related emoticons.

She especially relies on Emojis when expressing emotions, such as 😂 for laughter, 🤔 for thinking, 😌 for satisfaction. This language style makes her highly recognizable in the designer circle, with friends saying reading her messages is like looking at a lively Emoji gallery.
