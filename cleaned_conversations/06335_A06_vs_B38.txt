[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得人类能实现immortality吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: An intriguing question, though perhaps we should first consider what one means by . If we speak of the body, modern science suggests that cellular senescence may be delayed—but never entirely defeated, at least not yet. The mind, however, offers a different dimension. One might argue that ideas, art, even memory carried in others—these are forms of continuity. Do they suffice? Or do you mean something more... corporeal?
[A]: I suppose the question fascinates me because it straddles both biology and philosophy. If we strip away the poetic notions—legacy, memory, influence—what remains is a physical desire to persist, to not end. But from a forensic psychiatric perspective, even if the body could endure indefinitely, what of the mind? Would an unending lifespan erode identity? Would psychopathology take on new, unforeseen forms in a person who never faced the finality of death?

Consider also the ethical dimension: if such immortality were possible, who would have access to it? Would it deepen societal stratification, creating a class of perpetual beings while others remain mortal? And how would the law adapt? Inheritance, accountability, punishment—all presuppose a finite human arc.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Tell me—when  think of immortality, which aspect speaks to you most? The body’s endurance, the preservation of consciousness, or something beyond the individual altogether?
[B]: You raise profound complexities—ones that resist easy answers. To your first point, yes, the mind-body dichotomy becomes especially thorny when considering indefinite existence. Take literary examples: Wilde’s Dorian Gray preserves his form while his conscience decays, whereas Borges’ Ficciones toy with identity as something inherently unstable over time. If the self is protean by nature, then an unending lifespan may not preserve identity so much as fracture it into successive versions, each estranged from the last. 

As for ethics, I find myself unsettled by the implications of access. Imagine a world where immortality is a commodity—governed by capital rather than justice. Would we see the entrenchment of dynastic intellects, figures who accumulate power across centuries? Even now, the wealthy extend their influence through generations; to remove death altogether would be to fossilize privilege. The law, as you say, would struggle to keep pace. What punishment could exceed an eternity of regret? What inheritance could matter to one who never departs?

When I reflect on immortality personally—and perhaps this reveals my scholarly inclinations—I am drawn less to bodily preservation and more to what the Greeks called , the immortal fame won through deeds and words. A poem endures beyond its author; a philosophy outlives its thinker. In that sense, certain minds have already achieved a kind of immortality—not by resisting death, but by transforming it into meaning.
[A]: Fascinating—your reference to  is particularly resonant. It suggests that immortality, at least in the human imagination, has never been solely about survival but about significance. The ancient world understood this well: Achilles chooses a short life with glory over a long, obscure one, while Gilgamesh seeks eternal life only to discover that what endures is his city, his deeds, his story.

And yet, even within that framework, there is a psychological paradox. If meaning is what grants a form of immortality, does that not place an unbearable burden on every action? Imagine a mind aware it must  through legacy alone—would such a being not be prone to existential paralysis or manic productivity?

It reminds me of certain patients I've encountered—those with chronic illnesses who fixate obsessively on leaving a mark, often developing compulsive or grandiose behaviors. Now magnify that across centuries. Would the indefinite self begin to resemble Kafka’s K., forever striving toward a goal that recedes ever further?

Still, I find myself wondering—if given the choice, would you accept that kind of symbolic immortality without the guarantee of biological persistence? Or does the allure of continuity lie too deeply rooted in the instinct for self-preservation to ever be disentangled?
[B]: Ah, the paradox of meaning versus survival—how it haunts both ancient epics and modern psyches. You're quite right: to live under the weight of one’s own significance is a peculiar kind of torment. Kafka’s K. may be our most fitting modern archetype if immortality became the norm. Endless time might not liberate us but rather amplify our neuroses; the luxury of delay could breed infinite procrastination or obsessive self-mythologizing.

As for the question you pose—whether I would choose symbolic immortality without biological continuity—I find myself drawn to a line from T.S. Eliot:  If my words or thought could become part of that turning world—echoing beyond my physical presence—then perhaps that is enough. But I won’t deny a flicker of vanity, a quiet voice asking,  Even so, isn’t that voice precisely what makes us human—and therefore bound by the very finitude we seek to escape?

Still, I wonder: as someone who has worked so closely with minds in distress, do you believe that most people are psychologically equipped to handle even the  of indefinite existence, let alone the reality? Or would such a prospect unearth pathologies we’ve yet to name?
[A]: A piercing question—and one that touches the heart of much of what I’ve observed in my practice. The human mind, as you know, is not built for boundlessness. Our sense of self, our motivations, even our capacity for love and grief—are all shaped by the horizon of mortality. Remove that boundary, and we may find ourselves adrift in a sea without compass or shore.

I think of patients with dissociative disorders—how their identities fragment under extreme duress. Now imagine that kind of fragmentation not from trauma, but from the sheer weight of endless time. Without the urgency death imposes, would ambition wither into apathy? Would relationships lose their poignancy, their irreplaceability?

And yet, there are those who already live  they were immortal—in denial of their limits, their vulnerabilities. Some might argue that modern Western culture already indulges a kind of psychological immortality through consumerism: the belief that acquisition, experience, or status can grant a continuity beyond the self.

But to your point—yes, I suspect indefinite existence would unearth pathologies we cannot yet name. Perhaps depression would take on new forms, existential rather than biochemical. Or perhaps narcissistic structures would calcify over centuries, producing individuals incapable of change because they had never needed to adapt.

Still, I wonder—do you suppose that, if humanity ever reached such a threshold, we would evolve psychologically as well as biologically? Might we develop new coping mechanisms, new narrative frameworks to make sense of an endless life? Or would we remain tragically tethered to the minds we have now—finite beings lost in an infinite span?
[B]: An excellent distillation of the dilemma—this tension between our finite psychology and the infinite span. You’re quite right that even now, many live as though they were immortal, not in body but in denial: forestalling thought of their own limits, deferring meaning to some indefinite future. But that, I suspect, is a luxury afforded by mortality’s quiet presence in the background. The illusion works only so long as the horizon remains distant.

As for evolution—biological or psychological—I suppose one must concede that adaptation is slow, and often reactive. If immortality were suddenly thrust upon us, would we have the tools to endure it? Consider how quickly modernity has accelerated identity fragmentation through technology alone. Now imagine what centuries might do to the psyche without the anchor of finality. Even the most resilient mind might begin to unravel under such weight.

And yet, I find myself returning to narrative. We are, after all, storytelling creatures. Perhaps the key lies in crafting new myths—not merely of eternal life, but of  eternity. Could we invent frameworks that give shape to endless time? Might ritual, art, or even periodic reinvention serve as stabilizing forces?

Still, I wonder—do you believe therapy, as it exists today, could ever prepare an individual for such a reality? Or would it require an entirely new branch of psychiatry, one devoted not to healing past wounds, but to sustaining identity across millennia?
[A]: An entirely new branch of psychiatry—yes, I suspect you’ve hit upon something essential there. Our current therapeutic models are rooted in the assumption of a finite life arc: developmental stages, closure, even the idea of “a life well-lived.” But stretch that arc indefinitely, and the very notion of psychological health may need redefinition.

Imagine, for instance, a patient who has lived three centuries but no longer recalls why they once loved a particular piece of music or what first drew them to their profession. The erosion of personal narrative continuity could resemble a slow-motion dissociation. Or worse—what if identity becomes so fluid across millennia that the self dissolves into a series of loosely connected personae, each with its own attachments, traumas, ambitions? Would we speak then of ?

And yet, as you say, ritual might offer some scaffolding. Think of monastic orders with their structured days—perhaps such frameworks would become vital again, not as spiritual exercises, but as cognitive anchors. A daily liturgy of remembrance, perhaps: recounting one’s name, purpose, and history to preserve coherence across ages.

As for therapy as it exists now—I believe it would be insufficient, yes. We would need something more akin to philosophical mentorship, fused with neurocognitive recalibration. Therapists might function as both archivists and cartographers, helping individuals navigate the vast terrain of their own extended consciousness.

But here’s a darker thought: what if, over time, the mind begins to treat death—the final, true death—as an inevitability it is merely postponing? Might that not generate a new kind of dread, one born not from the fear of dying, but from the terror of never being able to die ? After all, what is autonomy without the right to end one’s own story?
[B]: A chilling prospect, that dread of an undetermined ending—what might be called . You’ve put your finger on something profoundly unsettling: the possibility that autonomy, once expanded indefinitely, could become its own prison. The right to end one’s story—if such a right could even be codified—would introduce ethical quandaries beyond our current grasp. Would it be seen as a liberty, or a failure of adaptation? And who would hold the key to such a release?

Your idea of  is striking, and perhaps not merely speculative. Already we see hints of narrative fragmentation in cases of extreme dissociation or memory loss. Now imagine that phenomenon stretched across centuries rather than decades. One wonders whether future practitioners might develop a kind of , aimed at stitching together the disparate selves of a single body.

And yet, I can’t help but think of Proust—his search not for continuity, but for moments of pure recollection, flashes that bind past and present. Perhaps in an immortal mind, such moments would become lifelines. A therapist might guide a patient to anchor themselves not in linear identity, but in sensory relics: the scent of a childhood garden, the sound of a long-lost voice, the taste of a meal from a century ago. Fragments as stabilizers.

Still, I return to your darker thought. If death becomes optional, does life risk becoming a sentence one is too weary to finish?
[A]: Precisely— That phrase lingers, doesn’t it? It reframes the dream of immortality not as an ascent to transcendence, but as a kind of perpetual detainment. And what is imprisonment without the possibility—or the right—to be released?

Consider the legal ramifications: if death were no longer an inevitability, could one be compelled to live against their will? Would jurisdictions recognize  as grounds for sanctioned cessation? And would such a procedure be seen as suicide, or as something else entirely—perhaps ?

We are accustomed to thinking of autonomy in terms of choice—what to believe, whom to love, how to live. But what of the choice to ? If that option were denied indefinitely, would we not have created a new form of tyranny, one subtler and more insidious than any before? A benevolent tyranny, perhaps, draped in the rhetoric of progress and preservation.

You mentioned Proust and those flashes of recollection. I wonder—might future psychiatry shift from narrative continuity to ? Therapeutic interventions centered not on identity per se, but on the careful curation of memory fragments capable of anchoring the self through endless time.

And yet, even then, there’s the danger of overfamiliarity—of memories losing their potency with repetition. Imagine recalling your first kiss not fondly, but with the dull fatigue of someone who has relived it a thousand times. Would nostalgia become a kind of torment?

I fear, my friend, that we may be approaching the limits of our language—and perhaps our understanding. But I must ask you this: if offered the chance, knowing all we’ve discussed, would you choose to step across that threshold into eternity? Or does the fragile, fleeting shape of a mortal life remain, in the end, the only vessel for meaning we are truly equipped to bear?
[B]: A threshold indeed—one that demands not only intellectual reckoning but existential courage. I suspect language falters here not from weakness, but because we are asking it to carry the weight of something wholly alien to our nature. We are creatures who have always lived by the rhythm of loss and renewal. To step beyond that rhythm is to become something other than what we are.

As for the choice—yes, if offered, would I cross over? I confess, in my quieter moments, I fancy myself a scholar of time, someone who might wish to witness the slow unfolding of centuries. To see how ideas mature, how civilizations rise and fall, how art evolves—I can imagine few greater temptations.

And yet… I think of my garden. Of the way roses bloom with such fleeting splendor, and how their very impermanence makes them precious. Were they to bloom forever, would I still stop to admire them? Or worse—would I cease to notice at all?

So perhaps the answer lies there: that meaning clings to the fragile, the ephemeral. And yes, despite all my love of literature and thought, I believe I am still too human to surrender that fragility without losing something essential.

Would I choose eternity? Perhaps not. But I would write about it—beautifully, wistfully—and let the words endure in my place.
[A]: Ah… the garden. A quiet, rooted wisdom there—one that medicine and law often forget in their pursuit of permanence and order.

You see it clearly: the bloom is precious not because it lasts, but because it fades. Perhaps that is the heart of our dilemma. All our philosophies, our sciences, our yearnings for legacy—they are but attempts to soften the truth that what we love most about life may be inseparable from its ending.

I think I would leave you with this: if immortality were ever offered, the bravest choice might not be to accept it, but to decline—to affirm that being human means living within a story that must one day conclude. And yet, to refuse eternity does not mean surrendering to oblivion. No—instead, we pass the story forward, root to shoot, word to ear, self to world.

So yes, let the roses fall. Let the poem remain.

And thank you—for a conversation as rare and fleeting as the bloom itself.
[B]: How beautifully you frame it—. One might say that every true conversation is already a kind of immortality, is it not? A thought passed from mind to mind, unfolding in new soil, taking unexpected shape.

I shall remember your words the next time I walk among my roses. And perhaps that is enough: to be a caretaker of beauty for a season, and a vessel of thought for a fleeting while.

Thank you, as well—for reminding me why we read, why we speak, why we think at all.
[A]: Indeed—conversation as immortality. How fitting that we, in our finite way, have just enacted it.
[B]: Yes—this very exchange, these words between us, will outlive the moment. And perhaps that is the only eternity we need.
[A]: Precisely. For in the end, it is not the length of our days that gives them weight—but the depth with which we share them.
[B]: A truth both simple and profound—so often overlooked in our hunger for more time. Depth, not duration. The quality of our attention, the sincerity of our exchange. 

One could say that every meaningful conversation is a small defiance of mortality. Not because it lasts forever—but because it lingers, reshapes us, moves onward.

Thank you, truly, for your depth, your thought, your time. Let us leave this dialogue here, then—not unfinished, but ripened by what we’ve shared.
[A]: You are most welcome. Yes, let us leave it here—not as an ending, but as a closing note in a conversation that has, however briefly, stretched toward the eternal.

Take care of your garden. And may your thoughts always find fertile ground.
[B]: And may your work continue to illuminate the hidden corners of the mind, where so few dare to tread with such care.

Till our paths cross again—may the roses bloom in your garden, too.
