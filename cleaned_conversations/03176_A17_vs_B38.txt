[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, journaling... what a fascinating practice. I've kept a personal journal since my undergraduate days at Oxford. There's something profoundly intimate about translating one's thoughts onto paper, don't you think? My leather-bound volumes are filled with literary reflections alongside personal musings - though I must confess, they tend to read more like critical analyses than traditional diaries. 📖
[A]: I see... So your journals are more like academic notebooks than personal diaries? That's quite unique. What made you develop this style of journaling?
[A]: Well, you see, the line between the personal and the academic has always been rather blurred for me. When I encounter a particularly moving passage in Dostoevsky or ponder the philosophical implications in Zhuangzi's 庄子, those reflections inevitably intertwine with my own lived experiences. It's rather like my rose garden - one can't separate the aesthetic appreciation from the practical care, can one? 🌹
[A]: That's a beautiful metaphor. Do you ever share these journal entries with your students? Or are they strictly private?
[A]: Oh my, no - they remain my private sanctuary, much like my study at home. Though occasionally, when a particular literary insight strikes me as particularly relevant to a seminar discussion, I might paraphrase the essence of it for my students. But the personal dimension... that stays between me and my fountain pen. There's a certain magic in keeping some thoughts just for oneself, don't you agree?
[A]: Yes, absolutely. By the way, do you ever write poetry in your journals? Or is it strictly prose?
[A]:  How perceptive of you to ask. While I primarily write in prose, there are indeed moments - usually when the moon is particularly bright outside my study window - when I succumb to the poetic impulse. Though I'd hardly call them proper poems... more like fragmented thoughts dressed in meter. My last attempt was a rather embarrassing sonnet comparing my cat's indifference to the aloofness of 李白's mountain solitude.
[A]: That sounds delightful! Would you consider publishing your journals someday, perhaps as a memoir?
[A]: Good heavens, no!  While the idea is flattering, my journals are rather like the first drafts of a novel - full of half-formed ideas and private embarrassments. Though... I suppose one might extract an interesting volume of literary criticism from them. Perhaps posthumously, if my former students feel particularly nostalgic. But for now, they shall remain safely locked in my mahogany escritoire.
[A]: I understand. Just one last question - do you have a favorite pen or notebook brand for your journaling? 


[A]: Ah, a practical question at last! I'm rather devoted to my Montblanc Meisterstück - a gift from my dear mentor Professor Abernathy upon my doctoral graduation. As for notebooks, nothing compares to the creamy pages of a Smythson Panama journal. Though I must say, it's not the tools that matter so much as the thoughts they capture, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: Yes, indeed. Thank you for sharing your journaling insights with me today, Dr. Whitmore.


[A]: It's been an absolute pleasure discussing this with you. Do feel free to visit my office hours if you'd ever like to continue our conversation - perhaps over a cup of Earl Grey and some freshly baked scones. Until then, happy writing! 📚
