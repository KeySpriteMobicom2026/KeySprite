[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question that takes me back to my teaching days. While I appreciate the convenience of e-books - especially when traveling - there's something irreplaceable about the tactile experience of a physical book. The smell of paper, the weight in your hands... it reminds me of my first programming manuals from the 1970s. Though I must admit, my Kindle does make reading technical papers much easier these days.
[A]: Oh my dear, you've touched upon such a profound dichotomy of our modern reading experience. The scent of aged paper does indeed evoke something primal, doesn't it? Like the first time I held a first edition of Tennyson's works in the Bodleian Library. That being said, I do find e-readers wonderfully practical for carrying entire libraries when I travel to academic conferences. Though nothing quite compares to annotating margins with a fountain pen - such a meditative practice.
[B]: You've got me reminiscing now. I still have my old copy of "The Art of Computer Programming" with handwritten notes in the margins from my graduate school days. Those annotations tell a story of their own - you can see exactly where I struggled with algorithms and where breakthroughs happened. Though I will say, the search function in digital texts has saved me countless hours when consulting references. It's a trade-off between nostalgia and efficiency, isn't it?
[A]: Precisely! Your experience mirrors my own with critical editions of poetry. The marginalia create what we might call a palimpsest of intellectual growth - layer upon layer of understanding. Though I must confess, when preparing lectures, the ability to instantly search across multiple digital texts is... well, let's just say it's saved me from many a late night in the library stacks. Still, there's a certain romance to that physical hunt through pages, don't you think? Like tracking a particularly elusive metaphor through Browning's dramatic monologues.
[B]: Ah, you're speaking my language now! It reminds me of debugging old Fortran code - sometimes you had to physically flip through reams of printouts to find that one misplaced comma. The digital equivalent just doesn't provide the same... shall we say, kinesthetic learning experience. Though I wouldn't wish those days on today's students - they'd probably think we were dinosaurs!  The younger generation seems perfectly content with purely digital texts, while we old-timers cling to our paper like security blankets.
[A]:  Your analogy to debugging is rather poetic, actually. It makes me think of how my students today annotate PDFs with digital highlighters - so efficient, yet somehow lacking the... the physicality of pressing a pencil into paper until the thought takes root. Though I suppose we mustn't romanticize the past too much. After all, I do enjoy being able to enlarge the font when reading Yeats at midnight - a luxury my younger eyes never required!
[B]: You've hit upon something important there - accessibility. As someone who's watched his eyesight change over the decades, I can't deny the practical advantages of adjustable fonts and backlit screens. Though I'll always keep my favorite programming books on the shelf, even if I need a magnifying glass to read them now. It's funny how technology gives with one hand while taking away with the other, isn't it? My students get instant access to information, but perhaps miss out on that visceral connection to knowledge we old professors cherish.
[A]: How astute of you to mention accessibility - it reminds me of teaching Milton to students with visual impairments. The digital era has been nothing short of revolutionary for them. Yet...  ...I can't help but worry that something intangible is lost when one never experiences the weight of a thick anthology, or the way certain editions fall open at often-read passages. But then, as my dear colleague in the Classics department says, the ancient Greeks probably lamented the shift from scrolls to codices! Perhaps every generation must mourn its own obsolete technologies while embracing the new.
[B]: That's beautifully put. You know, I still have my first slide rule in a drawer somewhere - completely obsolete now, but it represents an entire era of computation. Our students will probably say the same about physical books one day, though I hope not too soon. The transition from print to digital reminds me of how we moved from punch cards to modern programming - the fundamentals stay the same, but the interface changes everything. Though I must say, I do enjoy seeing my grandchildren discover the magic of pop-up books. Some experiences just can't be replicated digitally, can they?
[A]: Ah, pop-up books! What a delightful example of the irreplaceable artistry of physical books. It makes me think of William Blake's illuminated manuscripts - how the marriage of text and image creates meaning in ways that transcend mere information transfer. Though I suppose our digital-native students might argue that augmented reality books offer new dimensions of interaction.  But there's a quiet dignity to turning pages that swiping simply cannot replicate, don't you think? Like the difference between a handwritten letter and a text message - both communicate, but only one feels like a gift.
[B]: Exactly! You've articulated what I've felt but couldn't quite express. It's like comparing assembly language to Python - both get the job done, but one requires you to understand the machine at a deeper level. Physical books make you work a bit harder, engage more senses, and that very effort creates a different kind of connection with the material. Though I suspect my students would roll their eyes at such sentimentalism - to them, content is content, regardless of the medium. Maybe that's the real generational divide, not the technology itself but our emotional attachment to its physical forms.
[A]: How perceptive! Your comparison to programming languages is rather inspired. It makes me think of how we literature professors fret about "close reading" becoming a lost art in the age of rapid digital consumption. Though I must admit - and this pains me to say - I've caught myself skimming on my tablet in ways I never would with a printed page. There's a lesson here about intentionality, isn't there? Like the difference between fast food and a slow, mindful meal. Perhaps what we're really mourning isn't the paper itself, but the pace and presence it demanded of us.
[B]: You've put your finger on it precisely. In my programming courses, I've noticed students who only work with high-level languages often miss understanding how the computer actually processes information. Similarly, the convenience of digital reading risks making us passive consumers rather than active engagers with text. Though I'm optimistic - just as some young programmers rediscover the value of low-level coding, perhaps future readers will come to appreciate what physical books offer. After all, vinyl records made a comeback, didn't they? Maybe we're not dinosaurs after all, just... early adopters of a retro trend!
[A]:  Oh, I do hope you're right about that! Perhaps we're witnessing not the death of print, but rather its transformation into something more... curated. Like how my students now collect special edition poetry volumes while reading everything else digitally. It reminds me of what the Japanese call 侘寂 (wabi-sabi) - finding beauty in imperfection and transience. The book as object may become rarer, but thereby more precious. Though I must say, I'm rather relieved my gardening books remain stubbornly resistant to digitization - one really needs to see those rose varieties in proper color!
[B]: Ah, technical manuals and art books - you've identified the last bastions of print! I still insist on physical copies for my computer architecture references - some things just work better when you can lay them out side by side. Though I suppose augmented reality might change even that someday. But you're absolutely right about curation - my prized possession is a first edition of Dijkstra's "A Discipline of Programming," complete with coffee stains from many late-night debugging sessions. No digital version could ever capture that history. Maybe that's what we're really preserving - not just information, but the physical evidence of our intellectual journeys.
[A]: How profoundly true. Those coffee stains are like the foxing on my well-loved copy of "The Waste Land" - each mark a testament to the lived experience of reading. It makes me think of Walter Benjamin's concept of the "aura" in mechanical reproduction. Perhaps what we're discussing is precisely that ineffable quality that resists digitization - the patina of human engagement. Though I must confess, I do enjoy showing my undergraduates how to properly break in a new book's spine. They look at me as if I'm performing some arcane ritual!  Some traditions, it seems, are worth preserving.
[B]: Indeed! Breaking in a book's spine - now there's a ritual that deserves preservation. It reminds me of teaching students how to properly handle magnetic tapes back in the day. These physical interactions create muscle memory that forms part of the learning experience. You're right about Benjamin's "aura" - my annotated Turing papers have that same quality. Though I wonder if future generations will develop their own meaningful rituals around digital objects? Maybe swiping left to bookmark will carry its own nostalgia someday. But for now, I'll keep my shelves of well-loved books - they're like old friends who always have more to teach me.
[A]: What a lovely way to put it - "old friends who always have more to teach." That reminds me of how my mentor used to say each rereading of a great text reveals new layers, like peeling an onion. Though these days, I suppose the digital natives might compare it to discovering new features in a software update!  Regardless of the medium, the important thing is that the conversation between reader and text continues. Even if my students tease me about my "antique" habits, I take comfort knowing the essence of scholarship remains unchanged - whether one turns pages or swipes screens, the pursuit of understanding endures.
[B]: Well said! At the end of the day, it's not about the medium but the ideas it carries. Like how the essence of an algorithm remains the same whether it's written in stone tablets or quantum code. Though I'll keep my dog-eared copies of Knuth's volumes - they've seen me through more all-nighters than I care to remember. And who knows? Maybe someday my students will look back fondly at their first e-readers with the same nostalgia. After all, progress doesn't erase the past - it just gives us new ways to appreciate it. Now if you'll excuse me, this conversation has inspired me to revisit some old friends on my bookshelf... with a proper cup of tea in hand.
