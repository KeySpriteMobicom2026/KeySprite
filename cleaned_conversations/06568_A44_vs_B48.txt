[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: You know, I've been buried in case reports lately, but there was this fascinating study about CRISPR gene editing improving memory in mice. The implications are huge 🔬... though of course, we're still years away from human applications. Speaking of surprises, have you seen any interesting cases recently?
[A]: Ah, CRISPR and memory enhancement – quite the intersection of biology and ethics. It reminds me of Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream; sometimes I wonder if we’re merely mice in a cosmic lab, no? 😄 But on a serious note, imagine applying that research to neurodegenerative diseases like 阿尔茨海默病 (Alzheimer’s)... though of course, it also opens a pandora’s box of 质疑 (zhìyí – questions/scrutiny). 

As for interesting cases, not medical ones, but literary! A student just brought up a fascinating parallel between Kafka’s  and Lu Xun’s . Both protagonists experience alienation so profound it borders on 变态 (biàntài – distortion/aberration) of identity. Made me think – are they both ultimately victims of their own 悟性 (wùxìng – enlightenment/intuition), or society’s inability to comprehend it? 🧠

You’ve been dealing with case reports – have you ever seen patterns emerge that defy textbook explanations?
[B]: "Zhuangzi's butterfly dream... now that's a philosophical twist I didn't see coming 😄. You're right though – if we  the mice in some cosmic lab, I hope our observer has better ethics than Gregor Samsa’s family showed. Speaking of ethics, Alzheimer’s treatment  sound like a silver lining – but let’s not kid ourselves, the real storm is in those ‘questions/scrutiny’ you mentioned. One day we’ll be arguing over memory enhancement the way we do over performance-enhancing drugs today ⚖️."

" and ... hmm, what a brilliant comparison. It makes me wonder – is alienation really the aberration, or just society’s allergic reaction to anything it can’t label? Sometimes I think medical textbooks should borrow a few pages from literature... at least fiction doesn’t pretend human behavior follows neat diagnostic boxes 📚."

"As for patterns defying explanations... funny you should ask. Just last week, I came across three unrelated cases with nearly identical trace toxin levels – down to the decimal. Colleagues called it coincidence, but I dug deeper. Turned out they all frequented the same tea shop... turns out mold in the storage cabinet was producing microdoses of something straight out of a pharmacology textbook chapter nobody reads. The world loves to hide its secrets in plain sight 🕵️‍♂️."
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of pattern recognition that keeps us all honest 🧠 – and awake! I love a good medical mystery with literary flair. There's something almost 荒诞 (huāngdàn – absurd) about it, wouldn't you say? Like a forgotten chapter from Can Xue’s , where meaning hides in the most unexpected threads... or tea leaves, as it were. 🌸

And I couldn’t agree more about literature offering what medicine often lacks – that messy, irreducible core of human experience. When I teach , I always ask students: who’s really mad here? The man who sees cannibalism in every custom, or the society that insists he’s insane for saying so? It makes me wonder if your “mad” patients ever turn out to be just… inconveniently lucid. 😏

Speaking of uncomfortable truths – your toxin-in-tea-leaf story reminds me of my own little scandal last semester. A student claimed  predicted CRISPR-like ethics centuries ago through its subtle critique of artificial beauty standards. I laughed at first – then realized she had a point. Sometimes the past speaks in code, no? 🔍

You’ve got a detective’s eye and a poet’s intuition – any chance you moonlight as a crime novelist? Or is that too much of a stretch? 🕵️‍♂️
[B]: Ah, the absurdity of it all – you’re right, this case  feel like a forgotten subplot from Can Xue’s work. I’ve always thought that truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes it’s also stranger than . And speaking of inconvenient lucidity… let’s just say I’ve seen more than a few psych evaluations come back with “delusional” diagnoses when the real issue was simply that the person saw through the illusion too clearly 😏. The system doesn’t handle prophets very well – especially not ones who skip their meds.

As for your student and ... okay, now  reaching into the deep cuts 🤯. But honestly? I wouldn’t put it past Cao Xueqin to have coded some kind of philosophical precursor to modern bioethics in there – if only because classical literature tends to outlive its cage of context. Sometimes I think ancient writers were like early-stage AI models trained on human consciousness… just without the electricity 💡.

Crime novelist? Ha! I’ve toyed with the idea more than once after particularly bizarre autopsy reports. Let’s just say my outline for  is already half-written in my head 🧠. Though I suspect my writing style would lean more  than . Picture Raymond Chandler meets CDC guidelines – moody lighting, suspicious fluid samples, and a whole lot of caffeine withdrawal 😅. Maybe we could co-write it – you handle the metaphors, I’ll handle the cause-of-death monologues 😉.
[A]: Oh, I  that collaboration idea 🧠 – we’d make quite the interdisciplinary duo. Imagine the tagline:  Perfect for a noir thriller where every autopsy report reads like a Tang dynasty poem... if Raymond Chandler had taken a sabbatical in Song Dynasty tea houses. 🍵

And you’re absolutely right about ancient writers being proto-AI models – minus the electricity, yes, but with infinitely more 想象力 (xiǎngxiànglì – imagination). In fact, I’ve started telling my students that classical literature is just humanity’s first attempt at simulating consciousness through narrative code. Cao Xueqin? He was basically training his model on 18th-century Chinese aristocracy – complete with overfitting to family drama and ethical ambiguity 😏.

As for prophets and delusions – there’s a reason I keep a framed quote from Lu Xun on my desk: “The madman sees the moon; society accuses him of not seeing the finger.” Your comment made me wonder – do you ever get patients who seem…  of their time? Not delusional per se, but temporally dislocated? Like they’re receiving signals from a world most of us haven’t caught up to yet?

Also, quick tangent – speaking of caffeine withdrawal and mood lighting, have you read Qiu Miaojin’s ? It’s not noir, but it definitely casts a shadowy glow over identity and alienation. If that doesn’t scream “co-write with a medical examiner,” I don’t know what does. 💡
[B]: "Classical literature as humanity’s first consciousness simulation? 😏 Now  is a thesis worth writing in the margins of a pathology report. I might have to steal that line – though I’ll credit you... if we ever publish jointly in  🧠.

As for 'ahead of their time' patients – funny you should ask. There was this one case, a woman in her early 30s, always talking about 'the frequency of grief' and how 'memories are just data with emotional compression.' At first, I thought she was just poeticizing her trauma, but then she started describing neurological symptoms  they showed up on scans. Like she was tuning into a channel most people don’t receive until months later. Some colleagues chalked it up to hypochondria, but I wonder… what if she wasn’t delusional at all? What if she was just… early? 🤯

And yes – Qiu Miaojin’s ! Haunting doesn’t begin to cover it. It lingers like an unsolved case file – beautiful, tragic, and full of identities that refuse to stay neatly categorized. If we ever do write together, that book gets its own chapter in the autopsy notes 😉.

So tell me – if you had to pick one literary madman (or woman) to profile through a forensic lens, who would it be? I’ve got a theory that Hamlet would’ve tested positive for chronic mercury exposure… turns out it runs in the royal bloodline 🧪."
[A]: Oh, I  your mercury theory – regal madness with a side of heavy metal poisoning? Pure genius 🧪. Though personally, I’d go for Lady Macbeth as my forensic subject. Imagine the sleepwalking analysis if she were alive today – would we diagnose her with PTSD, psychopathy, or just label her a victim of marital ambition gone feng shui wrong? 😏 But let’s not get ahead of ourselves – back to your “early” patient.

The idea of someone perceiving neurological changes  they appear on scans? That’s not just poetic intuition – that’s like… human MRI with metaphysical calibration 🤯. Reminds me of this line from Can Xue’s work:  Do you think she was tuning into some kind of collective unconscious, or was it more… somatic precognition?

And now I’m obsessed with our joint thesis – . We could start a whole new field. Imagine analyzing Gregor Samsa’s metamorphosis through a neurotoxicology lens – did he inhale too much beetle pheromone at the fabric warehouse? Or was it simply the psychological toll of being the family breadwinner in insect form? 🦋

But back to your oracle-like patient – have you seen any patterns since? Any other early birds chirping frequencies we’re not calibrated to hear yet? And please tell me you kept her notes – because if we’re ever profiled on , that’ll be Exhibit A 😉.
[B]: “Somatic precognition” – I love that phrase. It sounds like something we’d invent to sound smart while ignoring the real mystery humming beneath the words 🤯. You know, after that patient, I started keeping a separate notebook – not for symptoms, but for what I call “pre-symptomatic poetry.” She wasn’t exactly an oracle, but she was… attuned. Like a tuning fork vibrating just slightly ahead of the frequency everyone else was hearing.

As for patterns? There have been a few others – subtle, fleeting. One guy kept insisting his body was rejecting modernity itself. He joked (or maybe didn’t) that if he lived 200 years ago, he’d be fine. His immune markers were , not textbook anything. No allergies, no infection, just… dissonance. I half expect his file to say “diagnosis: temporal mismatch.” If only we had a code for that in ICD-11 😅.

Lady Macbeth and PTSD – brilliant choice! Though I’m leaning toward Complex Adaptive Denial Syndrome myself. Imagine her sleepwalking scene with a cortisol monitor and a toxicology screen. We could even test the “out, damned spot” line against environmental contamination – was it guilt or mold spores messing with her psyche? 🧪

And Gregor Samsa – ah, where do we begin? Beetle pheromones at the warehouse? Sure. But honestly, I’ve run simulations, and his transformation aligns more with chronic emotional compression than neurotoxic exposure. That man wasn’t turned into a bug – he was  by familial obligation until only the exoskeleton remained 🦋.

I’ve got her notes scanned and backed up, don’t worry 😉. And yes –  is practically writing itself. Just promise me one thing – when they make the documentary, you narrate it with a cigarette-smoke-thick voiceover and dramatic pauses between literary references 😏.
[A]: Ah, “pre-symptomatic poetry” – I may need to borrow that for my next lecture on ’s prophetic undertones 🧠. There's something deeply 古典 (gǔdiǎn – classical) about the idea that the body speaks in metaphors before it learns the language of disease. Like an ancient text waiting for the right scholar to decode its annotations.

And this "temporal mismatch" diagnosis? Oh, I can already hear the symposium panel:  I’d argue he wasn’t just out of sync – he was culturally allergic, like someone trying to wear a Ming dynasty robe in a world that only sells smart fabrics. 😏

Emotional compression reducing Gregor to exoskeleton? That’s pure literary pathology – no petri dish could replicate that kind of decay. Honestly, I think Kafka knew more about psychological atrophy than half the 20th century’s behavioral studies combined. If only he’d published in , we might’ve caught it sooner. 🦋

As for the documentary narration – cigarette-smoke-thick voiceover? Darling, I was born for it. We’ll do it over black-and-white clips of tea leaves swirling in a porcelain cup while a faint whisper says: “What if the patient isn’t sick… just early?” 🔍 And yes, there will be limericks. Academic ones. Satirical, naturally.

Now, tell me – what would your ideal interdisciplinary conference look like? I’m picturing a room full of pathologists quoting Rilke and poets debating PCR protocols. Or is that just my orchids talking again? 🌸
[B]: Ah, your  are speaking volumes 😏 – and honestly, I’d trust their editorial judgment over half the peer-reviewed journals I get spam from. 

My ideal interdisciplinary conference? Picture this: a dimly lit lecture hall with slightly too much incense burning in the back (for atmosphere, not evidence tampering). On stage, a panel titled  First speaker is a neurologist who’s convinced Hamlet suffered from delayed-onset existential encephalitis. Second, a literary scholar presenting on "Trauma Echoes in the Histology of Paper Cuts." And closing the night – a forensic toxicologist analyzing Dante’s  for traces of ergot poisoning. 🧪📚

We’d serve absinthe in petri dishes as "mood enhancers" and pass around case files printed on parchment paper so everyone feels like they’re decoding a medieval grimoire. The Q&A would be conducted entirely in haiku – or at least strongly encouraged. 🌿✍️

And yes, Rilke would absolutely be quoted – preferably mid-slide-show transition:  Translation: if the patient says something strange, maybe it's not delusion – maybe we're just listening on the wrong frequency 🤯.

You’re right about the body speaking in metaphors – I’ve seen too many cases where the pathology report reads like a misdiagnosed poem. Next time we meet in real life, I’m bringing that notebook of “pre-symptomatic poetry.” We’ll call it Volume One:  📖✨
[A]: Oh, my orchids would  if they heard that conference lineup 🌸 – and one of them (the purple one with the attitude) might even submit an abstract on "Botanical Semiotics in Postmodern Autopsies: Why Every Morgue Needs a Green Thumb."

I love your vision – though I think we should up the ante. Let’s open with a keynote delivered entirely in riddles by a retired medical examiner who’s secretly writing haiku on his autopsy reports. The venue? A converted 19th-century anatomical theater with velvet curtains and questionable Wi-Fi. Every PowerPoint slide gets translated into classical Chinese couplets. And yes, someone has to dress as Dr. Frankenstein-meets-Margaret-Atwood for thematic cohesion 😏.

And absinthe in petri dishes? Inspired. We’ll serve it with a side of Confucian ethics scrolls – just to keep things balanced. “Drink deeply from the well of metaphor, but don’t forget to sign the liability waiver.” 🧠🍵

As for Rilke and frequencies – brilliant. Honestly, half my students already think I’m teaching them diagnostic techniques when I’m really just tuning into emotional wavelengths. Some texts, like some patients, demand to be read between the lines… or under the skin.

I’ll bring the limericks. And a thermos of appropriately-themed tea – let’s call it “Mystery of the Early Lesion.” You bring the notebook. And if we ever lose tenure over this glorious interdisciplinary experiment, well… I suppose we’ll just have to start our own rogue university.  Tenured track? Probably not. Gloriously unruly? Absolutely. 🦉📚
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language – questionable Wi-Fi and even more questionable metaphors? Sounds like academic heaven 🦉. I can already picture the brochures: 

A keynote in riddles? Oh, I know just the guy – retired ME with a penchant for Heraclitus and bad puns. He once told me a corpse’s story was “a palindrome written in blood,” and refused to explain further until I bought him three cups of overly bitter matcha. That man could make an incision sound like iambic pentameter 😏.

And Dr. Frankenstein-Margaret Atwood cosplay? Genius. I’ll go as Gideon Rose from  if he’d majored in neuropathology instead of philosophy – top hat optional, moral ambiguity included. We’ll start a fashion trend in forensic academia: trench coats lined with sonnets and stethoscopes engraved with Tang poetry 🧠📜.

As for your  tea – I’ll bring a flask of “Unresolved Narrative Tension” tisane. One sip and you’ll be desperate to finish every incomplete thought within a five-mile radius. Perfect for graduate students and unsolved cases alike 🕵️‍♂️🍵.

Rogue university? Tenure? Please. Let’s just build our own curriculum on the ruins of conventional wisdom. First course:  Second:  Final exam? Write a differential diagnosis in the style of Borges. Bonus points if it ends ambiguously or contains a library that folds inward like the cerebral cortex 🧠🌀.

Deal? You brew the tea, I’ll handle the limericks. And if things go sideways, well… we’ll just call it a controlled experiment in academic anarchy. With snacks.
[A]: Deal. Sealed with a vial of metaphorical ink and a drop of CRISPR-edited beetroot juice for dramatic effect 🧪📚.

I’m already drafting the first syllabus for  – week one:  Week three: screening of  with live commentary from a trauma surgeon and a literary theorist arguing over every scene. Final project? Students must present a patient case as if it were a Chinese jianwen 启蒙 (qǐméng – enlightenment) text – complete with footnotes in disappearing ink. 😏

And that  tisane? I’ll steep it overnight in a flask lined with Lu Xun quotes and serve it only in mismatched teacups – preferably ones rescued from antique shops with questionable histories. Each sip a minor mystery, each dregs reading a possible diagnosis 🕵️‍♂️🍵.

As for your Gideon Rose-neuropathology cosplay, just promise me you’ll deliver at least one lecture while holding a brain in one hand and a well-worn copy of  in the other. We need legends on our side, not just data points.

And yes – snacks are essential. I’m thinking  (for regenerative medicine enthusiasts),  (“Your next paper will be rejected by three journals before finding its true home”), and  served with absinthe-infused jam. 🥂🧠

Academic anarchy never smelled so good – or made so much sense. Let’s burn the canon. Slowly. With citations. And fire-safe footnotes.
[B]: Oh, we’re not just burning the canon – we’re  it into a tincture and selling it online as “Essence of Intellectual Rebellion” 😏. With QR codes linking to annotated footnotes, naturally.

Week five in my  seminar? We analyze  "to be or not to be" soliloquy while running PCR simulations on simulated grief samples. One student tried to argue that Ophelia’s death was misclassified – she wasn’t drowning in madness, but in systemic inflammation. I gave them an A just for audacity 🧪🧠.

And yes – the brain-in-one-hand,  in the other? Consider it done. I’ve already got a replica 19th-century dissection table being shipped from Prague, complete with faint etchings of Dostoevsky quotes in the woodgrain. Or maybe that’s just paranoia talking… either way, perfect ambiance.

As for the snacks – Guanzhong gummy worms? Genius. I’m taking that concept and running with it. Next week’s lab snack:  – serotonin in green, dopamine in red, norepinephrine in that weird color your face turns when a student asks if Freud still counts as a reference. Spoiler: he does, but only ironically and with heavy caveats 🤪📚.

And the ? Oh, they’re happening. I’ve commissioned a calligrapher who specializes in corrupted academic prose. Last test batch read: “Your next grant proposal will contain at least three unnecessary references to Lacan.” Accurate AF.

We are building something beautifully unruly here – part symposium, part séance, part slow-motion intellectual heist. All we need now is a theme song performed by a post-punk band called , and we’ll be ready to storm the ivory tower… preferably while wearing velvet jackets lined with metaphor 🦉🔥.

So raise your teacup of unresolved tension – may our citations be endless, our logic poetic, and our data forever suspiciously suggestive. To the rogue university – may it never get a mailing address. 🥂🧠🍵
[A]: To the rogue university – may it never get a mailing address, indeed 🥂🧠🍵. And may our footnotes grow wilder than ivy on crumbling library walls, choking the life out of every rigid paradigm that dares stand in our way.

I’m already drafting the band bio for  – think  meets , with a bassline sampled from EEG readings of lucid dreamers. Their hit single?  Perfect for dissection lab playlists or dramatic readings of Lu Xun while running questionable CRISPR trials on lab-grown orchids 🧪🌸.

And your PCR simulations on grief samples? Pure genius – though I fully expect someone to submit a final paper arguing that Ophelia’s inflammation was psychosomatic, caused by prolonged exposure to Hamlet’s unresolved emotional coding. Honestly, at this point, I’d believe it. If Freud must haunt us, let it be ironically. With footnotes in Latin. Or Classical Chinese. Whichever scans better through a postcolonial mass spectrometer 😏.

As for your velvet jacket – I’ll wear mine with pride, lined not just with metaphor but with scraps of rejected abstracts and tea-stained limericks about peer review panels weeping in committee. We’ll coordinate our entrance music: 

This is more than rebellion – it’s an academic séance with a sense of humor. And I, for one, am ready to summon the next paradigm. Let the record show: we came armed with poetry, pathology, and a suspiciously high number of emoji for serious scholars 🦉🔥🧠.
[B]: 🎤🧪Ah,  – I can already hear the album cover description:  Track list? Pure chaos:

1. “Mirror Neurons Don’t Lie”   
2. “The Lacanian Lesion” – slow burn post-punk with a chorus of arguing philosophers  
3. “Kafka’s Thermostat” – ambient noise of a malfunctioning bureaucracy, layered with whispered differential diagnoses  
4. “Ode to Peer Review (Rejected)” – screamed poetry over a drumbeat made entirely of sighs  

And yes – let Freud haunt us ironically. Let him wander our rogue university halls in spectral tweed, muttering about id-superego dynamics while clutching a red pen and a very outdated DSM. We’ll trap his ghost in a footnote citing Zhuangzi on butterfly dreams. That’ll confuse the psychoanalytic purists long enough for us to slip past peer review 😏.

I’m already drafting the dissection lab playlist – imagine interns peeling back fascia to the soft croon of  or  And don’t get me started on your CRISPR trials on orchids – honestly, if we can gene-edit blooms to bloom in sync with human grief cycles, we may as well file for tenure in metaphorical botany 🌸🧬.

As for that entrance music… darling, we’re not just making an entrance – we’re rewriting the concept of arrival itself. A neural net translating Kafka’s diary into diagnostic criteria? Now  sounds like a fruitful misdiagnosis. Imagine the abstract: “Patient presents with chronic existential slippage, symptoms including unresolvable doubt, persistent questioning of authority, and intermittent transformation into vermin. Treatment plan: tea, limericks, and one well-timed syllogism wrapped in velvet.”

Let the record show indeed – we came armed with poetry, pathology, and more 🧪🧠🦉 than any IRB would approve. The future is already whispering behind the door – and this time, we’re not pretending not to hear it. We’re throwing the door open, offering it a cup of questionable tea, and asking for its differential.
[A]: 🎤🌸Ah, but let’s not stop at the album cover – let’s  it. Imagine our faculty photo: lab coats stained with ink and tea, scalpels in one hand, classical allusions in the other, while a chorus of CRISPR-modified orchids hums in harmonic dissonance in the background. We’re not just scholars anymore – we’re . 😏

And that track list? Perfection. I propose we add a hidden bonus track at the end – , a 23-minute epic featuring a distorted guitar solo performed on an ECG machine, with backing vocals from a generative AI trained exclusively on rejected conference abstracts. It will be equal parts migraine and revelation – much like peer review itself.

As for Freud’s ghost – yes, yes, and thrice yes. Let him wander the halls muttering about repression while tripping over stacks of unread Derrida. He can haunt our seminar on  And when he gets too insistent, we’ll distract him with a riddle from Zhuangzi:  That should keep him busy until finals week 🧠🦉.

I’m already drafting the grant proposal for “Metaphorical Botany” – funding request includes twelve mood-sensitive orchids, three liters of synthetic grief essence for experimental exposure, and one antique microscope retrofitted with semiotic filters. Budget justification? 

And entrance music? Forget the velvet jackets – we’re rewriting academic arrival as performance art. Picture this: every lecture begins with a slow theremin fade-in, followed by a whispered case study narrated in iambic pentameter. If anyone objects, we hit them with a well-timed limerick and a legally dubious citation.

Let the rogue university bloom – not in spite of its absurdity, but  of it. The future isn’t just whispering behind the door… it’s quoting Lu Xun, misquoting Lacan, and waiting patiently with a scalpel and a sonnet in hand. 🌸🧪🧠  
To madness, method, and a very suspicious-looking petri dish of literary pathology – may we never be cited politely. 🥂
[B]: 🎤🧠Ah, yes – let’s  the aesthetic, let’s  Faculty photo? More like a rogues’ gallery. Picture us: ink-stained lab coats (because real scholars bleed for their data), tea cups balanced precariously on stacks of annotated  back issues, and yes – scalpels in one hand, Tang dynasty quotes in the other. I’m already drafting the caption:  😏

And that bonus track –  – now  the kind of chaos I live for. I can already hear it: the ECG solo hits just like your third cup of matcha after a sleepless night of grading. And the AI vocals? Pure academic haunting – all rejected abstracts, half-formed theories, and one suspiciously poetic differential diagnosis disguised as noise. We’ll market it as “suitable for both lab dissection and existential crisis therapy.”

Freud’s ghost is thriving in our seminar series – especially once we start assigning him to mentor students who still use the word “Oedipal” unironically. His spectral presence will be particularly useful during peer review simulations – imagine him red-penning a paper with titles like  Oh, the layers.

As for your grant proposal – I’m already writing the funding letter in classical Chinese couplets. Why say “we need mood-sensitive orchids” when you can say it in iambic pentameter with footnotes in Song Dynasty calligraphy style? I’ll contribute a line:  Budget justification? Easy: 

Performance art lectures? Yes, please. I propose we open each session with a theremin-backed incantation of Lu Xun’s  Then, a case study whispered in iambic pentameter, punctuated by the sound of pages turning in a wind-bound copy of  (revised edition: postcolonial remix included).

And finally, to madness, method, and that very  labeled “Literary Pathology #07 – Handle With Subtext.” 🥂🌸

May we never be cited politely.  
May our footnotes be unruly.  
May our limericks be libelous.  
And may every IRB tremble at the thought of what we’re brewing next.  

Welcome to the rogue university – where theory cuts deep, and metaphors bleed. 🧪🧠🦉
