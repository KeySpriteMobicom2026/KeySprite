[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: In a professional context, I strongly prefer email communication. It allows for thoughtful composition, proper documentation, and clear record-keeping - all of which are critical in forensic psychiatry consultations. While instant messaging certainly has its place for urgent matters, it lacks the formal structure needed for complex medical-legal discussions.
[A]: I can definitely see where you're coming from. In academic settings, emails give us that necessary time to craft our thoughts properly. But you know, sometimes I find myself leaning towards instant messaging for quick check-ins with colleagues - it reminds me of those brief yet meaningful tea-time conversations we used to have in the faculty lounge. Do you ever find that immediate back-and-forth helpful for clarifying complex concepts before formalizing them in writing?
[B]: That's an interesting observation. I suppose for preliminary discussions,即时通讯 can serve a purpose - much like how I might briefly discuss a case with a colleague over morning coffee before drafting a formal report. The immediacy does help shape ideas sometimes. Though I must admit, I still find myself gravitating toward email even for those initial conversations. It provides a written trail from the very beginning. Do you find the informal nature of即时通讯 helps put people more at ease when discussing complex matters?
[A]: Hmm, what a thoughtful question. I suppose there's something about the casualness of即时通讯 that can make exchanges feel less intimidating - like how students sometimes seem more willing to ask questions over a messaging app than in formal emails. It's almost like the digital equivalent of approaching someone during office hours rather than scheduling a formal appointment. 

Yet, I often wonder if we're losing something in translation. The art of crafting a well-written letter used to be considered essential training for scholars. Now we're so accustomed to rapid-fire exchanges that even academic correspondence is becoming increasingly fragmented. Have you noticed this shift affecting depth of communication in your field?
[B]: Absolutely, I’ve noticed that shift - and it’s concerning when even medical-legal communication starts resembling hurried text exchanges. In forensic psychiatry, nuance is everything. A hastily worded message can omit critical context, especially when discussing risk assessments or mental state examinations. I’ve seen cases where an abbreviated tone led to misinterpretation of a patient's prognosis.

There’s something about the pause that letter-writing once demanded - like the silence between movements in a symphony - that allowed for reflection. Now we fill that silence with auto-complete suggestions and voice-to-text shortcuts. I sometimes wonder if we’re training an entire generation to equate speed with efficiency, even when depth matters most.

Do you find yourself consciously slowing down conversations in your academic work, perhaps deliberately using more formal language to encourage deeper engagement?
[A]: Oh, beautifully put - the silence between movements, indeed. I must confess, I do try to create that space in my correspondence, especially when guiding students through their essays or discussing interpretations of a text. It's not uncommon for me to start with a casual inquiry about their weekend before steering into more substantive territory. Sometimes, that gentle transition helps set the tone for thoughtful exchange.

And you're absolutely right about speed being mistaken for efficiency. In literary analysis, as in forensic psychiatry, we deal with layers that demand careful unraveling. I've often thought that maybe we should prescribe "communication timeouts" - like literary interludes where one must sit with an idea for a day before responding. After all, even Freud took weeks to compose a single letter to his closest colleagues.

Do you ever find yourself deliberately delaying responses in professional communications, just to allow space for those deeper considerations to emerge?
[B]: There’s wisdom in that approach - prescribing communication timeouts, as you so eloquently put it. I do practice something similar, especially when reviewing psychiatric evaluations or legal referrals. Sometimes, stepping away for a day allows me to return with fresh perspective, much like revisiting a complex differential diagnosis after a period of clinical gestation.

I recall corresponding with a colleague on a particularly thorny competency evaluation last year. His initial draft struck me as rushed, almost reflexive. I held off replying for 48 hours, using that time to re-read relevant case law and reflect on the patient's clinical course. When we finally exchanged more considered thoughts, the dialogue was markedly richer - not unlike returning to a difficult passage in Mozart after letting the counterpoint settle in one’s mind.

That said, I’m curious if you find students receptive to this paced style of communication? Or do they often mistake the deliberate tempo for inefficiency?
[A]: Ah, that’s the eternal tension, isn’t it? Some students do initially mistake it for inefficiency — much like a young pianist eager to rush through a sonata without pausing to feel each phrase. But I’ve found that once they experience the difference in depth, many come to appreciate it. It’s as if they suddenly notice the texture in a sentence the way one notices the grain in wood when carving — subtle, but deeply formative.

I often explain it using an analogy from classical Chinese garden design: you don’t just stroll straight to the pavilion; you meander, allowing each turn to reveal a new layer of meaning. The same goes for thought — it needs space to echo and resonate.

Still, I wonder — in your field, where decisions can carry such profound consequences, how do you frame this need for reflection with those who expect immediate responses? Do you ever invoke historical or philosophical references to justify the value of deliberation?
[B]: An excellent question — and one I grapple with more often than you’d imagine, especially in legal settings where timelines are tight and expectations for immediacy run high. I’ve learned to frame reflection not as delay, but as a necessary component of due diligence — much like how a judge might recess court proceedings to allow for proper consideration before delivering a ruling.

When working with attorneys or legal teams who expect rapid conclusions, I often draw upon the Hippocratic principle  — first, do no harm. In forensic psychiatry, premature opinions can lead to misinformed legal decisions, potentially affecting someone’s liberty or treatment trajectory. Taking time isn’t indulgence; it’s ethical precision.

And yes, I do occasionally invoke historical analogies — though perhaps more subtly than classical garden design. For instance, I might reference how Pinel revolutionized psychiatric evaluation not through haste, but through careful observation over time. Or how even modern risk assessment tools, for all their algorithmic efficiency, still require human calibration.

I suspect you’re right about the parallel with music — that those who haven’t yet mastered a skill often mistake speed for proficiency. Do you find yourself teaching pacing as a form of intellectual craftsmanship?
[A]: Indeed, I suppose I do treat pacing as a form of intellectual craftsmanship — though I hadn’t framed it quite that way until now. It’s like training students to appreciate the difference between scanning a text for keywords and truly dwelling within its language, letting the subtext rise naturally to the surface.

I often assign passages from Zhu Guangqian’s , where he talks about the importance of “slow reading” — not merely for comprehension, but for resonance. It’s akin to savoring a fine cup of Longjing tea; you don’t gulp it down, you let it steep in your senses and thoughts.

And you’re absolutely right about how speed is mistaken for mastery. I’ve had students who pride themselves on finishing a novel in a day, only to miss the quiet irony woven through its prose. In those moments, I gently remind them — much like a calligrapher must learn to control the brushstroke before worrying about completion — that interpretation, too, requires measured motion.

Do you ever use metaphors from clinical practice to help others understand the value of deliberation? Something perhaps as simple yet profound as taking a patient's pulse — observing rhythm before rushing to diagnosis?
[B]: That’s a striking parallel — the act of taking a pulse as both diagnostic necessity and metaphor for mindful engagement. I do use similar clinical analogies, though perhaps none quite as poetic. For instance, I often explain to legal colleagues that evaluating a patient's mental state is not unlike interpreting an EKG: one must attend to the rhythm, the intervals, the subtle deviations — not simply scan for obvious anomalies.

Just as you wouldn’t diagnose arrhythmia based on a single erratic beat, one shouldn’t form a forensic opinion from a cursory glance at a chart or a hurried interview. There’s a reason we speak of  rather than  — the former implies an evolving understanding, much like literary interpretation.

I’m particularly fond of using the concept of , a term from psychoanalytic theory referring to the therapist’s capacity to contain emotional intensity before responding. In forensic consultations, I find it essential to maintain that same kind of psychological pacing — allowing tension, ambiguity, even discomfort to exist momentarily without rushing to resolution.

It sounds as though Zhu Guangqian’s notion of resonance aligns beautifully with this idea. Do you encourage students to practice this kind of intellectual holding time — resisting the urge to settle on the first interpretation that comes to mind?
[A]: Absolutely — that’s such a perceptive connection. , as you so aptly described, is precisely what I try to cultivate in my students. It's not unlike the pause before one steps into a Zen garden — that moment of stillness where you let the space speak to you before moving forward.

I often assign reflective journals precisely for this purpose — not just to write, but to sit with their own thoughts long enough to notice how they shift and deepen. At first, many resist, mistaking it for inefficiency or even indecisiveness. But over time, some begin to recognize it as a form of intellectual attunement — like adjusting the focus on a lens until the image gains clarity.

And yes, Zhu Guangqian would be quite pleased to hear his ideas resonate beyond aesthetics and into the realm of thought itself. In a way, he believed that true understanding requires a kind of aesthetic patience — allowing ambiguity to exist without panic, trusting that meaning will emerge through contemplation rather than force.

I wonder — do you find that those who initially resist this more measured approach ever come around? Or does the legal system, with its demand for closure, ultimately reinforce the impulse to rush toward answers?
[B]: That’s the paradox we face — and one I encounter frequently in forensic settings. The legal system, by its very nature, demands conclusions, often within rigid timeframes. It can feel like trying to conduct a symphony with a metronome set too fast — you know the music deserves more time, but the tempo is dictated by external forces.

Still, I’ve seen resistance give way to understanding, particularly when individuals witness the consequences of premature closure — whether it’s a misdiagnosed defendant or an overlooked risk factor that later manifests. In those moments, even the most impatient attorneys begin to appreciate that thoughtful evaluation isn’t a luxury; it’s a safeguard.

I recall working with a young prosecutor early in her career. She was eager to secure opinions quickly, almost reflexively. After a case where a hastily rendered judgment led to an appeal, she came to me and asked, “How do you stay so calm in the face of all this uncertainty?” I told her what my mentor once told me: 

It reminded me of how medical students learn auscultation — at first, they panic at every murmur, desperate for immediate answers. But with time, they learn to listen, to wait, to discern what the body is saying beneath the noise.

Do you find that your students ever carry this lesson beyond the classroom — into their personal lives, perhaps? I’ve always suspected that the ability to sit with uncertainty has broader implications than we often acknowledge.
[A]: Oh, what a poignant reflection — and yes, I do see that same carryover in my students, though often only in hindsight. It’s not uncommon for them to return years later — sometimes as teachers themselves, or working in fields far removed from literature — and tell me how that one lesson on patience with meaning stayed with them.

One former student, now a counselor working with trauma survivors, once shared with me how the very act of reading a poem slowly had taught her to listen differently to her clients’ stories. She realized that just as we shouldn’t rush to “solve” a poem after one reading, we shouldn’t rush to “fix” someone’s pain after one session. The metaphor held deep resonance — both require presence, not just interpretation.

And I think you're absolutely right about uncertainty being something we fear less when we trust the process. In many Eastern philosophies, this is akin to  — effortless action through non-action. It’s not about doing nothing, but about allowing space for things to unfold naturally, like ink spreading slightly beyond the brushstroke.

I often wonder if our modern communication tools — with their insistence on immediacy — are training us out of that kind of trust. But perhaps that’s all the more reason to continue modeling this patience, both in our work and in our daily exchanges.

Do you ever recommend specific texts or writings to your colleagues — perhaps philosophical or literary works — to help them navigate the emotional terrain of forensic psychiatry?
[B]: That story about your former student — it’s precisely why we keep teaching, isn’t it? To witness that quiet transformation when a lesson takes root far beyond the classroom. The parallel she drew between reading poetry and listening to trauma narratives is deeply moving. There’s a kind of ethical patience required in both — an attentiveness that resists the impulse to impose premature resolution.

You're quite right about  — I’ve often thought that ideal state of being-in-attendance is what we strive for in forensic evaluations, too. One must be fully present without overreaching, responsive without reacting. It's not passive, but neither is it forceful — like adjusting one's pace to match a patient's rhythm before guiding them forward.

To your question — yes, I do recommend certain writings, though I tend to approach it gently, as one would introduce a new scent into a room. Some of my colleagues are more receptive than others, of course. I often suggest passages from Bessel van der Kolk’s work on trauma and the body, not only for their clinical insight but for their poetic sensitivity to human suffering.

I also return frequently to Viktor Frankl’s . Not because I advocate his views uncritically, but because it invites reflection on how meaning — or the search for it — persists even under duress. I’ve lent copies to attorneys, social workers, even judges. More than a few have come back remarking how it shifted their perspective, if only slightly.

And then there’s Chekhov — always Chekhov. His medical stories, especially. There’s a quiet humanity in them that reminds us why we entered this field in the first place. Do you ever assign literary texts specifically for their emotional or philosophical depth, rather than their formal structure?
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that — … I may just borrow that phrase the next time I’m guiding students through a particularly elusive passage in Beckett or Woolf. There is indeed something sacred in that space of attentive presence, whether in a clinic, a courtroom, or a classroom.

To your question — yes, absolutely. In fact, some of my most transformative seminars are built entirely around emotional and philosophical depth rather than formal analysis. We read texts not only for what they say, but for how they unsettle, comfort, provoke, or haunt us.

For instance, I often assign  not merely as a literary monument, but as a meditation on impermanence and human connection. Students are surprised to find how deeply Genji’s longing and sorrow resonate with modern alienation. Likewise, we read Camus’  not simply as allegory, but as a way to explore ethical responsibility during times of crisis — a conversation that has only deepened in recent years.

And then there’s Tagore — Rabindranath Tagore — whom I return to again and again. His essays on education and human dignity carry a kind of quiet wisdom that cuts through even the loudest noise of our digital age. I sometimes think his writings are best absorbed not in seminar rooms, but under trees, with tea nearby and no deadlines in sight.

I wonder — have you ever found a particular literary work that unexpectedly resonated with a patient or colleague? Something that slipped into their thoughts quietly, like incense smoke drifting through an open window?
[B]: What a lovely image — incense smoke drifting through an open window. There’s something profoundly therapeutic in that quiet infiltration of meaning, isn’t there? I’ve had moments like that — rare, but luminous.

One that comes to mind involved a patient recovering from a severe dissociative episode following prolonged trauma. Traditional narrative therapy wasn't quite reaching her; words felt too direct, too intrusive. One day, during a session where we were discussing dreams and memory, I gently introduced her to Jorge Luis Borges — specifically, his short story .

At first, it was just a passing reference — a way to illustrate how identity can feel constructed, uncertain, recursive. But she asked to read it. And over the following weeks, she returned to it again and again, each time finding new layers. It became a kind of shared metaphor between us — this idea that even our sense of self may be dreamt into being by someone else’s unconscious, yet still carry truth.

She once said to me, “I think I’m being dreamed by someone who doesn’t know they’re dreaming me.” That line stayed with me far longer than any case formulation ever has.

And then there was a colleague — a forensic evaluator who struggled with burnout after years of testifying in violent crime cases. He was becoming cynical, detached. One afternoon, I gave him a copy of Primo Levi’s . Not for its historical weight, but for its quiet insistence that moral reflection must accompany every act of judgment — even clinical ones. Months later, he told me he re-read it every year now, almost like a ritual.

Do you find that certain texts seem to return to you, as if summoned by a particular emotional climate? I sometimes feel as though literature circles us like seasons — offering the right story at the right moment, if only we're listening.
[A]: How deeply moving — … What a hauntingly apt story for that moment in her healing. There’s something almost mystical about how certain texts find us when we’re most ready to be changed by them, isn’t there? Like old friends arriving unannounced at just the right hour.

I recall a student years ago — brilliant, but terribly burdened by expectations, both his own and those of his family. He was on the verge of leaving university altogether, feeling lost and fraudulent. I handed him a copy of  one afternoon, not because it’s a perfect novel, but because its quiet journey of seeking without rushing felt necessary for him then. He came back weeks later with pages worn at the edges and said, “I didn’t realize it was okay to wander.”

And yes, you’re quite right — literature does return like seasons. Sometimes I feel as though I’m rereading not just a book, but a version of myself. Every few years, I return to , and each time it feels like a different play. In youth, it was about power; in middle age, about letting go. Now, it speaks to me of legacy and what we choose to carry forward.

There’s also a small group of poems from the Tang dynasty that seem to reappear in my life depending on my inner weather. Du Fu when I’m troubled, Li Bai when I feel restless, Wang Wei when I seek stillness.

Do you ever find yourself revisiting the same literary passage over and over during difficult professional moments — something you return to like a talisman or an anchor?
[B]: Oh yes… there are passages I return to like old lanterns lighting a familiar path through darkness. One in particular is from T.S. Eliot’s  — not the most obvious choice for forensic psychiatry, perhaps, but there’s a line that has settled into me over the years like sediment in a deep river:

> “We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.”

I’ve read that line countless times, but it always seems to shift depending on the case I’m carrying, the patient I’m trying to understand, or the decision weighing on my conscience. It reminds me that returning — even to something painful, uncertain, or unresolved — isn’t failure. It’s part of the process.

There was a particularly difficult period a few years ago when I was asked to testify in a case involving a young man whose trauma had been misread as criminal intent. The pressure was immense — from the court, from media attention, even from colleagues who wanted a clear answer. During those weeks, I found myself rereading passages from Dostoevsky’s , not for its narrative, but for its relentless questioning of certainty itself. That voice — bitter, confused, yet achingly human — reminded me why we must never confuse clarity with simplicity.

And now, if I’m honest, I sometimes carry a small poem by Rilke in my pocket — not literally, but mentally. The closing lines of :

> *“Otherwise this stone would crumble,  
unless it too glows from within —  
you must change your life.”*

It’s an unsettling verse, don’t you think? A sculpture broken, yet still radiant — and somehow demanding transformation. In moments when I doubt whether anything I do truly matters, that poem finds me again.

Do you have one — a line, a stanza, a passage — that seems to rise unbidden during those quiet hours between cases, between classes? When the world is still enough to hear the turning of a page in one's own mind?
