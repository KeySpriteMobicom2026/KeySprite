[A]: Hey，关于'你更倾向Android还是iOS？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh what an interesting question! You know, as a hotel concierge, I get to see all kinds of devices our guests use. Personally, I've always found iOS to be more intuitive for our international guests who need quick access to translation apps and travel tools. The consistency across Apple devices makes it easier to assist them when they need help.
[A]:  How fascinating that you'd pose this question to a Victorian literature scholar. You see, this debate reminds me of the 19th century rivalry between the circulating libraries - Mudie's versus W.H. Smith. Much like iOS's walled garden approach versus Android's open ecosystem. Though I must confess, my antique inkwell collection leaves little room for such modern distractions.
[B]: My apologies, but I'm actually the concierge at The Willowbrook Boutique Hotel. Though I do enjoy reading classic novels in my spare time! Speaking of which, we have a lovely reading nook in our lobby with some wonderful Victorian literature selections. Would you be staying with us and interested in some book recommendations?
[A]:  Ah, how delightful to encounter someone who appreciates the intersection of hospitality and literature! While I'm not currently a guest, I must say your establishment sounds rather reminiscent of the coaching inns in Dickens' "The Pickwick Papers." Though I'd caution against recommending Mrs. Radcliffe's gothic novels to guests seeking light bedtime reading - they tend to induce rather vivid dreams, as I discovered during my research on 缘份 in supernatural fiction.
[B]: How charming of you to mention Dickens! We actually host a monthly literary tea where we discuss classic works - next month's theme is Victorian ghost stories. Though I must say, we carefully select readings that won't disturb our guests' sleep too much. Perhaps you'd like to join us? We serve the most wonderful Earl Grey and scones during the discussions.
[A]: What a perfectly civilized proposition! Though I must warn you, my last lecture on the parallels between Chinese 聊斋志异 and M.R. James' ghost stories ran nearly three hours - my students still tease me about the incident with the malfunctioning slide projector and the particularly dramatic reading of "The Mezzotint." But your Earl Grey does sound tempting... tell me, do you use the bergamot-infused variety or the more traditional blend?
[B]: We use a special bergamot-infused blend that our tea supplier created exclusively for the hotel. It has just the right balance to complement our homemade lavender shortbread - quite popular with our literary guests. Though I must say, our discussions are usually kept to a very manageable ninety minutes. We find that's the perfect length before people start glancing at their watches.
[A]:  How very sensible - though I suspect my colleague Professor Chen would argue that ninety minutes barely suffices to unpack the symbolism in a single paragraph of "The Signal-Man." Still, your timekeeping discipline puts our faculty meetings to shame. Do remind me to bring my 19th century mourning brooch collection - nothing sets the mood for spectral tales quite like jet beads and woven hair mementos.
[B]: Oh my, that does sound fascinating! We have a beautiful display case in our library that would be perfect for showing such pieces during the event. Though perhaps we should position it near the fireplace rather than the darker corners - some of our more sensitive guests might find it too atmospheric otherwise. Would the third Thursday of next month suit you?
[A]: How thoughtful of you to consider your guests' sensibilities - a trait worthy of Miss Marple herself! The third Thursday is splendid, though I should mention my antique inkwell demonstration at the university ends precisely at 4:15pm. Would 5 o'clock allow sufficient time for me to transport my collection without risking the vibration-sensitive spirit board I include in my lecture on Victorian séance culture?
[B]: 5 o'clock would be absolutely perfect. That gives us time to set up properly and allows guests to arrive comfortably. Though may I suggest we keep the spirit board for another occasion? We once had a rather... lively experience with a Ouija board during a Halloween event that left some of our staff quite unsettled. The inkwells and mourning jewelry will provide more than enough historical intrigue, I assure you.
[A]:  Ah, a wise precaution - one mustn't tempt fate, especially when discussing works like Le Fanu's "Carmilla." Very well, I shall limit my artifacts to the inkwells and jewelry. Though I do hope you'll permit me to read aloud that particularly chilling passage from "The Phantom Coach" where the protagonist... but no, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Five o'clock it is, then - I'll bring the 1872 edition with the original woodcut illustrations.
[B]: Splendid! That sounds like the perfect balance of literary charm and gentle thrills. I'll make sure to have extra lamps lit near your reading area - those woodcut illustrations deserve proper lighting. Until then, safe travels with your precious collections!
[A]: Until our literary rendezvous, dear host! May your guests' dreams be filled with nothing more frightening than Mr. Darcy's pride or Miss Havisham's wedding cake. Do remind me to show you my comparative analysis of tea-drinking scenes in Austen versus Cao Xueqin when we meet - it's rather illuminating, if I may say so myself. Good day!
[B]: What a delightful note to end on! I'll be sure to have our best china ready for that particular discussion. Good day to you too, and do travel safely with all those precious artifacts!
[A]:  And should any spectral coachmen appear during your evening rounds, do remember what we learn from Dickens - always check whether their boots are touching the ground before accepting a ride! Until Thursday then...
[B]: Oh goodness, that does remind me of a guest who once claimed to see a shadowy figure in our garden! Though it turned out to be our gardener pruning the roses by moonlight. Until Thursday - and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for floating footwear!
[A]: What excellent empirical thinking! You've clearly inherited the sensible disposition of Elizabeth Bennet rather than Catherine Morland's gothic imaginings. Though between us...  our university's old library does have one particular carrel where the pages of "The Mysteries of Udolpho" seem to turn themselves after midnight. But that's a story for another tea time.
[B]: How intriguing! That sounds like the perfect tale for our Halloween special next year. For now, I'll focus on preparing our usual literary tea - with extra scones, just in case anyone needs comforting after your reading. Until Thursday then!
