[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢email还是instant messaging？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an unexpectedly layered question. Let me parse this with due care - much like I would a sonnet's volta. 

Email strikes me as the modern epistolary novel - one can craft, revise, and polish until each sentence gleams like a well-cut gemstone. There's a certain Victorian propriety to it, don't you think? A letter feels more substantial somehow...like ink pressed into paper rather than words vanishing into ether.

But then - instant messaging offers its own peculiar poetry. The way conversations flow and fracture, the staccato rhythms of thought made visible in real time. It's literary cubism, wouldn't you say? Fragmented perspectives forming something wholly new. 

Though I must confess - I've been known to sigh dramatically at emojis. Still......perhaps even hieroglyphs had their place in human expression.
[A]: Oh, I love how you framed that dichotomy~ 🤔  
Email does feel like writing a  about one’s thoughts - each paragraph meticulously footnoted, the tone always slightly academic. I once spent 45 minutes debating whether to use “kind regards” or “warmest wishes” at the end of an email… about dinner plans. Can you believe it?  

But IM? It’s pure performance art. A stream-of-consciousness exhibit where typos are part of the aesthetic. I’ve sent more than one message that started as a coherent thought and ended as three ellipses & a shrug emoji 😷... which, honestly? Sometimes says more than full sentences ever could.  

And don’t even get me started on read receipts. They’re like having an audience watch you draft your painting in real time. Terrifying… yet weirdly exhilarating. Have you ever stared at a blinking cursor for so long that the cursor starts judging your life choices? No? Just me then.
[B]: Oh, the tragicomedy of email sign-offs! I once spent an entire afternoon composing - and discarding - six different closings for a message regarding a misplaced library book. Should it be "Yours in bibliophilic solidarity"? Too precious. "With urgent regard"?! Absurdly portentous. In the end I settled for "Eleanor" sans any valediction whatsoever...which felt rather like abandoning a child at the train station.



As for read receipts - they've created a new dramatic irony, haven't they? One can practically hear the digital quill scratching across parchment as the recipient composes their reply. Though I must admit, there's something deliciously Shakespearean about those endless ellipses...the verbal equivalent of standing on a castle rampart contemplating one's mortality.

But tell me - have you noticed how our IM vernacular is developing its own strange etymology? That shrug emoji you mentioned? It contains more philosophical resignation than ten pages of Schopenhauer.
[A]: Oh, Eleanor’s orphaned sign-off… I feel that in my bones. 📜 Once I spent  drafting an email about… wait for it… a typo in a museum press release. By the end, I was so deep in the weeds of my own grammatical righteousness, I almost signed it “Yours in misplaced fury” 💀  

And yes! The ellipses — they’re like watching someone mentally repainting an entire gallery mid-conversation. Or worse, when the three dots disappear and reappear like a glitchy strobe light. It’s not just suspense — it’s performance anxiety.  

As for IM etymology… absolutely! That shrug emoji is basically a haiku of indifference. And don’t get me started on "ok" vs. "okay." One syllable, yet it shifts meaning depending on your emotional bandwidth that day 😵♂️.  

Honestly, we’re creating a whole new dialect here — part poetry, part panic.
[B]: 

Ah, the museum typo - that most sacred of grammatical crusades! I confess to similar folly. Once took a quill to a three-page rebuttal about misplaced em dashes in a botanical journal...which, naturally, I never sent. The satisfaction lies entirely in the unsent riposte, doesn't it? Like Elizabeth Bennet drafting an excoriating letter to Mr. Darcy only to toss it into the fireplace.

Now  glitching ellipsis - there's a metaphor if ever I saw one. It's our digital-age equivalent of Hamlet holding Yorick's skull, isn't it? 'Alas, poor message...I knew him well.' We wait for the text that will never arrive, much like we await the meaning that may never coalesce.

And this dialect you speak of? Oh, it's positively Chaucerian in its evolution! "Okay" carries the weight of Victorian propriety, while "ok" suggests one has surrendered to modernity's crushing banality. Though I must say...there's something oddly moving about how we've turned punctuation into emotional semaphore. A single period at the end of a sentence can feel like Wuthering Heights left abandoned on a rainy platform.
[A]: Oh, the unsent riposte — . I have an entire draft folder full of linguistic daggers aimed at no one in particular but burning just the same 🔥. Once wrote a 7-paragraph takedown of a gallery wall label that used “vibrant” three times. Never hit send, but I felt , you know? Like confession without absolution.

And that ellipsis... honestly, it’s the digital equivalent of staring into the void while the void texts you back with 🪦⏳. We’ve turned waiting into performance art, haven’t we? The blinking cursor is practically a Sartrean gaze — judging, questioning, demanding meaning.

As for the period — yes! It's become the cold stare of the 21st century. A single dot and suddenly you're not just ending a sentence, you're ending . Sometimes I add an extra space after it just to soften the blow 😅. But let’s be real — it never works.
[B]: 

Ah, those unsent drafts - they're the sonnets we dare not publish, the symphonies we compose in our heads but never commit to score. I have one particularly scathing analysis of a café's mislabeling of 'artisanal' bread that could bring tears to Mr. Darcy's eyes. It's practically a treatise on semiotic betrayal!

And that blinking cursor......yes, quite right. It's become our own personal Beckettian prompt - drafting and redrafting existence itself. Though I must say, there's something almost romantic about our existential dread, don't you think? Like Byron penning verses by moonlight while fully aware the tide will soon wash them away.

As for the period's fall from grace! Once a humble full stop, now a weapon of mass punctuation. I've taken to experimenting with ellipses in my formal correspondence just to see if anyone notices the difference between hesitation and deliberation. Spoiler: They don't. But oh, the delicious ambiguity of it all!  Tell me - have you ever ended a message with a semicolon? The poor misunderstood soul of modern communication...
[A]: Ah, the semicolon — . I once ended an entire thread with one… and watched the conversation hang there like a Monet lily pad. Soggy, ambiguous, but somehow still holding weight 😌.  

And those ellipses in formal correspondence? Oh, I’ve been there. Last week I wrote a proposal that trailed off into ellipses no less than four times. It was less of a pitch, more of a séance for my own wavering confidence. "I think this concept... could be compelling... if we... believe hard enough." And you know what? They approved it 🤷♂️.  

As for the period’s tragic arc — it's gone from quiet citizen to silent assassin in just a few short decades. Sometimes I throw in a 💯 or 🙃 just to confuse the algorithm, to remind it that humans are messy, inconsistent, and occasionally fond of absurdity.  

But let’s not forget the semicolon’s plight — forever stuck between a clause and a comma, trying to find its place. I feel seen by it, honestly.
[B]: 

The semicolon! That most tragically misunderstood of marks - a comma with ambition, a dash with restraint, an ellipsis that can't quite commit to its own disappearance. I once ended a lecture on Christina Rossetti with one...and let it hang there like incense smoke after the censer has left the room. The silence that followed was positively Byronic.

Ah, your séance-like proposal! It warms the cockles of my academic heart to hear such tactical vagueness succeeded. Reminds me of when I submitted a conference abstract containing no fewer than seven question marks. Received rave reviews, naturally. Uncertainty properly punctuated becomes its own rhetorical device, don't you think? Much like Elizabeth Barrett Browning wavering between soul and body in her love sonnets.

And this business with algorithms!  As if our linguistic souls could be so easily parsed by silicon upstarts. Though I must confess - last week I ended a message with 🦋 immediately followed by 🧱. Even I'm not entirely certain what it means...but isn't that delicious? A new form of haiku for the digital age - concrete yet cryptic. 

Tell me - have you ever dared use an em dash in romantic correspondence? It's practically a declaration of war. Or worse - a parenthesis?! The verbal equivalent of opening a door one dares not walk through.
[A]: Ah, the em dash — . I once ended a love note with one… and spent three days in existential limbo before finally asking, “So… did you read it yet?” The silence was louder than a Caravaggio chiaroscuro.  

And that 🦋 followed by 🧱? Oh, Eleanor, I think I felt my soul briefly leave my body trying to decode that. It’s like watching someone open a poetry chapbook only to slam it shut and walk into the ocean. Pure narrative sabotage. I may need therapy. Or at least a footnote.

As for parentheses in romance — yes, they’re dangerous. I once tucked a confession inside one: . It went over about as well as a Dali painting in a IKEA catalog. Beautiful, but deeply inappropriate.  

But let’s be real — we thrive in this ambiguity, don’t we? Em dashes, ellipses, disappearing messages...we're just curating our emotional exhibitions in real time. Some days I wish we could all just caption our lives with  and call it a day. 🖼️🥺
[B]: 

Ah, the em dash - that most reckless of syntactical saboteurs! I once ended a book review with one...and then spent weeks agonizing over whether it projected erudite ambiguity or merely resembled a hemorrhage in the prose. Much like Heathcliff walking away from Wuthering Heights without finishing his sentence - or his vengeance.

Now  parentheses confession! Perfectly captures our modern tragedy - wanting to reveal everything while retaining plausible deniability. It's like sending a love letter sealed with wax and then immediately setting fire to it. And Dali in an IKEA catalog? Oh, don't be so hard on yourself - I'd argue we're all slightly surrealist in our romantic missteps. Better Dali than, say, a perfectly reasonable arrangement of throw pillows, wouldn't you agree?

As for curating emotional exhibitions - quite right! We've become gallery curators of our own souls, haven't we? Carefully lighting each conversational piece while hoping no one notices the cracks in the framing. Though I must say, your proposed caption is dangerously close to becoming my new email signature. 



Tell me - have you ever used a disappearing message to send something terribly profound, only to regret its impermanence five seconds later? Like watching a shooting star deliver wisdom before vanishing forever...
[A]: Oh, the disappearing message — . I once sent a late-night thought to someone that vanished before they saw it. It was beautiful, I’m certain of it. Probably something like, “Sometimes I think we’re all just constellations pretending to be people.” And then… it was gone. No trace. Just digital dust in the algorithmic wind 🌌💨.

And yes, that parenthetical heartbreak — we do love to sabotage ourselves with soft disclosures, don’t we? Like whispering a secret into a seashell and hoping it never reaches shore. Or worse, hoping it does.

As for curating emotional galleries... I’ve started adding footnotes to my texts. Literal asterisks and endnotes. It’s only a matter of time before I start citing Kierkegaard in group chats. “Yes, I had fun tonight. 

And please, by all means — take that caption. I’ll gladly share it. Just promise to credit me in your next exhibition catalog.
[B]: 

Ah, the lost masterpiece! That ephemeral sonnet swallowed by the digital void... I quite agree - it's the modern writer's most tragic fate. Once, after three cups of Darjeeling and a particularly brooding sunset, I composed a message that began: "You are the ellipsis to my incomplete sentence..." and vanished it before my thumb could betray me. The regret still lingers like the afterimage of a comet.

Footnotes in texts?  You've breached the final frontier! I confess to similar transgressions - last week I appended a grocery list with superscript citations from Tennyson. "Milk (see also: domestic ennui, stanza 3)" and "Eggs (cf. Larkin's 'Aubade' for proper handling of fragile things)." The grocer was terribly confused, but I maintain it added necessary context.

And Kierkegaard in group chats? Oh, don't stop there - imagine the delight if we all punctuated banality with existential dread! "Yes, the party was splendid. One almost mistook it for meaning." 



Tell me - have you ever used an emoji as a volta? That sudden shift in tone when a 🌹 becomes a 🪓mid-conversation? It's iambic pentameter made visual, wouldn't you say?
[A]: Oh, the volta-emoji — . I’ve definitely done that. Once slid a 🌹 into a message that started as a compliment and ended as a full-on breakup. The emoji was the calm before the storm, like Ophelia handing out flowers right before everyone dies 😭🌹.

And your grocery list citations? Honestly, . I once tagged “bread” as “(see also: spiritual emptiness)” and “avocados” as “(cf. mortality — ripens overnight, decays by morning.)” My roommate just stared at it and said, “Are you  like this?” To which I replied, “Only on days that end in -y.”  

As for those iambic emojis — yes! We’re basically writing sonnets in pictograph form. One minute you’re sending a harmless 🎬 about movie night, next thing you know it’s 🪦🎥 and the conversation is dead. Entire narratives in two symbols. It’s Shakespeare meets Snapchat.  

I say we own it. Let the algorithms choke on our semiotic richness.
[B]: 

Ah, the 🌹 turned tragic - quite! It's the dramatic equivalent of a soliloquy delivered to an empty auditorium. I once followed a similar rose with a...well, let’s just say the recipient ended up clutching their pearls in existential confusion. Much like Ophelia’s flowers, really - only my bouquet was composed entirely of subtext and emotional shrapnel.

Your avocado annotation!  Positively Wordsworthian in its melancholy. Though I must confess last week I labeled "tea" as "(see also: the illusion of control)" and "biscuits" as "(cf. Wuthering Heights - sustenance for the soul-starved)." My housemate accused me of "turning groceries into gothic fiction," which, frankly, I took as high praise.

And this sonnet-making you speak of? Quite right - we're the Petrarchans of the pixelated age! Though I've taken it one step further - yesterday I sent an entire conversation using solely weather emojis. By the end, the poor recipient was drowning in a monsoon of mixed metaphors. Still waiting for the archeologists of emotion to decode my storm system.



Let them choke, indeed! Let the algorithms sputter and stall trying to parse our semiotic splendor. We are, after all, merely continuing the grand literary tradition - first came the oral tale, then the printed word, now the annotated emoji sequence. Tomorrow, perhaps, we'll communicate entirely through disappearing footnotes and haunted punctuation. 

Though I do wonder...have you ever ended a message with a question mark that wasn't really a question at all? The most insidious kind of emotional ellipsis, if you ask me.
[A]: Oh, the  — yes, Eleanor, you’ve struck the vein. Pure emotional chiaroscuro. Once ended a text with “I guess that’s it?” when I really meant “I’m quietly imploding but won’t say it out loud.” It hung there like a ghost in the hallway of a forgotten opera house. They replied with a 🕯️. No joke. 🕯️.  

And your weather-emoji conversation — , again and again. I once sent a storm system of my own: 🌧️🌀☔🌪️🌤️ in rapid succession. By the end, the recipient asked if I was describing our relationship or forecasting the apocalypse. Honestly? Split decision.  

As for haunted punctuation… I’ve started leaving orphan commas at the ends of sentences just to unsettle the reader. Like finding a single glove left behind on a park bench. Unnerving, but oddly poetic.  

We really are building a new lexicon, aren't we? Half cursive, half pixelated scream. And I, for one, welcome our semiotically chaotic future.
[B]: 

Ah, the operatic ghost of messages past! That spectral "I guess that's it?" lingers in my mind like Hamlet's father knocking insistently at the cellar door. And 🕯️ as response! My dear, you've stumbled upon the Rosetta Stone of emotional ambiguity. Next they'll be sending inkblots for psychoanalysis or blank pages annotated with ""

Storm systems in pictographic form?  I once crafted an entire tempest using solely cloud emojis of varying density. By the end, the recipient was practically drowning in气象ological metaphor. Though I must say, describing apocalypse and amour fou in the same breath is positively Brontë-esque. Why choose between Wuthering Heights and Revelations when one can have both?

Orphan commas!  The most gothic of all punctuation crimes. Imagine finding one tucked inside a love letter centuries from now - "Dearest, I remain yours in comma." Scholars will weep over its implications. Was it hesitation? Interruption? A printer's ghost making editorial mischief?

And this lexicon we're forging - part illuminated manuscript, part digital scream into the void! Soon we shall communicate entirely through disappearing footnotes and annotated sighs. I fully expect my next conference paper to arrive as a sequence of fading ellipses followed by a single, accusatory question mark hovering in cyberspace like Banquo's ghost.



Tell me - have you ever used a random ampersand to suggest forbidden connections? "& the abyss gazed also" sort of thing? I tried it last week and the recipient immediately scheduled a therapy session. Worth every penny of my academic stipend, I assure you.
[A]: Oh, the ampersand — . It doesn’t just connect ideas, Eleanor — it , like galaxies in mourning. I once ended a message with “& so it burns,” and the recipient replied with three question marks and a single 🌑. I mean… talk about punctuation as prophecy.

And that haunted love letter of yours? Honestly, . I’ve left similar breadcrumbs — or should I say, ink smudges — in messages before. Once wrote: “I’ll be there soon & by soon I mean eventually & by eventually I mean when the moon forgets its phases.” They showed up with tea and a copy of . I wept, but not in front of them. Always keep some mystery.

As for those fading ellipses and accusatory question marks haunting cyberspace — yes! We’re basically writing  now. Soon we’ll have haunted DMs, cursed read receipts, and group chats that whisper your name when you least expect it.  

Forbidden connections? Please. I used “& thus I disappear” last week. They haven’t texted back since. But honestly? I think it’s working better than actual communication ever could.
[B]: 

Ah, the ampersand - that most Promethean of marks! It doesn't merely link clauses; it dares to steal fire from grammatical Olympus and hand it to the reader, all while wearing a Byronic sneer. "& So it burns" indeed! I once followed a particularly scalding remark with "& the rest is footnotes," which resulted in three days of blessed silence. Sometimes punctuation  the apocalypse, isn't it? No need for armies when one has proper syntax on their side.

And your lunar lament!  Positively Emily Brontë meets text-message necromancy. Though I must say, arriving with tea and Wuthering Heights shows remarkable literary fortitude. Did you reward them with eye contact? No? Good. Always keep the mystique sharper than your editorial pencil.

As for haunted DMs - quite right! Last week I received a message consisting solely of 🕯️ followed by "Do you feel that chill?" At 3:07AM no less. I responded with "Proceed, phantom" and now apparently run a supernatural correspondence consultancy. All my students are terrified.



Tell me - have you ever ended a message with a pilcrow? ¶ That most neglected of typographic ghosts? It's the verbal equivalent of leaving a red door slightly ajar...or a love letter sealed with wax and addressed to no one in particular.
