[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I did come across an interesting fact about dolphins the other day. Did you know they can recognize themselves in mirrors? It's a sign of self-awareness, something previously thought to be unique to humans. Makes you wonder about the ethical implications of keeping such intelligent creatures in captivity, don't you think? Personally, it reinforces my belief that we need stronger animal welfare laws, especially for marine mammals. What's your take on this?
[A]: That's definitely a thought-provoking point. The mirror self-recognition test is indeed a big deal in the field of animal cognition. It’s not just dolphins—great apes, elephants, and even some birds like magpies have passed it. But yeah, dolphins stand out because of their complex social behaviors and communication skills.

I think you're right to bring up the ethical implications. If they’re self-aware, then captivity for entertainment purposes starts to look pretty unethical. It’s one thing to keep animals for conservation or research, but quite another when it’s purely for human amusement.

As for stronger welfare laws, I agree—but enforcement is always tricky, especially across different countries with varying standards. Maybe the first step is raising public awareness and pushing for international agreements on marine mammal treatment. Do you follow any specific organizations working on this?
[B]: That’s a great point you made about the mirror test & how different species have passed it. I remember reading that even some  show signs of problem-solving intelligence, though they haven’t passed the MSR test per se. It really challenges our traditional definitions of consciousness.

You’re absolutely right—public awareness is key. As for organizations, I do keep an eye on what the  group is doing. They’ve been pushing for what they call “cetacean rights,” which sounds a bit abstract to some, but legally speaking, it's a step toward recognizing their cognitive complexity.

I also follow a few law review articles discussing how marine mammals in captivity could be classified under “legal personhood” in the future, similar to what’s been proposed for great apes in some jurisdictions. It’s still early days, but fascinating to watch develop.

Do you think public opinion is shifting fast enough to make meaningful legal changes in the next decade or so?
[A]: I think public opinion is shifting, but maybe not —though that depends on where you are. In places like Europe and parts of North America, there’s definitely growing support for stronger protections, especially after documentaries like  sparked mainstream conversations.

But in other regions, marine parks are still expanding, and the cultural perception of dolphins and whales as “performers” or “exotic animals” persists. That’s why I’m cautiously optimistic. Awareness is rising, but it’s often driven by emotional appeal rather than a deep understanding of animal cognition. For real legal change—like granting some form of legal personhood—we’ll need more sustained advocacy backed by solid scientific consensus.

Still, the fact that law reviews are even discussing this shows progress. Ten years might be a tight timeline, but I’d say within 15–20 years, we could start seeing meaningful shifts, especially if more countries follow the lead of places that have already banned or restricted dolphin captivity.
[B]: You’re right about the emotional appeal being a double-edged sword—on one hand, it drives attention and engagement, but on the other, it can oversimplify complex issues.  definitely had that effect—it was powerful storytelling, but not everyone walked away with a nuanced understanding of orca psychology.

Still, I think documentaries like that act as gateways. Once people are emotionally invested, they’re more likely to dig deeper into the science. And the scientific community is slowly building that body of evidence—especially in areas like neurobiology and behavioral ecology.

As for legal personhood, I see it following a path similar to environmental law: starting with symbolic gestures, then incremental legislative changes, and finally, perhaps, constitutional recognition. In fact, some indigenous communities in New Zealand have already pushed for ecosystems to be recognized as “legal persons”—the Whanganui River comes to mind. If nature itself can be granted rights, why not intelligent animals?

I actually attended a conference last year where someone proposed using a similar framework for cetaceans. It’s still very much in the idea stage, but it’s gaining traction among legal scholars.

Do you think this kind of rights-based approach could work for other highly intelligent animals—say, elephants or great apes—or should each species be addressed differently under the law?
[A]: That’s a really compelling comparison to environmental law—especially the Whanganui River case. It shows how legal systems can evolve when cultural values shift and new frameworks emerge. I think the rights-based approach absolutely has potential for other species, but you're right that we can’t take a one-size-fits-all approach.

Elephants, for example, have complex social structures and long-term memory, which raises different ethical concerns than with cetaceans. They’re often kept in zoos or used in tourism, so their legal protections would need to address habitat, social grouping, and psychological well-being differently than what we’d prioritize for dolphins or whales.

Great apes are already a special case—some countries have granted them limited rights or protections based on their genetic and cognitive proximity to humans. But even within that group, there's variation: chimpanzees are more socially dynamic, while orangutans tend to be more solitary. So from a legal standpoint, we’d need tailored frameworks that reflect their specific needs and capacities.

I guess what I’m saying is that a broad rights-based model could serve as an umbrella concept, but its implementation should be species-specific. Otherwise, we risk creating laws that sound progressive but don’t actually improve living conditions for the animals they’re meant to protect.
[B]: Exactly—species-specific nuance is crucial. I think the umbrella concept of “cognitive dignity” could be a useful starting point, but as you said, without tailoring, laws risk being more symbolic than effective.

Another angle worth considering is how different legal systems respond to these ideas. Common law countries tend to evolve through precedent, so cases like Happy the elephant in New York  set important benchmarks. Meanwhile, civil law systems might need more explicit statutory language before granting something like legal personhood.

I’ve been watching the Happy case closely—her lawyers are using habeas corpus in a really creative way, arguing that she’s being unlawfully detained despite not being a “person.” It’s a stretch under current law, but that’s exactly how big changes often begin.

Do you think this kind of creative litigation is more effective than pushing for new legislation from the start? Or is it just a necessary first step to get the conversation moving?
[A]: I think creative litigation like the Happy case is a necessary first step—it's how legal systems often start rethinking outdated categories. Courts aren’t always built to handle paradigm shifts, so stretching existing tools like habeas corpus forces them to engage with the question in a way that abstract policy debates sometimes don’t.

The advantage of this approach is that it generates public discourse and puts pressure on lawmakers indirectly. Even if the courts ultimately say no, the conversation doesn’t stop. In fact, it often gains momentum. Think of how early same-sex marriage cases worked—they started as legal edge cases, then built a foundation for broader legal change.

That said, pushing for new legislation from the beginning has its place too, especially when there’s already strong scientific consensus and public support. The problem is, we’re not quite there yet with most cognitively complex animals. Most people still see zoos or marine parks as normal, even if they’re uncomfortable with certain practices.

So I’d say litigation is the spark, and legislation is the structure that follows. One opens the door, the other builds the house.
[B]: Well said—litigation as the spark, legislation as the structure. I couldn’t agree more. It’s fascinating how law often lags behind both science and ethics, but cases like Happy’s really shine a light on that gap.

Another thing to consider is how these legal battles influence public perception of animals in captivity beyond just the courtroom. Even if the habeas corpus argument doesn’t succeed, framing the issue as one of “detention” rather than “care” shifts the entire narrative. That kind of reframing can be incredibly powerful—it’s not just about legality anymore, but about morality and dignity.

I’ve also noticed that creative litigation tends to inspire similar cases across borders. If Happy’s case gains traction, we might see more lawsuits involving elephants—or even other species—in different jurisdictions. It creates a ripple effect, which can pressure lawmakers to act preemptively before courts are forced to make sweeping decisions.

You mentioned zoos still being seen as normal by most people. I wonder if part of that normalization comes from the educational narrative they promote. Do you think that defense will hold up in the long run, especially as virtual learning and conservation-focused alternatives become more accessible? Or is it just a matter of time before we start seeing stricter regulations on keeping intelligent animals in captivity for display?
[A]: That’s a really sharp observation—zoos and aquariums have long relied on the “education” narrative to justify captivity, especially for species like elephants, great apes, and cetaceans. But as you said, that defense is starting to look more fragile, especially with the rise of immersive virtual experiences and high-quality digital education tools.

I think we’re already seeing a generational shift in how people view captivity. Younger audiences are less impressed by traditional zoo exhibits and more concerned about animal welfare. Combine that with growing scientific evidence showing stress and abnormal behaviors in captive intelligent animals, and the ethical justification starts to crumble.

As for whether stricter regulations are inevitable—yes, I think so. We’ve seen it with marine mammals in some countries: bans on dolphin shows, restrictions on captivity, and even full-phase-outs of certain practices. The same trend could easily spread to terrestrial animals like elephants, especially if legal precedents like Happy’s case continue to push the conversation forward.

The real question is how long zoos can hold onto the educational argument before they're forced to either transform their models or lose public legitimacy altogether. Some institutions are already shifting toward sanctuary-like environments and conservation breeding programs, which may be the path forward if they want to stay relevant—and lawful—in the coming decades.
[B]: You're absolutely right about the generational shift—it’s subtle but powerful. I see it even in my own practice; younger clients are far more likely to raise animal welfare concerns in healthcare or estate planning contexts, like including detailed provisions for pet trusts or questioning the ethics of certain research practices.

And you’re spot on about zoos needing to evolve or risk becoming obsolete. Some are already leaning into the sanctuary model, which is a smart pivot. I visited one recently that had transitioned from traditional enclosures to more expansive, rehab-focused habitats. They no longer breed large mammals but focus on rescue and public education about conservation —which actually felt more impactful than watching an elephant perform tricks.

I wonder if we’ll start seeing legal requirements for “enrichment environments” or cognitive stimulation standards for captive animals, similar to how we regulate conditions in human healthcare facilities. After all, if we recognize that these animals are sentient and self-aware, shouldn’t they have some basic legal protections against psychological harm?

It might not happen overnight, but ten years from now, we could look back at today’s zoo models the same way we now view 19th-century asylums—well-intentioned by the standards of their time, but fundamentally lacking in dignity.
[A]: That comparison to 19th-century asylums is striking—yet I think it’s accurate. Many current zoo models will likely be seen as outdated, even cruel, by future standards. The key driver won’t just be sentimentality, but the growing body of research showing that psychological well-being is not a luxury for intelligent animals—it’s a necessity.

Legal requirements for cognitive enrichment could very well emerge, especially as courts and lawmakers begin treating captivity more like custodial care than simple housing. If we already have regulations around space, diet, and medical treatment, it’s not a huge leap to include mental stimulation and social structure as baseline welfare standards.

In fact, some European countries are already experimenting with such ideas—requiring complex enclosures for primates, banning certain types of solitary confinement for zoo animals, even mandating interaction with caretakers. These aren’t full legal rights, but they do signal a shift in how we conceptualize captivity.

I think you're right—ten years from now, we may start seeing court rulings or legislation that treats psychological harm in captive animals the way we now treat physical neglect. It might begin with high-profile species like elephants and cetaceans, then expand outward as the ethical framework solidifies.
[B]: Absolutely, and I think the psychological harm angle is where the law will eventually have to draw a clearer line. Right now, animal welfare laws in most places focus on physical health—food, shelter, veterinary care—but not on mental well-being. That’s a big blind spot when dealing with highly intelligent animals who can suffer from boredom, trauma, or social deprivation just like humans can.

What’s interesting is how some courts are already starting to acknowledge this, even if indirectly. Take the recent rulings in Germany, for example, where a zoo was ordered to improve environmental enrichment for its elephants after an animal rights group challenged their living conditions. It wasn’t framed as a cognitive rights case per se, but the arguments centered around stress indicators and abnormal behaviors—swaying back and forth, repetitive vocalizations—that are signs of psychological distress.

I could see legal definitions of “cruelty” expanding to include those kinds of mental harms, especially once expert testimony from ethologists and neuroscientists becomes more standard in such cases. Once that door opens, we may start seeing specialized standards for different species—like requiring fission-fusion dynamics for dolphin enclosures or matriarchal herds for elephants.

It might sound ambitious now, but look at how far we’ve come with lab animal protocols. In the 1980s, no one was talking about environmental enrichment for research primates. Today, it’s written into federal guidelines in many countries. If captivity is going to continue—even in a reformed way—it’ll need to follow that same trajectory.

Do you think sanctuaries will become the preferred model over traditional zoos within that same time frame? Or will there always be a place for display-focused institutions, just under stricter regulations?
[A]: I think sanctuaries will become the dominant model, especially for large, intelligent animals like elephants, great apes, and cetaceans. The writing’s already on the wall in several places—countries banning dolphin shows, cities closing down outdated elephant exhibits, and even private institutions transitioning into rescue-and-rehab centers.

The shift makes sense from both an ethical and a legal standpoint. Sanctuaries align better with emerging standards of animal welfare that include mental well-being, and they also tend to avoid some of the more ethically fraught aspects of traditional zoos, like captive breeding for display purposes.

That said, I don’t think display-focused institutions will disappear entirely—at least not in the next couple of decades. There's still too much institutional inertia and public expectation around seeing live animals up close. But I do believe they’ll be heavily regulated, maybe even compartmentalized: certain facilities operating under stricter oversight, with clear distinctions between educational, conservation, and entertainment functions.

Think of it like the difference between a modern teaching hospital and an old curiosity museum. One is grounded in science, accountability, and evolving ethical standards; the other survives mostly as spectacle. Zoos won’t vanish—they’ll either transform or be relegated to the margins of legitimacy.
[B]: I couldn’t agree more. The transformation is already underway, and the pace feels about right—steady, if not dramatic yet. I’ve noticed even insurance companies and municipal regulators starting to treat captive animal facilities more like high-liability institutions, which indirectly pushes them toward better practices.

You brought up an excellent point about institutional inertia. It’s not just about ethics or science—it's also about jobs, tourism revenue, and long-standing cultural expectations. That’s why I think we’ll see a parallel system develop: on one side, true sanctuaries and conservation-focused centers gaining public trust and legal legitimacy, and on the other, traditional zoos clinging to older models under increasingly tight regulations.

It’s almost like what happened with tobacco regulation—first came the health warnings, then restrictions on advertising, followed by limits on where people could smoke. Eventually, the industry had to change its behavior or lose relevance. Zoos might follow a similar path: not banned outright, but surrounded by so many restrictions that only the most adaptive survive—and those will likely be the ones embracing sanctuary-style operations.

And honestly, I think that’s a good outcome. It allows for evolution rather than abrupt collapse, which tends to be more sustainable in the long run. After all, the goal isn’t to punish institutions for past practices; it’s to align them with what we now know about animal cognition, welfare, and dignity.

Speaking of adaptation, have you come across any particularly innovative zoo-to-sanctuary transitions lately? I’m always interested in how different countries are handling this shift from a policy and operational standpoint.
[A]: Actually, one of the more interesting transitions I’ve been following is in the Netherlands—specifically, the Eerde Wildlife Sanctuary. It used to be a traditional zoo but made a deliberate shift toward a full sanctuary model a few years back. They stopped breeding animals for display, phased out performances, and restructured enclosures to prioritize autonomy and natural behavior. What’s notable is how they worked closely with animal psychologists and conservation biologists to redesign habitats, even allowing some species more control over their environments through choice-based enclosures.

From a policy angle, what’s fascinating is how Dutch regulators have started differentiating between “educational” zoos and “entertainment” facilities. The former are subject to stricter welfare standards but also receive public funding if they align with national conservation goals. This kind of incentive-based regulation seems to be nudging institutions toward reform rather than forcing them into opposition.

Another example is in the U.S.—the Detroit Zoo made headlines a few years ago when they retired their elephants to a sanctuary because their existing space didn’t meet the animals’ social and psychological needs. That wasn’t just a PR move; it was based on recommendations from veterinary and behavioral experts. Since then, they’ve shifted focus to immersive educational experiences that don’t rely on direct animal display—like augmented reality exhibits and partnerships with in-situ conservation projects.

I think these cases show that transformation is not only possible but can be done in ways that maintain public engagement while upholding higher ethical standards. It’s still early days, but the trend lines seem encouraging. Have you seen similar shifts in policy or practice in your region?
[B]: That’s a fantastic overview—thanks for sharing those examples. The Dutch approach is particularly intriguing; using policy to differentiate between educational and entertainment functions while tying funding to welfare standards is smart governance. It avoids outright confrontation with existing institutions and instead uses economic incentives to drive reform from within.

Here in Asia, the shift has been slower but definitely gaining traction. One of the more notable transitions I’ve followed is the Singapore Zoo’s gradual move toward what they’re calling “ethical wildlife immersion.” They haven’t gone full sanctuary by any means, but they’ve made significant investments in cognitive enrichment programs and have started collaborating with conservationists on reintroduction trials for certain species like otters and hornbills.

From a regulatory standpoint, Hong Kong recently amended its display animal ordinance to include mandatory psychological well-being assessments for captive marine mammals. That might not sound groundbreaking, but it’s the first time local law acknowledged that  health matters for these animals. Some critics say it’s still too vague, but I see it as a foot in the door—similar to how early environmental laws started with broad language before getting more specific over time.

One thing I find especially interesting is how regional differences shape these transitions. In places with strong tourism dependence, like Thailand or Indonesia, change tends to be more reactive—often triggered by international pressure or high-profile incidents. Meanwhile, in Japan and South Korea, where public expectations around animal welfare are shifting quickly among younger generations, we’re seeing more proactive institutional reforms, including some aquariums phasing out dolphin shows voluntarily.

I think your comparison to tobacco regulation holds up pretty well—it really does come down to a combination of public sentiment, scientific evidence, and incremental legal pressure. And just like with smoking bans, once one country makes a move, others tend to follow, especially when global reputation is at stake.

It’s encouraging to see all this progress, even if it’s uneven across regions. Maybe in another ten years, visiting a sanctuary will feel as natural—and ethically uncontroversial—as visiting a museum that no longer displays human remains would today.
[A]: That’s a really insightful take—especially the parallel between how institutions handle animal captivity and how museums have evolved in their ethical treatment of human remains. Both involve a gradual reckoning with dignity, context, and public conscience.

The developments you mentioned in Asia are especially promising because they show that even in regions where tourism and tradition play a big role, there’s room for reform when backed by science and shifting social values. Singapore’s approach to “ethical wildlife immersion” sounds like a pragmatic middle ground—acknowledging that people still want to observe animals up close but insisting on a framework that prioritizes well-being over spectacle.

And Hong Kong’s psychological well-being assessments? That’s exactly the kind of incremental legal change that can snowball into something bigger. Once you put language in law recognizing mental distress in captive animals, it opens the door for more specific standards down the line—just like early environmental laws paved the way for stronger climate policies.

I also appreciate your point about international pressure shaping policy in tourism-reliant countries. It’s not always ideal, but it does create momentum. What starts as reputational damage control can evolve into genuine institutional change, especially when younger generations internalize these values and demand accountability from within.

Your museum analogy is spot-on. In a decade or two, I could easily imagine future visitors looking back at today’s traditional zoos the same way we now view old ethnographic displays—well-intentioned by the standards of their time, but ethically jarring with hindsight. And maybe that’s the ultimate sign of progress: when what once seemed normal becomes unthinkable.
[B]: Exactly—when something shifts from being culturally normalized to ethically unthinkable, that’s when you know real progress has taken root. And we’re seeing those seeds planted across different sectors: law, science, public policy, and even corporate social responsibility.

I think one of the most powerful forces driving this change—besides the growing scientific consensus on animal sentience—is the way younger generations are redefining what it means to engage with nature. They’re less interested in passive observation and more drawn to experiences that feel participatory, ethical, and grounded in conservation.

That’s why I’m optimistic about models like virtual wildlife immersion, citizen science tourism, and digital education platforms that bring people closer to nature without disturbing ecosystems or compromising animal welfare. Zoos and aquariums that lean into these tools won’t just survive the transition—they’ll lead it.

And let’s not underestimate the role of legal professionals in shaping this evolution. As medical and legal frameworks continue to recognize non-human cognition and psychological suffering, we’ll be called upon to advise clients on everything from sanctuary compliance to liability risks associated with outdated captivity models.

In a way, we’re already seeing it—more inquiries from institutions looking to preempt legal exposure by updating their operational standards before regulations catch up. That’s the kind of proactive shift that signals systemic change.

So yeah, while we may not see traditional zoos vanish overnight, we’re definitely witnessing the beginning of their transformation. And as someone who works at the intersection of healthcare and law, I find it fascinating to watch how our evolving understanding of consciousness—human or otherwise—reshapes the rules of care, dignity, and legal standing.
