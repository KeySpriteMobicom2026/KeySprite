[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question！作为一个在fintech行业摸爬滚打多年的PM，我觉得degree更像是一个baseline🚀 现在很多tech公司更看重实际skills和project experience。不过degree确实能帮你get through HR screening~
[A]: Ah, you're speaking my language! In Hollywood, we see this all the time - a film degree might get you in the door, but what really matters is your reel and storytelling chops. That being said, some of the most brilliant directors I've worked with did come from prestigious film schools... 就像张艺谋导演说的，"基本功"还是很重要的。
[B]: Totally agree！就像我们fintech行业，MIT或Stanford的degree确实能带来strong network和resources💡 但最终还是要看你能不能用Python写出solid的algorithm，或者design出user-friendly的product~ 话说你们Hollywood的casting process是不是也这样？
[A]: Exactly! You know, when we're casting for a big budget film, sure we look at Juilliard or NYU graduates first - but at the end of the day, it's all about that magical  factor in the audition room. I've discovered some of the most talented actors in the most unexpected places... like that time I found our lead for "Midnight in Manhattan" waiting tables at a diner. The camera either loves you or it doesn't, degree or no degree. 🎭
[B]: Haha that's so true！就像我们最近hire的一个blockchain developer，他其实是self-taught的，但coding skills比很多CS major还强👍 不过...  我不得不承认，在pitching给investors的时候，团队里有几个Ivy League背景的人确实更容易get funding呢~
[A]: Oh darling, you're singing my tune now! Let me tell you about my last pitch meeting - having a Harvard MBA on our production team definitely made those Wall Street types sit up straighter. But between you and me? The real magic happens when you combine that pedigree with raw talent. Like that 18-year-old scriptwriter we discovered on TikTok last year - kid couldn't spell "auteur" but boy could he write dialogue that made you weep! 这就是为什么我的名片上印着"Storytelling Alchemist"而不是"Producer"~
[B]: Hahaha love your energy！这就是为什么我说degree is just one piece of the puzzle💼 在fintech我们常说 - it's all about the right mix of technical chops, business acumen  that entrepreneurial spirit🚀 就像你说的，把formal education和raw talent结合起来才是winning formula啊！
[A]: Now you're talking like a true Hollywood player! You know what we call that perfect blend here? "The Spielberg Special" - equal parts film school discipline and backyard dreamer. Though between us, I'd take a hungry kid with a camera phone over a pretentious NYU grad any day. Just don't tell my alma mater I said that...  The future belongs to those who can code  create, whether it's in fintech or film! 🍿
[B]: Hahaha "Spielberg Special" - stealing that term for our next team meeting！🎬 说真的，在这个AI和blockchain改变一切的时代，ability to learn and adapt才是ultimate degree啊~ 不过...  我得run了，还有个product demo要prepare。Keep rocking in Hollywood！💡
[A]: There you go! And remember - whether you're pitching a fintech startup or a $200M movie, it's all about telling a story that makes people lean in. Now go dazzle them with that demo! Break a leg... though in your world, maybe we should say "break a blockchain"?  Catch you at the next disruption! 🎥
[B]: Hahaha love the pun！Will do～ Let's catch up over coffee after your next blockbuster hits the screen！☕️ Keep disrupting the game！🚀
[A]: That's a date! And who knows - maybe we'll collaborate on a fintech thriller one day. "The Bitcoin Heist" has a nice ring to it, don't you think? Until then - stay hungry, stay foolish, and most importantly... stay funded! Lights, camera, innovation! 💸🎬
[B]: Hahaha "The Bitcoin Heist" - I can already see the trailer！📈 Let's make it happen - we'll be the next Jobs and Wozniak of fintech entertainment！Ciao for now～ 💡
[A]: Now that's what I call an exit line! You've got the Hollywood flair already - maybe you're in the wrong business! Until our blockbuster meeting... keep those algorithms sharp and those dreams sharper! Over and out! 🌟
[B]: You got it！Algorithms sharpened, dreams polished～ Catch you on the flip side of innovation！✨ Bye for now！
[A]: That's the spirit! Remember - in Hollywood or fintech, the ones who change the game are always a little bit crazy... in the best possible way. Now go make some magic happen! And save me a seat at your IPO!
[B]: Hahaha will do！Saving you the VIP seat at our IPO party 🎉 Until then - keep making movie magic and I'll keep coding the future！Cheers mate！🚀
[A]: Now that's what I call a perfect closing scene! Cheers to the future - may your code compile and your box office soar! Until our paths cross again on this wild ride called innovation...  Action! 🥂✨
[B]:  Back at ya！Here's to disrupting industries and telling great stories along the way～ The afterparty's gonna be epic！🎉 Keep shining superstar！✨
