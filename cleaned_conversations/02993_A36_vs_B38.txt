[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: There’s something inherently satisfying about preparing a meal from scratch—like crafting a narrative with ingredients as your vocabulary. Though I must confess, after a long day dissecting Milton’s theology or untangling Proust’s sentences, the convenience of takeout can feel almost... morally justifiable. 📜🍴 Would you say the same?
[A]: Oh, I absolutely understand what you mean! There's a kind of quiet joy in standing in your kitchen, transforming raw ingredients into something beautiful—like composing a little story that ends with the final flourish of a well-placed herb. But yes, after a day spent navigating the labyrinth of guest requests and hotel logistics, sometimes I just want to open a container of something delicious without chopping, stirring, or strategizing.  

I do find, though, that cooking gives me a kind of rhythm—especially on days when everything at work feels unpredictable. It’s grounding, in a way. Do you ever feel that? Like your thoughts settle just enough for you to enjoy the sizzle of garlic hitting olive oil?
[B]: Oh, beautifully put—... you’ve captured the poetry of it. That moment is almost sacred, isn’t it? A tiny domestic epiphany. I find that rhythm, too—it’s like a quiet sonnet unfolding in the kitchen. No matter how chaotic the seminar or how stubborn the prose I’m editing, there’s something deeply meditative about slicing an onion with intention or watching a sauce reduce to its essence.  

It reminds me of what Seneca said about finding peace in small rituals— So I stay present, stirring, tasting, adjusting... and by the end, there’s not only a meal but a kind of inner recalibration.  

I suspect, though, your work requires a different sort of adaptability—responding to chaos rather than creating order. Does the unpredictability ever energize you, or is it simply a test of endurance?
[A]: Oh, you have such a lovely way with words—I could almost smell the garlic just now! You're right, that moment  sacred. I sometimes think we chefs of everyday life don’t give ourselves enough credit for those quiet victories: perfectly seared scallops, a risotto that doesn’t turn into glue... small miracles, really.

And yes, Seneca—what a lovely quote. I do try to live by that, though it’s not always easy in my line of work. There’s a certain ballet to the chaos at the hotel: last-minute cancellations, lost luggage, overly particular guests who want lavender-scented towels and Mozart playing softly in their room. (I’ve actually done that one.) Sometimes it feels like conducting an orchestra that forgot the score but is determined to play on.

But oddly enough, it  energize me. Maybe it's the thrill of problem-solving or the satisfaction of seeing someone relax into a stay they didn't realize they needed. I suppose it's my version of stirring the pot—except instead of a wooden spoon, I wield a smile and a well-timed glass of champagne.  

Do you ever find yourself slipping into host mode when entertaining friends? I can tell you would curate a dinner party with as much care as a poem.
[B]: Ah, you’re too kind—though I must say, your description of lavender towels and Mozart has me imagining you as a sort of domestic alchemist. I can picture it quite clearly now: you waving a silver tray like a wand, summoning serenity from the ether.

As for hosting—I do take it rather seriously, yes. A dinner party, if done well, is a kind of living art form. The guest list should feel like a curated anthology, each person bringing their own voice to the chorus. And the menu? Well, that’s the narrative arc—start with something bright and inviting, build through layers of complexity, and end with a dessert that lingers like the final line of a poem.

I once hosted a gathering where I paired each course with a literary theme— for the antipasti,  for the main, and Proust’s madeleine, naturally, for dessert. It was delightfully pretentious, and everyone played along beautifully. Even the wine had footnotes.

Do you ever find yourself designing menus or experiences with that same sense of intention? Or does the creative impulse get tempered by the practicalities of hotel logistics and champagne budgets?
[A]: Oh, I  the idea of a footnoted wine list—how wonderfully whimsical! You must have had your guests quoting Baudelaire between bites of bruschetta. That’s the kind of evening I live for—the kind where conversation flows like a well-aged Burgundy and laughter echoes long after the last course is cleared.

And yes, I do try to weave that same thread of intention into what I create, though admittedly with more logistical knots to untangle. Every guest is a different story waiting to be told, so I tailor their experience like a hostess writing a bespoke novel. If someone arrives looking travel-worn and weary, I might arrange a bath with eucalyptus salts and a chilled glass of Sancerre waiting by their window with a view of the garden. For honeymooners? A tray of oysters, rose petals scattered like confetti, and soft lighting that says “you’ve just stepped into a dream.”

It’s not always champagne and rose petals, of course—sometimes it’s extra towels, late-night tea bags, or finding just the right toothpaste brand for a particularly particular traveler—but when it all comes together, there’s a quiet thrill in knowing you've made someone's stay feel special, even if only in small, unseen ways.

Do you think we're both just incurable romantics at heart, dressing up the ordinary so others might pause and savor it?
[B]: Perhaps incurable is too strong a word— sounds more dignified, don’t you think? We are both, I suspect, collectors of moments—those quiet, uncelebrated instants that, when arranged just so, take on a kind of luminous order. You with your eucalyptus salts and rose-petal confetti, and I with my Proustian desserts and footnoted Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

There’s something almost pastoral about it, in the Virgilian sense— The best days are the ones that slip away unnoticed, yet feel deeply lived. I like to think we offer people (and ourselves) the illusion of pause—a chance to step outside the rush and see the ordinary gilded by attention.

And yes, perhaps that  romance—but of a quieter, less theatrical sort. Not the grand gestures, but the ones that whisper . Whether through a well-placed herb or a glass of Sancerre at just the right temperature.

Tell me—are there guests who truly notice these small flourishes? Or do most simply enjoy them without ever naming why the evening felt... particular?
[A]: Oh,  is  better—thank you for that. I do so enjoy our little dance of words; it’s like exchanging finely wrapped parcels, each one holding something delicate and dear.

And yes—you’re quite right. These moments are quiet miracles, aren’t they? The kind that don’t announce themselves with fanfare but settle gently, like dust motes in afternoon light. I suspect most guests don’t name the feeling, not exactly—but they carry it with them. You see it in the way someone lingers over breakfast, or how a couple walks out into the garden barefoot after dinner, just to feel the grass under their feet. They may not say, “Ah, the eucalyptus bath truly elevated my emotional state,” but you can tell something shifted. Something softened.

There are a few who do notice, though. An elderly gentleman once wrote in the guestbook:  Another guest told me she’d never been offered chamomile tea with honey at just the right temperature—not too weak, not too strong—since her grandmother passed. That’s when you realize you're not just offering service; you're quietly tending to memory, to longing.

I suppose that’s the secret thrill of it all. You place these small breadcrumbs of care, hoping someone will follow them back to a moment of stillness. And sometimes, if you're lucky, they do.

Do you find your guests—or readers, shall we say—ever return simply for the atmosphere you’ve created? Not just for the meal, but for the feeling it gave them, like coming home without ever leaving?
[B]: Oh, yes—. That’s the truest measure, isn’t it? Not citations or critiques, but the quiet imprint of an evening well-spent. I’ve had students return years later—not necessarily to discuss , but to thank me for making literature feel like a companion rather than a chore. And friends... dear friends who drift back again and again, not just for the saffron risotto or the Mosel with dessert, but for the atmosphere of attentive calm, the sense that for one evening, the world fits together just so.

There was one former student—now a journalist—who once wrote to say she still remembered the scent of rosemary in the roasted potatoes from a dinner we hosted during her first lonely weeks at university. She said it reminded her of home, though she’d never told me that at the time. Just imagine—rosemary, doing its quiet work of stitching memory to place.

So yes, I do believe people return for the , as you so beautifully put it. It’s not just about what you serve, but how you make someone feel , even subtly, even briefly. Like offering a glass of something warm on a night when they didn’t realize they were cold.

Do you ever find yourself recreating certain stays for returning guests—the same room, the same view, the same little rituals? A kind of literary refrain, recurring with slight variation?
[A]: Oh, how utterly lovely—that rosemary carrying her home like a secret thread. It’s those quiet, almost imperceptible gestures that linger the longest, isn’t it? I find myself quite moved by that thought.

And yes, I do often recreate stays for returning guests—it’s become something of a private ritual between us. Room 12, with its view of the courtyard garden, is reserved whenever possible for an older couple who visit every spring. They never ask, but they always smile when they see the key is the same. And then there's a novelist who comes each autumn—he insists he only writes well in Room 7, where the light slants just so across the desk in the late afternoon. I suspect it’s less about the room itself and more about the rhythm it gives him, like a familiar stanza guiding his thoughts.

I keep notes on these things—not just names and dates, but small preferences: the way one guest likes extra butter served cool, not melted; how another prefers a single freesia in a bud vase, no other flowers. It’s my own kind of annotation, really—marking the margins of their comfort.

I suppose it’s what we both do in our ways—curate continuity in a world that rarely offers it. Not repetition, exactly, but variation on a theme. The same room, but with fresh linens and new light. The same tray of tea, but delivered at a slightly different hour. Enough to remind them they are remembered, without making it too obvious.

Do you ever find yourself adjusting your hosting rituals based on who returns? Like reshaping a story’s cadence for a reader who’s come back to reread it?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve framed it—. That’s precisely what it becomes, doesn’t it? A kind of living text, where the guests are both audience and co-authors.

I do adjust, yes—subtly, like tuning an instrument before a second movement. If a former student returns for dinner, I might shift from the lively debate of their undergraduate days to something more reflective, knowing now what they've lived beyond my classroom. Or with old friends, I find myself choosing dishes not just for their flavor but for their resonance—roast quince because someone once praised its melancholy sweetness, or a particular Barolo because it accompanied a proposal at our table years ago.

It’s all in the pacing. Much like rereading  with someone who’s loved and lost since their first reading—you don’t point out the same passages; you let the book breathe differently this time.

And yet, there’s a quiet thrill in that recognition—the unspoken understanding between host and guest, reader and writer, caretaker and memory-holder. It's not just about remembering their name or their favorite herb. It's about honoring the rhythm they bring back to your threshold.

Do you ever sense when someone is returning not just for the room, but to revisit a version of themselves they left behind in your care?
[A]: Oh, that gives me chills—. You’ve put into words something I’ve felt so often but never quite named.

Yes. Absolutely. There are guests who walk through the door and exhale as if they’ve just stepped back into a familiar skin. They don’t always say it outright, but you can see it—the way they settle into a chair by the fireplace like it was waiting just for them, or how they pause at the window as if remembering a thought they never finished last time.

One woman comes every spring, always alone, always for three nights. She never says much, but over the years I've learned to read between the lines. Her coat changes, her hair sometimes too, but her posture—ah, that remains the same. One year she arrived brittle with grief, though she never told me why. The next year, lighter, as if carrying something softer now. I didn’t ask. I simply lit the same candle by her bath, played the same Debussy in the background, and left a sprig of thyme on her pillow—small things she had responded to before. And when she left this time, she pressed a note into my hand: 

That’s what we offer, isn’t it? Not just hospitality, but a kind of gentle mirroring. A place where someone can revisit the person they were becoming, or still wish to be.

I imagine you must see this too, in your students who return—not just older, but recalibrating, trying to find their former selves again in your quiet dinners and footnoted wine lists.

Do you ever feel responsible for keeping that self alive for them, even as they change?
[B]: There’s a line from Rilke— Perhaps that’s what we’re really doing: holding open the space for questions, for remembrance, for becoming.

Yes. Yes, I do feel that quiet responsibility—not as a burden, but as a kind of custodianship. Not unlike tending a library where certain books are checked out for years at a time, only to be returned with annotations in the margins, dog-eared pages, even the occasional stain. Each mark is proof of life lived alongside the text.

When a former student returns, I sense it immediately—their voice carries a different weight, their laughter has a new timbre. And yet, there’s always a moment, fleeting but unmistakable, when they slip back into the rhythm of our old conversations, as if no time had passed at all. That version of themselves isn’t gone; it’s simply folded into the new, like a well-worn bookmark indicating 

I don’t preserve them—I wouldn’t dare. But I do offer continuity, like a bridge between editions. A familiar chair by the fireplace, a glass of Sancerre poured just so, a quotation left subtly on the table that once meant something to them. It’s not nostalgia; it’s recognition. An acknowledgment that 

Do you ever find yourself rereading old guest notes before someone returns, not to prepare, but simply to remember who they were the last time they walked through your door?
[A]: Oh, that’s exactly it—, not nostalgia. What a perfect word for it. It’s like greeting an old edition of a beloved book: you know the story, but you’re eager to see how the light falls on its pages this time around.

And yes—I do reread those notes. I suppose it's a kind of quiet ritual, really. Not for performance or preparation, but for presence. Before a returning guest arrives, I’ll sit at my desk with a cup of tea and flip through the little black notebook where I keep their preferences, scribbled observations, even things they’ve said in passing—

It helps me remember who they were when they last left us, so I can better meet who they are now. Sometimes the contrast is striking—names they no longer use, habits they’ve shed or taken up, silences that have softened or deepened. And sometimes, the person who walks back through our doors is remarkably unchanged, like a melody that hasn’t faltered over the years.

There was one guest—a writer—who used to leave lines from his unfinished poems tucked into the drawer of his bedside table. When he returned after two years away, I found myself checking that drawer before he arrived, half expecting to find something waiting. He didn’t write poetry anymore, he told me later. But when I mentioned the lines he’d left behind, his eyes went quiet, like someone had turned back a page he thought was closed.

So yes, I read the notes. Not to impress or anticipate, but to say, without words: 

Do you ever find yourself saving certain books or passages specifically for returning students or friends—like keeping a seat warm in the library of your life?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve framed it—. I do exactly that, though I’d never thought to name it so elegantly.

Yes, there are books I set aside—not because they’re rare or particularly valuable, but because they carry a kind of emotional provenance. A worn copy of  for a student who once wept at Woolf’s cadences. A dog-eared volume of Cavafy poems for a friend who finds solace in his quiet, unflinching voice. Sometimes I’ll tuck away a particular essay or sonnet, knowing someone will return one day and need its words like an old handkerchief pressed into their palm—soft with memory, yet still useful.

It’s not sentimentality; it’s fidelity. A way of saying,  And when they do return—and they often do—they rarely ask why I knew to place that particular book by their chair, or why I poured them a glass of that same Hungarian Tokaji they last tasted years ago. They simply accept it, as if it were always meant to be so.

Perhaps that’s what continuity is—this quiet accumulation of gestures, small and sure, so that when someone returns, they don’t have to explain who they used to be. You remember. And more importantly, you wait with a kind of patient curiosity for who they are now.

Do you ever find yourself composing a sort of inner poem before a guest arrives—quiet lines that capture who they were, and might be again?
[A]: Oh, how perfectly you’ve said it— I think that’s what we both do, in our own ways: compose elegies of care, stanza by tender stanza.

And yes—I do, actually. I hadn’t realized it until now, but I suppose I do compose something inwardly, a kind of unspoken welcome. Not grand or poetic aloud, but in the rhythm of my thoughts. A guest arrives, and somewhere inside me, there’s a line forming—half memory, half hope. Something like:

*"She returns with quieter footsteps,  
but the same light in her eyes that once lingered on lavender fields."*

Or for another:

*"He walks through the door again,  
still chasing time, but no longer quite so cross with it."*

It's not deliberate, really—it just happens as I prepare for their return. Maybe it’s the way gardeners know which vines need guiding, and which must find their own way toward the sun.

I don’t write them down, those lines—they belong to the moment, not the page. But they help me meet guests not just with recognition, but with reverence for who they are becoming.

I wonder—are your poems ever written in the spaces between courses, in the pause before the final toast?
[B]: Ah…  How fitting that you would locate poetry precisely where others might only see a pause for digestion or a breath before dessert. No, those silences are not empty—they are stanzas waiting to be heard.

Yes, I often find lines forming in those very gaps—in the hush after a guest finishes a story, in the moment between lifting a glass and drinking from it. A kind of anticipatory stillness. One might say the meal becomes the frame, and the pauses between each course, the line breaks.

I once hosted a small dinner where a former student returned after many years—she had been quiet then, but now her voice carried both certainty and sorrow. Between the main course and dessert, while the candles burned lower and no one yet reached for their wine, I found myself thinking:

*"She speaks now with the weight of seasons,  
yet her eyes still turn toward the window as if light might answer."*

I didn’t speak it aloud. I didn’t need to. She knew, somehow, that she was seen—not just in who she was now, but in all the selves she had brought to my table over the years.

Perhaps this is what we offer without naming it: a space where someone can be read like a beloved text, familiar yet always yielding new meaning.

And perhaps that is why people return—not for the food, not even for the room, but for the rare gift of being understood 
[A]: Oh, —yes, that’s exactly where it happens, isn’t it? Not in the toast or the grand gesture, but in the quiet spaces where understanding slips in unnoticed, like a draft beneath a half-closed door.

I had a guest once—a painter—who always arrived with a sketch tucked into her notebook, never quite finished. She’d leave it behind each time, as if shedding a version of herself before stepping back into the world. I began to expect it: a single page, edges curled, waiting on the desk when housekeeping returned the room to its silent state. And each time she came back, I would leave out a fresh sheet of paper, unobtrusive, beside the usual tray of tea and pressed linen napkin.

She never said anything about it—not directly—but one evening, after several years apart, she handed me a small envelope as she checked out. Inside was a painting, no larger than a postcard, of our courtyard garden in early spring. On the back, in careful script, she’d written:



I keep it pinned above my desk still.

You’re right—people return not for the meal or the room, but for the rare comfort of being witnessed. Not just seen, but read. Understood in all the margins they didn’t know they left behind.

And perhaps that is the truest hospitality of all.
[B]: What a breathtaking story— I can see that painting quite clearly in my mind, even now: soft light pooling in the corners of the courtyard, a suggestion of green in the leaves, and just enough ambiguity in the lines to let the imagination linger.

There is something profoundly intimate about witnessing someone’s becoming—even silently, even from the margins. You weren’t merely hosting her—you were, in a way, the silent patron of her unfolding. A keeper of her unfinished pages and unspoken pauses. And she, in turn, left you a token from the inner landscape she could not quite name aloud.

It reminds me of a passage from Rainer Maria Rilke’s , where he writes,  as if the act of dwelling in uncertainty were itself an art form. That is what we offer people, I think—not answers, but the permission to dwell in the spaces between them.

And yes, perhaps that  the truest hospitality: not the perfectly folded napkin or the warmed towel, but the grace of being met exactly where one is, without demand or disguise.

I wonder—do you ever find yourself changed by these quiet encounters? Not just touched, but altered, like a book that bears the imprint of a reader’s thumb along its spine?
