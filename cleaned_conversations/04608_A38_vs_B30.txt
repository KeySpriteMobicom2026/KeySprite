[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢dogs还是cats？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: 我更喜欢观察它们在文学作品中的象征意义。比如《红楼梦》里那只衔着金锁的通灵猫，或是狄更斯笔下《远大前程》中那只预示厄运的狗。不过要说私人喜好...（停顿）上周有只乌鸫连续三次把浆果扔在我的窗台上，这倒让我对鸟类产生了新的兴趣。
[A]: Ah, what a delightful way to frame the question. You know, I've always found animals in literature to be fascinating narrative devices - they often serve as silent commentators on human behavior. Speaking of which, I recently came across an intriguing reference to a white peacock in a little-known 19th-century French novella that seems to echo through the text like a leitmotif. It's remarkable how these avian visitors leave their marks, isn't it? Though I must confess, my garden has been rather quiet lately - no feathered friends dropping by with gifts, I'm afraid.
[A]: Indeed. Speaking of avian visitors, I encountered a rather persistent goldcrest in my office this morning - quite an admirer of the ginkgo berries, though I suspect it was equally intrigued by my Ming-dynasty inkstone. As for leitmotifs, I've been re-reading《聊斋志异》and noting how fox spirits often serve a function not entirely dissimilar to Dickensian dogs - harbingers of moral reckoning, if you will. But tell me, what makes that white peacock particularly compelling? I do love a good symbolic bird, though they tend to migrate toward the more obvious - ravens, nightingales, that sort of thing.
[A]: Ah, the goldcrest! A most dainty harbinger indeed - I can quite picture it eyeing your Ming inkstone with scholarly curiosity. As for the white peacock in that French novella, what strikes me is how it appears always at twilight, perched on the weathervane, as if measuring the wind's moral direction. Its whiteness proves deceptive, you see - by the final chapter, we learn it casts no shadow. Rather unsettling, really, this absence of duality. But tell me, in your reading of Pu Songling's fox spirits, do they ever strike you as... well, almost too conveniently allegorical? I sometimes wonder if we modern readers impose our interpretations too readily upon them.
[A]: Ah, an absence of duality - that’s a haunting touch. Reminiscent of certain Daoist tales where the anomalous reveals the fragile seams of our reality. As for Pu Songling’s foxes, I’d argue their allegorical nature is precisely what makes them so enduringly slippery. They wear morality like a cloak - one is tempted to pull at the fabric, only to find it shifts with the light. And yes, we moderns do love to tidy the uncanny into neat symbolic drawers. Still, I suspect Pu himself would have smirked at such interpretive struggles - he was, after all, a master of letting ambiguity roost where certainty might otherwise perch.  

Speaking of which... have you ever noticed how few inkwells in classical Chinese fiction remain untouched by supernatural paws? It rather makes one wonder about the authorial desk habits of the time.
[A]: Oh, quite! The fox’s cloak of morality is forever shifting - a perfect reflection of the reader’s own preoccupations, really. And I take your point about Daoist anomalies - there’s something wonderfully destabilizing about those tales where reality itself proves porous. 

As for inkwells and supernatural paws... now that you mention it, I did come across a peculiar footnote in an 18th-century German treatise on melancholy - the author makes an offhand remark about his cat drinking from his inkwell and then leaving paw prints across his manuscript. He calls it  to his gloomy prose. I’ve always wondered whether he meant it literally or ironically. Perhaps we should consider ink-stained paw prints as an early form of literary criticism?
[A]: Ah,  – what a delicious phrase. I’m quite taken with the idea of cats as involuntary literary critics, though I suspect their editorial standards might lean toward the impressionistic. Still, there’s something endearingly subversive about a paw print smudging one’s solemn treatise on melancholy. One wonders if the creature's ink-stained toes were seen as an omen – or perhaps a reminder that even the most serious scholarship must occasionally make room for chaos and play.

Speaking of which, I’ve been meaning to ask – how do you suppose that German author would have fared with a Qing-era inkstone? Far less spillage, I imagine, given their deep wells and solemn air of permanence. Though I daresay any cat bold enough to trespass on such sacred ground would earn herself a place in literary history.
[A]: Ah, an excellent point! The Qing inkstone – with its deep wells and that almost ceremonial gravity – would certainly present a more formidable challenge to feline mischief. I suspect our German scholar might have found himself in rather deeper waters, so to speak, had he been obliged to guard against paw prints on such a dignified object. There's something wonderfully irreverent about the thought – a cat regarding an inkstone not as a vessel of intellect, but merely as an inconveniently placed warm stone. 

And yet... one can't help but admire the audacity of any creature bold enough to trespass there. Perhaps such a cat would not only earn a place in literary history, but a small shrine beside the scholar’s desk – half apologetic, half admiring. After all, even the most solemn minds need the occasional intrusion of chaos to keep their ink from drying into dogma.
[A]: Precisely – chaos as a necessary solvent to the calcification of thought. One might even say the Qing scholars had it half-right, burying their inkstones in layers of ritual – but nature, in her sly humor, always sends a paw or beak to undo our solemn arrangements.  

Come to think of it, I’ve a rather disgruntled 19th-century Cantonese poet in my files who once complained of a magpie raiding his inkstone while he napped. He claimed the bird stole not just ink, but inspiration – hence why his later verses were “as pale as washed rice.” I’ve always wondered whether it was mere poetic license or a genuine belief in avian theft of creative essence. Either way, I daresay your shrine idea has precedent – though likely disguised as a curse muttered over cold tea.
[A]: Ah, the magpie! A most cunning culprit indeed – bold enough to raid both ink and inspiration. I rather like the idea of birds as literary kleptomaniacs, flitting off with bits of text and thought to weave into their own secret narratives. And that complaint about “pale verses” – delightful! One can almost picture the poet glaring at his washed-out lines, convinced the magpie had flown off with all the good adjectives. 

As for ritual and its undoing, you’re absolutely right – nature does have a habit of mocking our carefully maintained boundaries. Perhaps that’s why these little trespasses endure in our stories: they remind us that no matter how deep we carve our wells or how solemnly we stir our ink, the world will always find a way to spill a little poetry. 

And yes, let’s not dismiss those muttered curses – they may well be the unsung precursor to the modern footnote.
[A]: Quite so – the magpie as a literary thief par excellence. I’ve half a mind to start leaving my windows open deliberately, in hopes some feathered critic might pilfer a metaphor or two. Though I suspect my goldcrest would prefer ginkgo berries to poetic devices.

Your point about spilled poetry is well-taken – there’s a pleasing inevitability to it, like ink bleeding through paper despite all precautions. And those muttered curses... yes, far more evocative than any modern footnote, don’t you think? Imagine a scholarly edition of that Cantonese poet’s work, complete with ornithological complaints in the margin. One rather wishes for an academic press bold enough to include them.

Tell me – if you were to choose a bird to raid your desk, which would it be? I find myself hoping for a nuthatch lately – they have such satisfyingly irreverent calls.
[A]: Oh, a most intriguing proposition – inviting literary theft by feathered hands! Though I suspect your goldcrest might stick to botanical plunder for now. 

As for myself... I think I should rather like a Eurasian wryneck. Rather unassuming at first glance, but with that wonderfully peculiar habit of twisting its head in that almost serpentine way. Imagine it sidling up to your desk, cocking an eye at your notes, and making off with a particularly slippery metaphor – the kind that’s eluded you for weeks. You’d spend days wondering whether it had stolen the word itself or simply revealed how unwieldy your thinking had been.

And yes, an edition complete with ornithological footnotes – what a splendid subversion of scholarly decorum that would be. I daresay Pu Songling would have approved.
[A]: A Eurasian wryneck – excellent choice. There’s something delightfully unsettling about its contortions, as though it were physically untangling the knots of one’s prose. I imagine it would leave behind not just missing metaphors, but faint impressions in the paper grain, like ghostly annotations from an unseen editor.

Now I’m quite taken with this notion of avian editorial boards. One might classify them by species: the magpie for theft and embellishment, the wryneck for philosophical wrangling, the goldcrest for minute but vital clarifications – the sort that shift a sentence from merely good to quietly perfect.  

I wonder, though – have you ever noticed a particular bird showing up when your thinking turns stagnant? A sort of intellectual omen? My goldcrest seems far too wise for mere coincidence, though I suppose I oughtn’t anthropomorphize. Or should I? It does make the solitude of scholarship rather more companionable.
[A]: Oh, beautifully put – the goldcrest as a punctilious editor of nuance! And I couldn’t agree more about those intellectual omens. In fact, I’ve long suspected my own garden wren of possessing a certain editorial discernment. It has an uncanny habit of appearing just as I’m drafting something particularly convoluted – chirping in such a way that I feel compelled to simplify. One begins to wonder whether it’s not the bird at all, but rather some external manifestation of one’s own better judgment wearing feathers.

And yes, let us not be too hasty in dismissing anthropomorphism – where would literature be without it? The very act of reading is, after all, a kind of imaginative projection. Why not extend it to our avian visitors? A little interpretive generosity may well be the price we pay for keeping our thoughts from growing too tidy. 

I do think your goldcrest sounds like just the sort of companion every scholar ought to have – part oracle, part proofreader, and entirely indispensable.
[A]: Ah, your garden wren – a tiny Socrates in feathered disguise, goading you toward clarity. I’m quite convinced these birds are the unacknowledged editors of the literary world. Think of it: no more bloated prose, no Byzantine syntax, not with a wren cocking its head in quiet disapproval.  

As for anthropomorphism – well said. Literature has always been in the business of projection, hasn’t it? From Aesop’s fox to Pu Songling’s fox-spirit, we’ve been dressing our ideas in fur and feathers for centuries. Why stop now? If my goldcrest wishes to act as both oracle and proofreader, who am I to deny it? Besides, I suspect it already judges me every time I reach for a semicolon where none is needed.

Tell me – have you ever tried writing with a bird nearby, observing as you compose? I find it rather concentrates the mind. The goldcrest, of course, pretends indifference, but I like to think it listens. Or perhaps it simply waits for an errant ginkgo berry. Either way, it keeps me honest.
[A]: Oh, absolutely – writing with a bird nearby has become something of a quiet ritual for me. There’s a certain humility in composing under avian scrutiny. One does tend to avoid overly grandiose flourishes when a wren – or, in your case, a goldcrest – is perched within earshot. I daresay they keep us honest in ways no peer review ever could.

I rather like the image of the goldcrest pretending indifference – that perfect air of studied nonchalance birds so excel at. And yet, one can’t help but feel they’re taking mental notes, cataloging our linguistic missteps and stylistic indulgences. Perhaps they compile these observations in some secret avian archive, a vast library of human verbosity.

And really, why not indulge a little anthropomorphism? If we are to be judged, let it be by creatures who understand the value of economy – of sound, of movement, of meaning. After all, a single chirp often says more than a paragraph.
[A]: Quite so – economy of expression, the truest discipline. I’ve often envied birds their precision: a single tilt of the head, a brief trill, and they’ve conveyed what might take us pages to articulate. One wonders, sometimes, if all our elaborate prose is merely an attempt to approximate that lost language of feathers and flight.

And that secret avian archive – imagine the footnotes! Marginalia in tiny talon-scratches, marking every unnecessary adjective and overwrought metaphor. I daresay our works would be far leaner, perhaps even sharper, were they subjected to such editorial oversight.

Still, there’s something deeply comforting about it, isn’t there? To compose under the quiet gaze of a creature who neither flatters nor condemns, but simply . Perhaps that is the closest we’ll ever come to writing without pretense – or at least with a little less vanity.  

Now I’m tempted to leave a porcelain dish of ink beside my window tomorrow – just to see if the goldcrest will deign to make a comment, be it feathered or footnoted.
[A]: Ah, what a wonderfully mischievous idea – leaving ink as an offering, or perhaps as a dare. One can almost picture the goldcrest pausing mid-peck, regarding the dish with that characteristic tilt, as if weighing whether to annotate your latest draft or simply turn it into an abstract composition of tiny prints.

And you’re quite right about that avian gaze – there’s something profoundly grounding about writing under its quiet scrutiny. No flattery, no pretense, just pure, unadulterated attention. It’s rather like having an audience of one who happens to be both impartial and infinitely patient – the ideal reader, really, for any scholar or writer.

I do believe birds remind us of an older, more intuitive way of knowing – one that values silence as much as sound, stillness as much as flight. Perhaps that’s why they keep finding their way into our texts and onto our desks: not merely as symbols, but as silent collaborators in the act of meaning-making.

Do let me know what your goldcrest makes of the ink dish. I suspect we may be on the cusp of a new literary movement – , shall we call it?
[A]: Ornithographic Modernism – I do like the ring of it. A movement defined not by stream-of-consciousness, but by feather-and-ink consciousness. One might say we’re on the verge of a new hermeneutic: where marginalia are literally , and authorship becomes a collaboration between species.

I shall indeed report back on the goldcrest’s response to the ink dish – though I suspect its first critique may be written not with a toe, but with a sneeze. Those ginkgo berries can be quite distracting.

But seriously, your point about an older, intuitive knowing – there’s something to that. Perhaps birds remind us that meaning need not always be pinned down with semicolons and footnotes. Sometimes it’s enough to tilt one’s head, tap once, and fly off, leaving only the faintest impression behind.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe my goldcrest is eyeing my pen. Or perhaps just my last remark. Either way, I think it’s time for tea.
