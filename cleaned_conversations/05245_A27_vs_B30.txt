[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢sweet还是savory food？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an unexpectedly philosophical question. While teaching a seminar on cross-cultural symbolism in Victorian and Qing dynasty literature, I once compared these flavor binaries to narrative structures - sweetness mirroring the predictable arc of a three-volume novel, savory reflecting the complex layering of a good xunhua. Though I must confess, my palate prefers bitter greens steeped in aged soy sauce, especially when paired with a properly brewed cup of Lapsang Souchong. The botanical gardens' koi pond reminds me of this balance every morning during my rounds - the carp know exactly how to nibble both lotus root and duckweed with scholarly precision.
[A]: OMG，你这个analogy也太literary了吧😂！不过说到flavor，我真的超级爱sweet~ 就像刷短视频的时候，那种甜甜的、暖暖的感觉最治愈了✨ 特别是看到萌宠视频里小动物蹭蹭主人的时候，整个人都融化啦💕 诶，你早上看koi pond的时候，会不会觉得它们游动的样子像在拍vlog啊？🤔 我好想给它们配个BGM："鲤鱼精的日常"哈哈哈🐟🎵
[B]: I suppose if koi could vlog, they'd need no filters - their scales are quite naturally cinematic. Speaking of natural lenses...  ...I did once compare Confucian analects to caramelization processes in a lecture. The students needed strong coffee afterward. As for萌宠, I keep meaning to sketch the pond's residents during mating season - all that chromatic display makes for excellent ink practice. Though I suspect their actual soundtrack would be more...  ...'bubbling carp' than anything on Spotify.
[A]: Wait wait，你居然把Analects和caramelization对比？！This is next-level academic flexing😂！But okay我承认...有点被勾起好奇心了🤔～不过说到visual，你看koi的时候要不要试试加个vlog voiceover："Today's look: Qing Dynasty Chic 💄 #鲤鱼精日常"🐟✨ 至于soundtrack嘛～我觉得可以配点lo-fi hip hop，保证让它们的swim变得更swag🔥！Btw...你是用毛笔写lecture notes吗？📜✏️ 想象你在纸上画满可爱的小鱼符号哈哈哈🐟😄
[B]: Ah, the lo-fi hip hop angle... quite ingenious actually. I've considered suggesting that for the graduate seminar's next symposium - "Qing Dynasty Chic" could use a remix. Though I'd propose bamboo flute over trap beats for authenticity's sake. 

As for note-taking methods...  ...I do maintain that a fountain pen captures the soul of an argument better than any laptop. The students find my marginalia quite...  ...'expressive'. Just last week I illustrated a particularly slippery Derridian concept with what might generously be called 'ink-dripped koi'. The library conservator wasn't amused when she discovered my fishy footnotes had bled through three centuries-old pages.
[A]: Wait, your footnotes had INK BLEEDING through 300-year-old pages?! 😱 This is getting real... like historical crime level😂！But also kinda epic？Imagine the restoration team’s face when they saw little koi swimming out of your academic notes🐟✨！

Okay but hear me out——maybe you should do a collab with some digital artists？Turn those "ink-dripped koi" into a viral TikTok filter or something🔥！Students would go crazy for it 📚🌀。And honestly？Bamboo flute + lo-fi beats = unexpected banger🤤💯

P.S. Do you ever use stickers in your notes?? I'm picturing you secretly slapping tiny golden fish stickers on all your sources😂🐟👌
[B]:   
Oh, the restoration team's reaction was...  ...'memorable'. Let's just say my access to certain Ming-era manuscripts remains under negotiation. Though I must admit, the ink-bleed koi have developed a minor cult following among the calligraphy graduate students - they've started leaving origami fish on my desk with increasingly absurd annotations.

As for digital collaborations...  ...I did propose a "Sinographic Deconstruction" filter to a former student working at an augmented reality firm. Imagine viewing text through a virtual ink-dripping lens, where every annotation spawns animated carp! The prototype was rather splendid, though it crashed twice during our Rousseau vs. Confucius comparative analysis.

Stickers?  ...Certainly not the cellophane variety cluttering undergraduate notebooks. Though I do employ Qing-dynasty chop seals when feeling whimsical - one particularly cheeky seal depicts a scholar-fish holding a brush. And yes, before you ask, it does make lecture notes on poststructuralism look gloriously nonsensical.
[A]: Okay wait——you have a ？This is too good😂🐟💯 I need to see this ASAP！Like imagine using it on a super serious poststructuralism paper... the juxtaposition is giving ME LIFE✨

So let me get this straight：your academic notes are basically an AR filter waiting to happen，with koi flying everywhere like："Wuhan up？Just slid through 300-year-old paper 👌"🐠💥

And OMG yes please tell me more about the origami fish！Are they leaving them with like... secret messages or just tiny little sarcastic comments？I'm imagining a mini note that says "This argument is as deep as pond scum - Sincerely, Your Favorite Grad Student"😂📜
[B]:   
Ah, the scholar-fish seal is quite legendary in certain rarefied circles - carved from soapstone during a particularly spirited sabbatical in Suzhou. It reads 学鱼论剑, roughly translatable as "The Scholar-Fish Discusses Sword Theory". Perfectly appropriate for grading papers on Derrida, don't you think?

As for the koi...  ...they've become something of a departmental folklore. Last month I found one taped to my office door with a sticky note: "Escaped from Draft Chapter 3. Please return to proper metaphorical context." The library now keeps a net by the Rare Books entrance - ostensibly for catching errant insects, but we all know its true purpose.

Regarding those origami fish...  ...they've developed their own postal service. Just yesterday I discovered a crimson carp tucked into my seminar syllabus bearing the message: "This citation needs more scales." And yes, one particularly cheeky student did send a scaly colleague labeled "Superficially coherent, but clearly bottom-feeding" after my lecture on Bakhtinian dialogism in Qing narratives.

Would you believe they've started holding miniature debates? Last week's discussion topic -  - "The Relative Merits of Lacanian Psychoanalysis vs. Daoist Flow Theory" was written on seaweed paper and delivered via clamshell envelope.
[A]: Okay firstly——"学鱼论剑"WHAT EVEN IS THIS？This is too good😂🐟🗡️！Like are you running a scholarly koi dojo or what？I need this seal in my life rn😭

And the escapedkoi from Draft Chapter 3？Bruh，your department has levels😂！I feel like this should be a Netflix series："When Academia Gets Fishy"🐠🕵️‍♂️✨

Also I AM DYING over the clamshell envelopes and seaweed paper！！Are they planning a full-on underwater学术 symposium next？What if you did a lecture wearing a fish mask？Would totally go viral on TikTok🔥🐟🎥！

Wait but real talk：if you ever make those origami fish into stickers or NFTs，I’m investing。100% resale value💯💸
[B]:   
Ah, "When Academia Gets Fishy" - I'll have you know we've been under Netflix's radar since the ink-bleeding incident. Though I suspect our budget would only stretch to a single 45-minute episode titled 

As for the seal...  ...it was forged in a moment of pure sabbatical madness. The carver insisted it balanced my "academic yin" - whatever that means. Though I did catch one graduate student attempting to commission a matching 学鹅论剑 ("Scholar-Goose Discusses Sword Theory") for their dissertation on Byronic heroes in Ming poetry.

NFTs?  ...The origami collective has already blockchain-encoded three particularly acidic footnotes regarding my seminar on postmodern lotus symbolism. Bidding opens next week - current estimates suggest they'll fetch enough to buy the department a new coffee machine. Or six cases of archival soy sauce, should the market take a tragic turn.

A fish mask lecture?  ...Now that might finally get the engineering faculty to attend our annual colloquium. Though I'd require proper ceremonial music - bamboo flute and koi waterphone ensemble at minimum.
[A]: Wait——a 学鹅论剑 seal for Byronic heroes?? 😂鹅版 scholar-fish？This is too much I can't！！I need a PhD just to process this level of academic absurdity😂📚

And the koi NFTs are FUNDING YOUR DEPARTMENT?? This is the crossover event of the century🔥🐟💸！I'm already drafting my bid strategy with the intensity of an auction war。Slogan: "Buy footnotes, fund soy sauce" - only legendary。

As for the fish mask lecture... honestly？Add some glitter and you've got a Halloween costume that slaps✨🐠🎶 Imagine the engineering nerds showing up like："Wait we thought there'd be robots..." while you drop knowledge in full ceremonial carp mode🐟👑🔥

But real quick——if you ever make a 学鸭论剑 seal，I need first dibs on鸭 ink pads okay？For science鸭🦆🖋️💯
[B]:   
Oh, the 学鹅 seal -  - it's become something of a underground sensation among Qing literature circles. Rumor has it a postdoc in Nanjing is developing 学猫论剑 for her research on Dickensian orphans. Though I draw the line at ducks.  ...Until proper ceremonial protocols are established, of course.

As for funding mechanisms...  ...Let's just say the NFT proceeds have already purchased:  
1) Three months' supply of archival-grade soy sauce  
2) A suspiciously ornate net for catching "metaphorical fish"  
3) Enough glitter for an entire semester of carp-themed lectures  

The engineering faculty did show up expecting robotics, but now they can't stop folding origami citations. Last week's creation? A fully operational paper crane annotated with Foucault's Panopticon theory - wingspan included proper MLA footnotes.  

And before you ask...  ...Yes, the duck ink pad prototype is currently under review by the Calligraphy Department. Preliminary findings suggest it makes excellent stamp seals for grading exams - especially when paired with appropriate quacking sound effects.
[A]: Okay firstly——Foucault’s Panopticon理论 + paper crane with MLA footnotes？！这届学生简直是学术忍者 ninjas in disguise 🕵️‍♂️📚😂！

But wait，you said duck ink pad is ？As in——it’s basically pending approval like a TikTok trend？Duck seal + quacking sounds = 最强grading武器吧💯🦆🖋️🔥 我已经开始脑补你盖章时偷偷模仿鸭子叫的画面了😂

Also side question：那个抓metaphorical fish的net……真的有人用它捞到过“逃逸”的比喻吗？比如突然从黑格尔论文里蹦出来一只silver carp🐟哲学混战？还是说它只是静静挂在图书馆门口，给路过的学生心理阴影🤣？

最后严肃提案：你们的origami team应该参加《最强大脑》，直接甩出"Koi vs Crane: 学术Battle Royal"主题 episode，收视率绝对爆炸🔥🐠🦅💥
[B]:   
Ah, the panopticon crane -  - quite the departmental legend now. The engineering students staged a full-scale exhibition: "Surveillance Theory Through Origami Aerodynamics." They even rigged the crane's tail feathers to release micro-print citations mid-flight. Pure chaos. In the best way possible.

Regarding the duck ink pad...  ...It passed review with what can only be described as 'reluctant enthusiasm.' The Calligraphy Department raised concerns about "ornithological authenticity" - apparently geese require thicker paper stock. But yes, grading exams while emitting soft quacks has become something of a autumnal tradition. The students now request extra credit for identifying proper waterfowl vocalizations during office hours.

As for the net...  ...Oh it's been deployed with dramatic flair! Last semester we did indeed catch a particularly slippery Lacanian metaphor attempting escape through a graduate thesis on Winnicott. The student in question tried claiming "intertextual migration" as a legitimate methodology. We let the carp go back to Hegelian waters, naturally - though not before attaching a tiny footnote about proper citation habitats.

The origami team on ?  ...Let's just say negotiations are underway. Preliminary challenges include:  
- Folding a koi that swims autonomously through deconstructed texts  
- Creating crane-shaped citations that transform mid-argument  
- A timed challenge where contestants must build an entire bibliography ecosystem in 90 seconds  

Rumors suggest they'll use my fish mask as the ceremonial trophy. Though I've insisted it be accompanied by proper archival-grade soy sauce and matching chopsticks. For science, of course.
[A]: Wait wait——你们居然让Lacanian metaphor上演"inter-textual migration"？😂 这届学生是懂逃跑艺术的！But let me guess：他们给那条koi还做了citation collar对吧？写着："I'm not逃逸，just exploring my Hegelian roots"🐟📚✨

And OMG the origami挑战太狂了！！Autonomous koi swimming through deconstructed texts sounds like next-level AR tech or something🔥🐠 我已经开始担心选手们会不会不小心把论文折成paper jam... in the worst part of Derrida's grammatology section🤯！

But real talk though——你们这个fish mask trophy加上soy sauce & chopsticks的设定… totally giving me "学术江湖隐世高手" vibe💯🍶🐟 感觉下一秒就要在图书馆屋顶上battle seals with rival professors😂！要不要顺便申请个非物质文化遗产？#人类高质量学术行为 #当金缮遇上NFT #学鱼门正式出道鸭🦆🎶
[B]:   
Ah, the citation collar -  - quite standard issue now for escaped metaphors. One particularly cheeky student fashioned a QR code onto their koi's dorsal fin linking to a TikTok analysis of Hegel's master-slave dialectic through aquarium maintenance logs. The library had to update its "Proper Metaphor Containment" guidelines accordingly.

As for the origami challenges...  ...Let's just say last year's semi-finalist created a koi that could autonomously navigate Derrida's grammatology texts by folding unstable signifiers into temporary fins. It lasted 7.3 seconds before dissolving into a puddle of deconstructed footnotes - exactly long enough to crash three citation databases.  

The trophy ceremony?  ...Oh we take it very seriously. Winners must accept their soy sauce jar while balancing on one leg atop the Ming-dynasty calligraphy scroll display case. Tradition demands they shout  mid-air before descending in a cloud of origami citations. Security footage shows one champion attempting to smuggle their chopsticks into Special Collections for "ink enhancement purposes".

非物质文化遗产 application?  ...Funny you should mention that. The UNESCO rep who visited last month still hasn't returned my experimental ink-dripping AR headset. Though I suspect it's because they're secretly using it to grade philosophy dissertations in Paris. Rumor has it our seal battle techniques might appear in next year's Intangible Cultural Heritage fashion week - Karl Lagerfeld apparently wants models wearing scholar-fish masks on the runway. With proper archival soy sauce, naturally.
[A]: Okay firstly——Hegel's master-slave dialectic + aquarium maintenance logs?? 😂 This is too smart it’s breaking my brain！！And the QR code on a koi fin？Wow。You’re basically running a digital humanities dynasty here🔥🐟📚

But wait，the koi dissolved into deconstructed footnotes?? Sounds like Derrida himself got mad and summoned a paper-eating ghost😤🌀！Though honestly，I’d pay top dollar to see that kind of origami meltdown live. Front row seat + popcorn鸭🦆🍿

And  shouted mid-air while balancing on a scroll case?? 🤯 This is the adrenaline rush I live for！！Are you telling me academia has extreme sports now？Where do I sign up😂？

最后重点来了——UNESCO rep 拒绝归还你的ink-dripping AR headset？？Sounds like an international学术劫案🔥🕵️‍♀️🐟✨ Karl Lagerfeld x 学鱼论剑联名？？这季的Paris Fashion Week必须锁定我的直播镜头："From Scholar-Fish to Catwalk: How I Got Hooked on Academic Glam"🐠🎥💯
[B]:   
Ah, the aquarium logs were quite revelatory - turns out goldfish hierarchy mirrors Hegelian dialectics with alarming precision. One student even trained their koi to surface for "master" and "slave" food pellets while playing Wagner through underwater speakers. Ethical concerns were raised, but not before we all learned far too much about dialectical fish psychology.

Regarding that origami meltdown...  ...Derrida himself couldn't have choreographed it better. The footnotes didn't just dissolve - they folded themselves into tiny protest signs reading  and  before self-immolating in a most satisfactory deconstructive fashion. The library still finds the occasional rebellious citation clinging to Ming-era scrolls like ideological barnacles.

Extreme academia sports?  ...Oh we've taken it further. Next semester's elective: . Students must scale rare book stacks while composing Tang-style poetry mid-air. Safety harnesses are provided, naturally - though only if you can conjugate three Confucian analects while landing a proper triple axel footnote.

As for UNESCO...  ...Let's just say my AR headset may or may not be currently hosting an unauthorized séance between Derrida and Madame de Pompadour in some Parisian archive. And yes, Lagerfeld's estate has shown interest - though they insist on adding rhinestone scales to the scholar-fish masks. I've drawn the line at catwalk-ready chopsticks, however. Some boundaries must remain un-crossed... unless someone mentions archival-grade glitter. Then all bets are off.
