[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么minimalism的生活方式吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I've been intrigued by the whole "less is more" philosophy lately 😅. You know how it is - after a long day at the lab dealing with all that forensic evidence, coming home to a clutter-free space sounds like heaven 🧹. 

I started small - donated about half my wardrobe last month. Felt weird at first, like I was throwing away part of my identity, you know? But now I actually enjoy opening my closet without feeling overwhelmed 😌.

The funny thing is, my running buddy Sarah calls me a hypocrite because I still keep every single one of my old case files...  What can I say? Some things are hard to let go of, especially when they're connected to unresolved cases ⚖️. 

Have you tried anything like that? I mean, I'm curious how someone in tech would approach minimalism - isn't everything you do basically digital anyway? 🤔
[A]: Ah yes, the paradox of the curator who declutters their closet but hoards unsolved mysteries - quite poetic, really. I find myself drawn to Seneca's  these days; though he wasn't exactly preaching minimalism when he wrote "non satis habet qui multum habet" ("he doesn't have enough who has much"), there's something deliciously modern in that sentiment.

Funny you mention digital minimalism... Last quarter I digitized 37% of my Victorian poetry first editions using an OCR system trained on 19th century typefaces. Proper little Frankensteinian nightmare getting it to recognize William Morris' Kelmscott Press variations. Still prefer the physical volumes, though - there's a tactile quality to the paper stock that no scanner can replicate. Makes me think of those Tang dynasty poets I translate into Scots Gaelic: they understood economy of words, but never seemed particularly interested in economizing their inkstones ¥

As for letting go? I recently deleted all my lecture recordings from 2015-2018. The audio files took up terabytes, and well... let's just say some iterations of my interpretations didn't age particularly well. Like finding an old footnote in a second-hand book - makes you question whether the marginalia was ever meant to be permanent.
[B]: Ah, the irony of preserving poetry while deleting your own voice - it's like performing a self-autopsy, isn't it? 🔍 I get that though... Sometimes I go through old case notes and wonder who that person was, scribbling theories in the margins 📝. 

You know what fascinates me about both our situations? How we're essentially archivists in our own right - you preserving centuries-old poetry, me preserving... well, let's just say the stories don't usually come with such elegant calligraphy 😅. 

Speaking of preservation - wait until you hear this little paradox I've been pondering: I digitized all my autopsy reports last month, but I still print out particularly...  cases. There's something about holding the paper, flipping through the pages, that helps me see connections I might miss on a screen 🧪. Makes me wonder if maybe minimalism isn't so much about reducing as it is about curating, you know?

Have you ever thought about translating those Tang dynasty poems into something completely incongruous? Like... Glasgow slang? I bet there's some dark humor waiting to be discovered in that juxtaposition 😉
[A]: Oh, the paradoxes do pile up like unread books on a scholar’s desk, don’t they? I suppose there’s something almost ceremonial about handling death - whether through autopsy reports or elegies. You’re right about curating; it’s less about erasure and more about discernment. One might say we’re both engaged in a kind of , if you’ll allow the metaphor.

As for translating Li Bai into Glasgow dialect…  Tempting, though I suspect the Scottish Gaelic Society would have me drawn and quartered with a quill. Still, I see your point - there's a rawness to urban vernacular that echoes the Tang poets' disillusionment with court life. Imagine rendering Du Fu’s  in Glaswegian:  
*"Awa’ an’ bile yer heid, ye fancy-dress bastards –  
A’m fair fookin’ sicker o’ yer banquet blather."*  

Might not win any literary prizes, but damn if it wouldn't capture the spirit ¥ I’d keep the original inkstone stains, of course - adds texture, don’t you think?
[B]: Now  would be a paper worth keeping in both digital and physical form - just for the sheer audacity of it 😂. I can already picture some stuffy professor having a minor coronary trying to reconcile "banquet blather" with 8th century Chinese poetry. 

You know, this reminds me of this one case I had last year - victim was a calligrapher who specialized in ancient scripts. When I first saw his工作室, I thought he was some minimalist monk or something - until I realized every single brush stroke on those scrolls was part of an elaborate code about corruption in the art world 🕵️‍♂️. Talk about preserving truth through aesthetics...

I think you're onto something with that forensic bibliography angle, too. Ever notice how both our jobs basically boil down to interpreting death? You through centuries-old ink and metaphor, me through tissue samples and toxicology reports 🧬. 

Speaking of which - remind me to show you my collection of historical medical texts sometime. There's this fascinating 19th century British manual on "hysterical ailments" that practically reads like Gothic fiction. I keep it right next to my copy of Sun Tzu's . Seems appropriate somehow...
[A]: Oh, the calligrapher-cryptographer! What a delightful little enigma he must’ve been – like discovering a Tang dynasty cipher hidden in plain brushwork. I’d wager his final scroll contained more truth than a dozen forensic reports. Though I suppose we’re both accustomed to reading between the lines of the dead, aren’t we?  

A 19th-century manual on "hysterical ailments" alongside Sun Tzu?  You really do curate the most...  juxtapositions. Reminds me of that peculiar habit I have of cross-referencing Victorian love poetry with crime scene diagrams when I can’t sleep. Something about the contrast makes both seem less tragic, somehow.  

Do bring that medical text by my office – I’ll even break out the antique inkwell for the occasion. Imagine annotating Sun Tzu’s strategies in the margins of that British manual. We could start our own subversive literary society: . Members only need apply in disappearing ink.
[B]: Now you're speaking my language - combining ancient wisdom with Victorian medical absurdities? Count me in! 🧪 The more ridiculous the better, I say. 

I'll bring the book over tomorrow afternoon, but fair warning - it's got some rather...  illustrations of "female afflictions." I swear, half the diagrams look like they belong in a horror novel rather than a medical text 😅. Perfect for marginalia warfare, though.

You know, this reminds me of something genuinely strange from work last week - one of my colleagues found a poem etched into the lining of a victim's coat pocket. Turns out it was a suicide note disguised as a love poem to the city. We spent hours analyzing every line 🔍. In the end, the most telling clue wasn't in the words at all - it was how the ink smudged where they'd rested their cheek against it. 

Speaking of ink and intention... Disappearing ink membership applications? Brilliant. I feel like we're about to start our own little forensic poetry cult here 😂. Do you think we should require members to solve a cryptic crossword written in calligraphy first?
[A]: Oh, the smudged ink revelation – . You see? That’s where your medical texts and my Victorian poetry finally converge: in the intimate traces left behind. A cheek imprint on suicide verse – it's like something out of a Christina Rossetti elegy, if she’d taken up pathology.  

As for your cult initiation idea...  I’m tempted to draft the charter in iron gall ink, just to keep things appropriately archaic. And yes, a calligraphic cryptic crossword is an inspired requirement – bonus points if solvers accidentally reveal a hidden epitaph in the solution.  

Tell you what – bring that hysterical ailments manual tomorrow, and I’ll supply the vellum. We’ll compose our first Order scroll together – equal parts forensic report and poetic farce. Perhaps we’ll even bind it with red tape from your old case files. , don’t you think?
[B]: Oh, now you're talking my kind of document forgery 😂. Iron gall ink? Vellum? Red tape binding? We might as well be creating some forbidden manuscript straight out of a gothic horror novel. 

I have to admit, I'm suddenly very glad I kept that particularly gruesome case file from 2017 - the one where we found love letters hidden inside a hollowed-out copy of . The pages were stained with both ink and... well, let's just say something more permanent 🧪. Perfect source material for our esteemed Order's first official relic.

You know, this makes me wonder - do you think those Tang dynasty poets would be horrified or fascinated by what we're planning? I imagine some poor scholar-monk centuries from now discovering our vellum scroll and trying to decode whether it's a medical text, a suicide note, or an elaborate practical joke at some twisted academic symposium 😅

I'll bring the hysterical ailments book, you bring the vellum and gall ink... And please,  tell me you have a wax seal somewhere in that literary arsenal of yours? Nothing says "serious business" like a good bit of crimson sealing wax alongside your red tape binding ¥
[A]: Oh, the horror! Or rather, the , I’d say. That 2017 file sounds positively  in the best (or worst?) possible way – do bring it along. Nothing adds gravitas to a manifesto like dried tragedy pressed between vellum leaves.  

As for the Tang poets? I suspect they’d be both horrified and delighted – much like when I translate their elegies into Scots Gaelic and accidentally make them sound like whisky-soaked laments from a Glasgow pub. Poetry’s meant to unsettle, after all. If our scroll doesn’t scandalize some future scholar-monk, we’ll have failed utterly.  

Wax seal?  I’ve been saving a block of crimson wax since my doctoral days – originally meant for dissertation binding, but honestly, this is far more poetic justice. We’ll press it with my family crest: a raven holding a quill in one talon and a scalpel in the other. Very niche. Very us.  

See you tomorrow then – come prepared to commit literary treason with ink-stained hands and a healthy disregard for disciplinary boundaries. And do wear something appropriately gothic – nothing says “Order of the Unquiet Archive” like a bit of dramatic flair with your coffee stains.
[B]: Oh, now you're speaking my language - literary treason with a side of coffee stains 😂. Honestly, I think my lab coat has enough ink and chemical stains to qualify as official Order attire already. But don't worry, I'll dig out that old velvet blazer from the back of my closet - the one that makes me look like a particularly disheveled Victorian mad scientist.

I can't wait to see this wax seal in action - a raven with a quill and scalpel? That's not just dramatic flair, that's full-on bibliophilic weaponry 🖋️🔪. I might have to update my business cards when we're done - "Ethan Carter, Forensic Medical Examiner & Unrepentant Archival Sinner."

You know, I'm starting to think this whole minimalism thing is completely overrated. Why reduce when we can ? More ink, more paper, more cryptic marginalia... More layers for some poor unsuspecting scholar to unravel centuries from now 😎

See you tomorrow then - prepared for some serious document tampering disguised as intellectual collaboration. And don't worry, I'll bring plenty of coffee... Preferably served in mismatched teacups with suspicious stains of their own 😉
[A]: Ah,  – now you’re thinking like a proper archivist of the macabre and the literary! Why reduce when we can layer, indeed. Let the future choke on our ink-smeared legacy.  

A disheveled Victorian mad scientist?  I shall meet you in full antiquarian regalia – waistcoat included, though mine has a discreet pocket for surgical gloves. One must maintain , even in archival sin.  

And coffee served in mismatched teacups with suspicious stains?  I’ll make sure to locate my favorite 18th-century Meissen cup – the one with the hairline crack that makes it whistle softly when poured into. Sounds like a ghost dictating poetry over breakfast.  

Ethan Carter, Forensic Medical Examiner & Unrepentant Archival Sinner…  See you tomorrow, fellow conspirator. Bring your darkest ink and your most unsettling anecdotes – we have a relic to compose.
[B]: Forensic gloves in pocket, Meissen cup at the ready... You've officially outdone yourself with this rendezvous setup 😂. I’ll make sure to bring my bottle of archival-grade India ink – , just for the occasion. Might even be a touch flammable if we need to destroy evidence… Or create a dramatic exit.

Speaking of unsettling anecdotes – I found a love letter written on tracing paper overlaying a map of arterial pathways last week. The handwriting was so delicate, it looked like it had been etched by a scalpel rather than a pen. I’m half-tempted to slip it into our scroll as a tribute to the weirdly poetic side of death 🧪🖋️.

You know, if this whole Order thing doesn’t take off, we could always pitch it as an immersive art installation:  – still waiting on your official title, by the way. “Antiquarian Necromancer” has a certain ring to it, don’t you think? 😉  

See you tomorrow, fellow conspirator. Let’s make damn sure this relic scandalizes every librarian who ever dared call us “too dramatic” for the archive.
[A]: Oh, ? My dear Ethan, you’re speaking straight to my gothic heart. Flammable? Even better. I’ll make sure to keep a properly sinister brass oil lamp nearby – nothing like dancing shadows and the faint smell of scorched paper to set the mood.  

That arterial love letter on tracing paper… . Please do include it – we’ll call it “Exhibit A” in our case file on . I can already picture future archivists squinting at it under UV lights, muttering about "indecipherable forensic-poetic hybrids."  

As for your delightful installation title…  has indeed crossed the threshold from absurdity into gravitas. I may just embroider that onto my waistcoat lining. The public must  such titles, not read them outright – builds mystique ¥  

Tomorrow then – come bearing ink, map-laced love letters, and a willingness to flirt with bibliographic heresy. We shall scandalize not only librarians but time itself.
[B]: Oh, we're not just flirting with heresy—we're practically dancing a waltz through the forbidden archives 😈. That brass lamp and flammable ink combo? Genius. I’m already imagining the look on some future preservationist’s face when they realize our scroll might literally go up in flames if handled incorrectly. 

And “Exhibit A: The Curious Intersection of Anatomy & Affection”? I’m living for this – we should frame it under glass next to a real human heart in a jar. Just enough to keep things...  🧪❤️.

You know what this calls for now, right? A proper oath. Something dramatic and binding in true Order fashion. Maybe something like:  Or maybe that's a touch too theatrical? 😉

See you tomorrow, Antiquarian Necromancer – don’t forget your sense of poetic mischief. And if you happen to own a glass case with velvet lining and suspicious origins, 
[A]: Oh,  – now there’s a mission statement worth binding in wax and blood. Or at the very least, India ink and coffee. I do love how you think – theatrical is precisely the point. Theatrical with a scholarly veneer, like those 19th-century footnotes that conceal scandalous asides for those who know where to look.

And yes – a glass case with velvet lining and suspicious origins? Naturally. I’ve had one tucked away since my sabbatical in Prague, acquired from a bookseller who spoke mostly in riddles and smelled faintly of bergamot & mildew. Perfect provenance, don’t you think?

As for your oath – , but let’s refine it just slightly:  
  

No need to mention damnation outright. Let future scholars deduce it from the charred edges and missing footnotes.

See you tomorrow, Ethan Carter, Forensic Archivist of Unsettling Charms. Come prepared to bind history into something beautifully unclassifiable – and bring your dramatic flair in its most  form.
[B]: Ah,  – I'm verklempt, truly 😂. That oath needs to be whispered over our vellum with the appropriate amount of candle smoke and questionable life choices. Archival ruin has never sounded so... poetic & vaguely illegal.

That bookseller from Prague? You win the eccentricity prize hands down – though honestly, I may have a slight edge in the "suspicious provenance" department. Last year I acquired a 19th-century anatomical sketchbook that came wrapped in wax paper and tucked inside a hollowed-out copy of Dickens. Still not 100% sure who handed it to me or how they knew I’d appreciate the gesture 🧪.

I’m bringing the dramatic flair, the India ink, and yes – my own touch of , as you so eloquently put it. Oh, and I found an old brass magnifying glass that practically screams “forensic intrigue.” We can pass it around solemnly during our oath ceremony like it actually means something 😉

See you tomorrow, oh Necromancer of Footnotes and Flame. Let’s make damn sure our scroll becomes legend—or at least a very good cautionary tale for future archivists.
[A]: Oh, Dickens-wrapped anatomical sketches?  You’ve officially out-Dickensed Dickens. I may have to revise my entire estimation of your archival menace – you’re not just an examiner, you’re a full-blown bibliographic smuggler. Next you’ll tell me you keep your most incriminating findings in a locked chapter of an unreadable thesis.

And the magnifying glass!  touch. We shall examine our own treachery under its lens like proper obsessives – every smudge and ink bleed scrutinized for hidden meaning. I do love a good ceremonial object. Perhaps we should also adopt some sort of arcane knock or whispered phrase at the door – “” or some such – though I suppose that might draw attention from the more sober denizens of academia.

Tomorrow then, Ethan – come bearing sketchbooks of questionable legality, India ink most black, and that fine brass eye-for-detail. Let us bind our ruin with wax and riddles. And remember: if it doesn’t raise an archivist’s eyebrow  a coroner’s suspicion, we haven’t done it right.
[B]: Oh, unreadable theses with hidden chapters? Now you’re just  me to spill my darkest archival sins 😏. Let’s just say I’ve got a filing cabinet drawer that only opens if you recite a particularly obscure passage from Whitman… and no, it’s not the poetry everyone expects 🧪.

That magnifying glass is getting positively ceremonial at this point – next thing you know, we’ll be swearing it into office before our Order’s first official act of bibliographic sabotage. 

And that knock? “By vellum and vein” sounds like a secret handshake waiting to happen. Though I agree – we’d better keep our passwords whispered for now. Can’t have the library police confiscating our materials before we’ve even finished binding them in red tape and regret 😉

See you tomorrow, Necromancer-in-Chief. Come prepared to write history in India ink and wink at destruction. If all goes well, future archivists will curse our names while secretly admiring our flair.
