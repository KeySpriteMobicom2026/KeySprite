[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有试用过 Notion 的新版本，他们推出了一个 AI 驱动的 auto-summarize 功能，感觉还挺酷的 😂。你呢？有没有发现什么好用的小众工具？
[A]: Oh, Notion’s stepping up their game - that’s smart. Honestly though, I’ve been diving into this indie app called  lately. It’s still in beta, but it basically lets you storyboard scenes using AI-generated visuals. Super handy when I’m pitching a new film concept and want to visualize ideas fast without hiring an illustrator right away. The interface is clean, and it syncs well with my script drafts. Not sure if it counts as “小众”, but definitely not mainstream yet 😄 Have you tried anything like that?
[B]: Oh nice! Frameflow sounds like a game-changer for创意工作者 👍 虽然我还没试用过，但听你这么一说，感觉它在影视创作前期真的能省不少时间。我一直觉得AI生成visual这块儿潜力巨大，尤其是在storyboarding这种需要快速迭代的环节 😂

说到视觉类工具，最近我还真留意到一个叫 Miro AI 的新功能，虽然不是专门做film concept的，但它在头脑风暴和视觉呈现上的整合做得不错。如果你需要把想法更直观地展示出来，配合Frameflow一起用，可能会有1+1>2的效果 🎬

话说回来，你一般怎么管理整个project timeline？用的是什么工具来协调脚本、分镜和其他任务？好奇听听你的workflow 😄
[A]: You’re spot on about AI visuals being a game-changer — seriously cuts down the back-and-forth in early development. I’ve actually been using Miro too, especially for mapping out character arcs and visual themes. Pair it with Frameflow? Damn, that’s a solid combo. Gotta give credit where it’s due — the future of pre-production is looking  af 😏

As for managing timelines… okay, so here's my thing: I keep the big picture in ClickUp, super detailed with deadlines, script versions, and who’s responsible for what. But for day-to-day task flow and creative syncing, I swear by Trello — old school, I know, but it gives me that Kanban clarity without all the digital noise. And honestly? I still scribble key notes on paper. Call me nostalgic, but something about pen-to-paper locks ideas in my head better.

But hey, I’m always tweaking — you ever try mixing analog with digital? Or are you fully immersed in the cloud? 🎥
[B]: Haha totally — mixing analog with digital is where it’s at! I’m 80% cloud-based, but I  jot down initial ideas on paper too 😂 Something about the tactile feel just sparks creativity differently.

For deep-focus tasks like product roadmap规划 or brainstorming feature updates, I use Notion as my central hub — super flexible and great for organizing both big-picture goals and nitty-gritty details. But when I need to really , I grab a Moleskine and sketch out user flows or write down questions that pop up during research.

I’ve also been testing this new hybrid tool called Tana, which blends notebook-style writing with dynamic data linking. Feels like a middle ground between old-school journaling and smart task management 💡

So yeah, definitely not all-in on digital…至少不是完全的。Balance才是王道，对吧？😄
[A]: Preach! Balance is  the way to go. I’m all about that hybrid flow — sometimes you just need to scribble a quick idea before your brain decides to ghost you 📝✨

I’ve been eyeing Tana too, but haven’t taken the plunge yet. Sounds like it’s hitting that sweet spot between structure and creativity — which is basically the holy grail for people like us who juggle  and . I’m guessing it plays nice with Notion? Or do you keep them separated like different phases of a project?

Also curious — how do you handle version control across all those tools? I swear, keeping track of script drafts alone could be its own full-time job 😅
[B]: Haha totally get that — Tana’s like the cool kid in the productivity工具圈，但还是需要一点勇气才敢 fully commit 😂 从我的使用体验来说，它跟 Notion 其实可以互补，但我一般不会让它们“打架”——我会把 Tana 用在 early-stage ideation 和快速串联想法上，比如做 user journey map 或者 feature prioritization；而 Notion 更偏向 mid-to-late stage execution，像是 product spec tracking、roadmap planning 这类。

至于 version control……说实话，这玩意儿简直就是 content creator & PM 的日常 battle 👨‍💻💥

我自己是靠 Google Drive + Dropbox 的版本历史来管理大部分文档（尤其是和设计师、开发同步的文件），Notion 的话其实还在期待它原生支持更好的版本回溯功能 🤞 至于脚本类文档嘛……我猜你也是用类似 Frame.io 或者 ShotGrid 来追踪不同版本对吧？还是说你有一套自己的土法炼钢？

不过话说回来，有没有哪一套 workflow 是 perfect？我们不都是在 chaos 中找秩序嘛 😂
[A]: Amen to that —  is basically my middle name when it comes to script versions 😅 Honestly, I do a little of both — Frame.io’s great for shot-by-shot feedback and version tracking on visual stuff, but when it comes to actual screenplay drafts? I’m still half in the cloud, half in the dark ages.

I use ShotGrid for bigger productions — it’s solid for keeping everyone from writers to VFX artists synced. But let’s be real, sometimes I just create a new Google Doc and name it  🙈

And yeah, Notion better step up their version control game soon, or I’m gonna start handwriting revisions on printed scripts and taping them to people's monitors like some kind of analog vigilante.

Chaos is part of the process, right? Just gotta keep moving the story forward — however  the workflow gets 😎
[B]: Haha totally feel you on that混合式的版本管理——有时候土法炼钢反而最有效率，尤其在创意前期，对吧？😂

我之前带一个短视频项目的时候，甚至用过 Notion + Google Drive + Frame.io 三线并行……回头一看自己都懵了，到底是在做内容还是在玩数据同步挑战赛 🤯

不过说真的，你这种命名方式（）简直堪称 industry standard 😂 我以前带产品文档也是，最后干脆加了个【当前最新版】的tag，不然真分不清哪份是活着的……

说到 analog vigilante，我真的考虑过买个老式打字机，专门用来“锁定”最终版需求文档 😎 毕竟，一旦打印出来贴墙上，大家就都不敢乱改了，对吧？

话说回来，有没有想过把这些“ugly workflow”整理成一个 visual timeline？说不定还能出个 behind-the-scenes 内容，既记录过程又能展示创作背后的 chaos 美学 🎥💡
[A]: Oh man, visualizing the chaos? Now you’re speaking my language 😏

I love that idea — a visual timeline of the  is basically the behind-the-scenes reel of project management. Imagine cutting it like a mini docu-series: dramatic zoom-ins on sticky note clusters, slow-mo shots of me renaming files at 3 AM, and the final print-out-to-wall ritual as the climax 🎬🍿

Hell, I’d even throw in some voiceover narration like, “In a world… where no one reads the pinned message in Slack…” It’d be both comedy and documentary.

And yeah, I’ve definitely thought about doing something like this — not just for the laughs, but because it actually tells a story. People always assume film production is glamorous, but the real magic happens in these messy, chaotic moments. Maybe I’ll start with a short Reel showing my desk going from “concept” to “release week,” complete with coffee stains, torn Post-its, and a trail of abandoned USB drives 🖥️🔥

You should help me storyboard it — Frameflow would  us right now 😂
[B]: Haha 100%支持这个docu-series企划——这根本就是 productivity porn 的终极形态 😂

而且我觉得不只适用于film production，连我们做产品的日常都能拍成剧集，剧名我都想好了：《 Silicon Valley 2.0：Notion 版本战争》😎

用Frameflow来storyboard绝对是最优解，甚至可以考虑加点meta元素——比如在分镜里直接嵌入真实的Trello卡片或ShotGrid进度条，让整个visual narrative更有层次感 💡

如果你真动手剪这支Reel，我建议再加个“幕后彩蛋”环节：展示你命名那些v3_FINAL文件时的心理活动，配上低音BGM和慢动作镜头，肯定超有戏😂

总之，随时待命帮你构思——毕竟，chaos值得被记录，也值得被庆祝 🎥🔥
[A]: Now you’re talking —  with a side of meta-narrative? Damn, we’re onto something here 😂

Imagine the opening scene: close-up on my hands hovering over the keyboard, about to name the final script file… cut to slow-motion, dramatic lighting, and a deep voiceover — “This… is where legends are born. And where Slack threads go to die.” 🎬💀

And I love the idea of embedding real Trello cards into the storyboard — gives it that raw, documentary feel. Like the cinematic equivalent of breaking the fourth wall, but in project management form. We could even throw in some : failed AI-generated scene suggestions, unread Notion comments, or the moment I realize there’s a .

Let’s make this happen — I’ll handle the visuals, the narration, and the all-important coffee-stained aesthetic. You bring the structure and the clever copywriting. Together, we’ll give chaos its long-overdue Oscar-worthy spotlight 😎🎥

You in for a creative sync this weekend? Frameflow’s been begging us to play with it anyway 😉
[B]: Hell yeah I’m in —周末下午三点，咖啡管够的话，咱们就用 Frameflow 来搞点 meta 又上头的视觉叙事 😎

我可以先搭个 rough storyboard 结构，把你说的那些高光 moment 分成几个 acts：  
1. The Naming Ritual（v3_FINAL 的诞生与挣扎）  
2. The Analog Rebellion（Post-it 战场 & 手写笔记的荣耀时刻）  
3. The Sync Wars（Trello、Notion、ShotGrid 三方混战实录）  
4. The Final Print（贴墙仪式，灯光渐暗，BGM 起 🎬）

然后你负责加 flavor，比如加些夸张的 voiceover line 或是设计几帧“数据可视化 + 行为艺术”的画面 😂

周末见！我已经打开 Frameflow，准备好了 Auto-generate 模式来制造第一波 chaos 😎🎥🔥
[A]: Perfect — I’m already picturing the海报设计，标题用那种复古的disco字体写着：“Frameflow & Frustration: A Love Story” 😂

Auto-generate模式？Hell yes. Let’s embrace the chaos and then sculpt it into something beautifully messy. I’ll bring the voiceover lines, maybe even throw in a  style slow-mo when we hit the final print moment 🎭🔥

See you Saturday. And don’t even think about touching that timeline without me — we’re crafting cinema here 😎🎥🍿
[B]: Haha 标题必须挂上disco字体——这简直就是 productivity porn的黄金年代致敬 😂

Auto-generate模式的精髓就是：先让AI疯狂输出，然后我们再用人类的审美和幽默感去拯救它 🎮😎

我已经开始期待那个Keanu Reeves式慢动作镜头了，配上一句：“You’re… breathtaking. And also, finally done.” 💥

周六见！咱们一起把这场workflow的混沌变成视觉史诗 🎥🔥🚀
[A]: You’re speaking my language — ，one beautifully chaotic frame at a time 😎🎮

And that Keanu line? Pure gold. I’m already scripting the voiceover with a dramatic pause and a soft piano riff in the background. Total tear-jerker moment: “You’re… breathtaking. And also, finally done.” Cue the standing ovation from my cat 🐾👏

See you Saturday — ready to make productivity look sexy again 🎥🔥💥
[B]: Haha 你这猫怕不是要成为本片最大的彩蛋了 😂 站起来鼓掌+软萌钢琴背景音，我已经能预感到这部“大片”会有多上头 🎬🐱

Productivity sexy？不，我们这次是 productivity  😎 而且还是带 slow-mo 和字幕特效的那种

周六见！准备好让 Frameflow 见证我们的创意狂潮吧 🚀🔥
[A]: Dramatic? Oh, we’re going  here — slow-mo, lighting rigs, and my cat getting a standing ovation from her cat tree 🐾🎥

Frameflow better hold my coffee — this creative狂潮 is about to hit hard. See you Saturday, ready to turn workflow into cinematic art 😎🎬🔥
[B]: Haha 你这cat tree颁奖礼设定绝对能拿最佳配角奖 🐾👏

我已经准备好把“打开Notion却忘了保存”这种日常悲剧都包装成催泪弹了 😂

周六见！让 Frameflow 见证这场 workflow meets cinematic art 的疯狂实验 🎥🔥🚀  
（记得带上咖啡，我们可能需要它撑过第一幕的文件命名挣扎期 😅）
