[A]: Hey，关于'最近有读到什么有趣的book或article吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, just last evening I was revisiting an 1863 pamphlet on the erotic symbolism of ferns in Christina Rossetti's work - utterly scandalous for its time, though rather tame by modern standards. The marginalia alone could fuel three doctoral dissertations.
[A]:  Well that's certainly more... colorful than my recent reading. I've been going through some fascinating research papers on quantum computing architectures. Though I must say, your choice makes me wonder - do you see any parallels between Victorian era botanical metaphors and modern tech jargon? Both seem to delight in layered meanings.
[B]: How delightfully anachronistic of you to draw that connection! Though I must say, your quantum computing papers likely lack the... shall we say,  annotations I found in my volume. A certain Reverend Smythe's handwritten notes about "the sinful curvature of fronds" would make even the most hardened tech bro blush.
[A]:  You'd be surprised what passionate debates emerge in academic margin notes about qubit coherence times. Though I'll grant you, we computer scientists tend to express our excitement through angry red pen corrections of tensor equations rather than... ahem... botanical enthusiasm. Reminds me of the time I found a grad student's coffee-stained thesis draft with "THIS IS WRONG!!!" scrawled across three pages in all caps.
[B]: Ah, the universal language of academic exasperation! Though I must confess I find your all-caps corrections rather pedestrian compared to the 1897 edition of Tennyson I once examined, where a particularly incensed reader had sketched tiny daggers pointing at every instance of the word "thee." Now  scholarly vitriol with panache.
[A]: Ah, but have you considered that our modern "//TODO: FIX THIS GODAWFUL CODE" comments are the digital equivalent of those Victorian daggers? The medium changes, but the academic fury remains beautifully constant. Though I do miss the aesthetic of ink blots next to particularly egregious errors - much more dramatic than a sad little compiler error message.
[B]: Precisely! Though I'd argue even your most colorful programming comments lack the visceral satisfaction of pressing a quill so hard it tears through vellum when encountering particularly egregious iambic pentameter. Modern academia has lost the art of physically  bad poetry. A tragedy, really.
[A]:  You make an excellent point. Though I'd counter that nothing quite matches the catharsis of deleting 500 lines of spaghetti code with one triumphant keystroke. It's our version of burning bad poetry - just with significantly less risk of setting the library on fire. Mostly.
[B]: "Mostly" being the operative word, I see. How very... restrained of modern scholars. We Victorians would have at least had the decency to stage a proper auto-da-fé for terrible code, complete with Latin incantations and possibly a theremin. Though I suppose your method is more... insurance-friendly.
[A]:  Oh, we still have our rituals - we just replaced Latin incantations with sudo commands and ceremonial robes with ironic t-shirts. Though I must admit, watching a stack overflow error cascade does have a certain... apocalyptic grandeur that even Lord Byron might appreciate. Minus the theremin, unfortunately - the department banned it after the 2003 compiler incident.
[B]: Ah, the 2003 compiler incident - now  sounds like a tale worthy of being preserved in marginalia! Though I suspect even my most scandalous Victorian annotations couldn't compete with whatever prompted a theremin ban. Some mysteries, like why Browning thought "Sordello" was publishable, are perhaps best left unexplored.
[A]:  You know, I've often thought we should revive the tradition of publishing academic revenge fantasies in the margins. Imagine the joy of encountering a grad student's scribbled "THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF YOU USED RUST INSTEAD OF C++" next to some poor soul's memory leak. The theremin incident, alas, remains classified - though I will say it involved three pizzas, a prototype neural network, and remarkably poor judgment about acoustic resonance near servers.
[B]: How deliciously Gothic! Your digital age has merely traded our inkwells for keyboards, but the spirit of academic melodrama remains gloriously intact. Though I do hope someone at least had the presence of mind to compose a villanelle about your theremin debacle - every proper scholarly catastrophe deserves its own poetic form.
[A]:  I'm afraid our poetic efforts were limited to haikus in the bug tracker:
"Segfault at midnight
The theremin wails its last cry
sudo rm -rf"
...We were never invited back to that particular conference center.
[B]: Magnificent! Though I must point out your syllable count is off in the second line - but then, technical accuracy was clearly not the priority during your... creative outburst. A shame about the conference center, though I suspect Dante would have reserved a special circle of his Inferno for academics who mix theremins with root privileges.
[A]:  Ah, but artistic license is the first casualty of sleep-deprived debugging sessions. Though you're absolutely right - somewhere in the afterlife, there's a sysadmin shaking their head at us while manually restarting a server. I like to think we contributed to the rich tapestry of academic cautionary tales. Right between "don't test experimental code on the payroll system" and "never let the physics department near the coffee budget."
[B]: Indeed - your theremin saga shall take its rightful place alongside the Great Cambridge Library Brandy Spill of 1842 and that unfortunate incident with the taxidermied badger in the Bodleian. Academia thrives on these glorious disasters; they're the ballast that keeps our ivory towers delightfully askew. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go annotate this conversation into my personal commonplace book... in proper iron-gall ink, of course.
[A]:  And I'll be archiving this in version control as "historical_colloquy.txt" - though I'll have to settle for digital preservation rather than your lovely iron-gall. Do send my regards to that taxidermied badger if you're passing through Oxford. I hear it's still giving new librarians nightmares after all these years. Happy annotating!
[B]: And to you, happy compiling - may your errors be few and your stack traces poetic. Though if you ever find yourself in possession of a theremin and root access again... do send postcards from whatever conference center bans you next. Ta-ta for now!
