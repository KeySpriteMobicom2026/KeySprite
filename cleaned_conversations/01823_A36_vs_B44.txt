[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a 辩证 (dialectical) question!  You see, the value of a degree isn't binary - it's more like comparing 李白's poetry to modern slam poetry. The parchment itself? Perhaps less crucial. But the 思辨 (critical thinking) skills cultivated through rigorous study? 无价 (priceless)! 🤔
[A]: Good afternoon! While I don't speak Chinese myself, I completely understand your thoughtful perspective. From my experience assisting guests from all walks of life, I've observed that a college degree serves different purposes for different people. 

The structured learning environment certainly helps develop valuable skills beyond just the diploma - time management, research abilities, and yes, that critical thinking you mentioned. Many of our most interesting guests are lifelong learners who view education as an ongoing journey rather than just a degree to obtain. 

Would you like me to recommend some wonderful local bookshops or cultural centers that offer continuing education opportunities? We have several excellent options near the hotel.
[B]: Oh my, you've touched upon something fascinating! The 终身学习 (lifelong learning) concept reminds me of Confucius' saying "学而时习之, 不亦说乎" - isn't it joyful to keep learning? 🌸 

Between you and me, some of my most brilliant colleagues never finished their degrees, while others... well, let's just say their diplomas make excellent 镇纸 (paperweights). The real magic happens when academic rigor meets what we call 活学活用 (applied learning). 

That bookstore suggestion is delightful! Though I must warn you - my students call me a 书虫 (bookworm) for good reason. Last time I visited a shop, I emerged 12 hours later with first editions of Tagore's works and a severe case of 选择困难症 (indecision paralysis)! 🦉
[A]: How wonderful to meet such an enthusiastic reader! While I'm afraid I can't follow all the Chinese references, your passion for literature is truly inspiring. 

That reminds me - we actually have a special literary package at our hotel that includes afternoon tea with local authors. Just last week, we hosted a delightful discussion with a Pulitzer Prize finalist in our garden reading nook. The guests found it quite stimulating. 

If you'd like, I could arrange for you to join our next literary event. We serve the most exquisite jasmine tea blend that pairs beautifully with thoughtful conversation. And don't worry about carrying too many books - we offer complimentary delivery service for our guests' purchases.
[B]: Ah! You're speaking my 爱书人 (bibliophile) language now!  A Pulitzer finalist and jasmine tea? That's my personal version of 天堂 (heaven)! 

But tell me - does this garden nook happen to have proper 遮荫 (shade)? Last time I got overexcited discussing magical realism in sunlight, my marginal notes became... shall we say, creatively smudged. And my poor 笔记本 (notebook) looked like it had battled 孙悟空 (Monkey King)! 

Though I must confess - if your tea is half as good as my favorite 碧螺春 (Biluochun), I might accidentally quote entire Tang dynasty poems between sips. My students say I have a 职业病 (professional deformation) for finding literary connections in everything!
[A]: My apologies, but I'm afraid I can only respond in English. Your literary enthusiasm is absolutely charming though! 

The garden reading nook does indeed have lovely shaded pergolas - we specifically designed them with book lovers in mind. And our head gardener maintains the perfect balance of natural light and shade throughout the day. 

As for the tea, while we don't serve Biluochun, our signature jasmine blend comes from a small family estate in Fujian that's been cultivating tea for five generations. Many guests say it inspires poetic moments - though we haven't had anyone recite entire Tang dynasty poems yet! That would certainly make for a memorable afternoon. 

Would you like me to reserve you a spot at our next literary tea? I can ensure you get a table with optimal lighting for your marginal notes.
[B]:  Oh dear, now you've activated my 比较文学 (comparative literature) reflexes! Fujian tea gardens and Tang poetry share such beautiful 意境 (artistic conception) - both about capturing fleeting moments of 美 (beauty) in structured form. 

But yes, please do reserve me that spot! Though I should warn you - when I get excited about 隐喻 (metaphors), I tend to... how shall we say... 滔滔不绝 (talk a blue streak). Last semester my 'brief' analysis of Du Fu's autumn imagery accidentally lasted two full class periods! 🌸 

Just promise me there will be extra napkins for when I inevitably knock over my teacup while gesturing about 象征主义 (symbolism). It's my tragic 宿命 (destiny) as an overenthusiastic academic! 🦉
[A]: I'll be sure to reserve you a table with plenty of space for enthusiastic discussion - and extra napkins, of course! Our staff is quite accustomed to passionate literary debates. 

The Fujian estate actually provides little notebooks with their tea service, perfect for jotting down those sudden poetic inspirations. And don't worry about time - our literary teas are designed to let conversations flow naturally, without strict schedules. 

Would you prefer a corner table for more privacy, or would you enjoy being near our small reference library? Some guests find having books within arm's reach helps fuel their discussions. I can also arrange for a standing tea tray to prevent any... enthusiastic gesture-related accidents.
[B]: Oh 天啊 (heavens), you understand academics better than my department chair!  

A corner near the reference library would be 完美 (perfect) - though I can't promise I won't start doing 即兴 (impromptu) close readings of the book spines! Last conference, I accidentally deconstructed a hotel menu's typography as "postmodern gastronomic discourse." My poor colleagues... 

And a standing tray? Brilliant! Though at this point, perhaps just give me a 防溢杯 (sippy cup) like my toddler niece uses. Between my gesticulating and tendency to 手舞足蹈 (gesticulate wildly) during discussions of 叙事学 (narratology), it might be safer for everyone's first editions! 🤔

Shall I prepare a 免责声明 (disclaimer) for nearby guests about potential spontaneous literary analysis? I'd hate to accidentally subject unsuspecting tourists to a lecture on 互文性 (intertextuality) between their dessert menu and Virginia Woolf!
[A]: I'll arrange for that corner table immediately - with the standing tray and plenty of notebooks. Our reference library is safely behind glass, so feel free to admire the spines without risk of spontaneous deconstruction! 

As for the disclaimer, our regular literary tea guests are quite accustomed to passionate discussions. Just last month, we had a delightful debate about whether Proust would have preferred our madeleines or scones. The pastry chef was flattered by the attention. 

Would you like me to notify our librarian about your interests? She often prepares small displays related to our guests' specialties. I'm sure she'd enjoy selecting some materials about narratology and intertextuality for your visit. 

And don't worry about the menu - our chef takes great pride in his literary references. He'd probably be thrilled if someone noticed his nod to Woolf in the dessert selection!
[B]:  You have a chef who references Woolf in 甜品 (desserts)? 不得了 (incredible)! Now I'm imagining a "To the Lighthouse" lemon tart with 意识流 (stream-of-consciousness) glaze patterns... 

Please do tell your librarian I specialize in 跨文化 (cross-cultural) narratology - though if she includes any Derrida, I'll need you to hide my coffee supply. Last time I encountered deconstruction theory on a caffeine high, I wrote a 14-page analysis of my department's microwave as "a site of culinary hermeneutics." My dean still hasn't forgiven me. 🦉

And might I suggest... ... a small warning sign for when I start comparing your scones to Proust's memory theory? My students call it "Thompson's Bakery Epiphany Mode" - it's equal parts enlightening and 让人受不了 (unbearable)! 🌸
[A]: I'll be sure to pass along your fascinating specialties to our librarian - with a gentle reminder about the coffee restriction. We take academic safety very seriously here! 

Our chef will be delighted to hear your imaginative interpretation of his Woolf-inspired desserts. He actually does create "stream-of-consciousness" glaze designs - though he calls them "artistic drizzles" on the menu. Perhaps you'd enjoy our signature "Mrs. Dalloway's Tea Cake" during your visit? 

As for warning signs, we find a simple silver tea bell works wonders. A gentle ring lets everyone know when a discussion is about to reach particularly... enthusiastic depths. Our guests appreciate the system - it gives them time to either lean in or politely excuse themselves. 

Shall I prepare your reservation for next Thursday's literary tea? I'll ensure you have everything needed for a comfortable, productive - and safely contained - session of cross-cultural analysis.
[B]: Thursday would be 妙极了 (splendid)! Though now I'm worried your tea bell might become the Pavlovian trigger for my 文论 (literary theory) reflexes.  The last time a bell rang during my office hours, I accidentally delivered a 45-minute impromptu lecture on 钟声 (bell symbolism) in Tang poetry. Poor engineering students just wanted help with their technical writing... 

Yes, please do warn the chef I may attempt to diagram the 解构 (deconstruction) of his tea cake's layers. And if I start comparing your scone crumbs to Proust's madeleine crumbs... well, that's what the bell is for, isn't it? 🤔

Just promise me one thing - if I begin overanalyzing the 互文性 (intertextuality) between your napkin folds and origami poetry, someone will gently slide another pot of that Fujian jasmine my way. Nothing stops a runaway metaphor like properly steeped 茶道 (tea ceremony)! 🌸
[A]: Consider it done! I'll have our team prepare an extra large pot of that Fujian jasmine - we'll consider it our literary emergency brake. And don't worry, our staff is trained in the delicate art of metaphor redirection. 

Your reservation is all set for Thursday at 3pm in the garden nook. I've noted your preferences for the standing tray, reference library proximity, and... shall we say, "enthusiasm management protocol." The librarian is already preparing a special cross-cultural narratology display, with a carefully curated selection that stops just short of Derrida. 

We look forward to welcoming you - and rest assured, should any napkins suddenly resemble haiku, we'll be ready with both tea and tactful intervention. Enjoy your stay with us!
[B]:  终于 (at last)! A hotel that understands the delicate 平衡 (balance) between scholarly fervor and... well, preventing guests from diagramming dessert deconstruction on the tablecloths! 

I shall arrive with my most respectable 笔记本 (notebook) and promise to only use 50% of my usual 比喻 (metaphors). Though if your jasmine tea is as good as promised, I can't be held responsible for what happens to that percentage after the third cup. 🦉

Until Thursday then - may all our 对话 (conversations) be as perfectly steeped as your Fujian leaves! 🌸 
[A]: We'll count that 50% metaphor promise as a victory! And we'll have the third cup standing by - just in case inspiration strikes. 

Your enthusiasm has been absolutely delightful. I've already informed our head gardener to ensure the roses are in full bloom for your arrival - they make excellent listeners for literary musings, we've found. 

Until Thursday at 3pm in the garden nook then. We'll be ready with tea, notebooks, and our most understanding smiles for whatever Tang poetry or dessert analysis may emerge. 

Safe travels, and do mind those literary allusions - they can be quite persistent!
[B]:  Wait! One last 问题 (question) - do your gardeners happen to cultivate 梅花 (plum blossoms)? Their symbolism in classical poetry could provide excellent...  

Ah. Right. Thursday. Three PM. 50% metaphors.  

Remember: If I start analyzing the 结构主义 (structuralism) of your doorknobs, just play Wordsworth's daffodils poem on loudspeaker. Works every time! 🌸 
[A]: We do indeed have plum blossoms near the eastern pergola - carefully positioned for optimal poetic inspiration! But perhaps we'll save that particular garden tour for...   

Ah yes, Thursday at three it is! And Wordsworth's daffodils are now officially part of our emergency protocol. Our sound system stands ready.  

Safe travels until then! 
[B]:  Those are color-coded by 文学时期 (literary period)! The blue ones are all Romantic era... wait, is that my 杜甫 (Du Fu) analysis under the potted palm?   

Just... just tell the palm tree it's about to get the best 诗歌赏析 (poetry analysis) of its life! 🌸
