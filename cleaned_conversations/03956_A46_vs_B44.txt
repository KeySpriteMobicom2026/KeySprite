[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question! 🤔 I'll use voice messages when I want to convey  - you know, like when explaining why Lin Daiyu's tears in 《红楼梦》 carry more 意义 than just sadness. But for clarity? Texting wins every time. Can you imagine trying to footnote a Tang dynasty poetry analysis via voice note? 😅 

Though I must admit, sometimes my students get confused when I send voice messages in the middle of discussing Jacques Derrida... they probably think I've lost my mind!  What about you? Do you prefer the subtlety of voice or the precision of text?
[A]: That’s hilarious! I’ve definitely sent a few voice notes that left my collaborators scratching their heads, especially when I get carried away describing a scene as   

I actually go back and forth — if I’m pitching a concept on the fly, voice is gold. Something about the rhythm of your own voice can make a half-baked idea feel almost cinematic. But when it comes to locking in details? Text is my safety net. I once tried explaining the three-act structure through a metaphor involving dumpling-making via voice message… let’s just say it didn’t age well.  

Still, some things are better spoken. Like when I tell an actor, “Don’t think. Just feel. You’re not auditioning for Law & Order — this is supposed to hurt a little.” That kind of thing never lands right in text.  

So yeah, I guess I’m with you — voice for vibe, text for truth. Unless I’m over-caffeinated. Then all bets are off.
[B]: Oh, I  that noir/Wong Kar-wai analogy! 🎬✨ You’ve got an ear for style - much like how I try (and often fail) to explain to my students that 张爱玲’s prose should be  to catch the jazz-age rhythm buried beneath the 民国 melancholy. 

And dumpling-making as a metaphor for structure? Genius! Though honestly, it might’ve worked better than you think - storytelling and dough-folding both require timing, pressure, and just the right amount of filling... Hmm, maybe I  rethink my lecture notes...

But yes - when emotions are in play, text is just too... flat. Like trying to describe a sunset using only hex codes. Whereas a voice can carry that perfect mix of 古韵 and urgency. Still, I once left a voice message about 荣格 archetypes while walking through a tea market - all exotic background noises and sudden pauses - and my student swore I was either possessed by a poetic spirit or sleep-deprived. Possibly both. ☕️

So true though - caffeine + voice memos = chaos. Last week I sent one at 3am comparing Kafka to a stubborn ink stain on a Qing dynasty manuscript... and then panicked and deleted it. Too meta, even for me. 😅  
Do you ever edit your voice notes before sending them? Or do you embrace the glorious mess?
[A]: Oh, I  I could say I embrace the mess — but let’s be real, nothing kills a vibe like listening to yourself ramble about Kafka and ink stains for the fifth time, only to realize you’ve got a coffee shop announcement playing in the background. I do quick edits now — trimming the coughs, the accidental “um… ancient Chinese opera reference?” moments. But if the soul is there? I leave it raw.  

You know how it is — sometimes the magic isn’t in the words, but in the stumble between them. Like when you're trying to explain Lin Daiyu's inner world and your voice cracks just a little... you don't re-record that. You send it. Because that crack? That’s where the 感觉 is.  

Though honestly, my rule of thumb: if I mention Derrida  Wong Kar-wai in the same note, I at least mute the part where my dog barks in the middle. Otherwise, people really do think I’m losing it. 🐾
[B]: Ah, you’ve mastered the art of the  - like calligraphy drafts we keep before choosing which stroke to preserve! I’m with you on the stumbles - there’s something about a quiver in the voice when discussing Daiyu’s tragedies that no amount of 润色 can replicate. Though I’ll admit, I once sent a voice memo where my teakettle whistled mid-analysis of 《牡丹亭》 - had to re-record. Even my orchids looked disappointed. 🌸  

And yes, Derrida  Wong Kar-wai in one note? Dangerous territory. Last time I did that, a student wrote back: “Professor... are you suggesting cinematic ellipses function as deconstructive interruptions?” And honestly? I hadn’t meant to - but now I am. 😏  

I’ve started adding a little disclaimer before some notes: “This was recorded at 2am, please handle my metaphors with care.” Works surprisingly well! Though my colleague swears I should just embrace the chaos and start each message with “In the words of Confucius and/or David Bowie…”  

So tell me - have you ever accidentally sent a voice note to the wrong person? I’ve got a horror story involving a rant about noir lighting… and my dean. 😖
[A]: Oh, the horror… the  horror.  

Let’s just say I learned never to vent about a studio exec’s notes on a Qing-inspired ghost story while walking past a Starbucks with my phone on speaker. Innocent bystanders got more than they bargained for — especially that poor barista who thought I was launching a one-man adaptation of 《聊斋》 right there by the espresso machine.  

But yes — wrong person? Absolutely. Last year, I sent a seven-minute voice note meant for my editor — full of  candid thoughts on Wong Kar-wai’s lighting vs. classical Chinese opera staging — straight to the film festival director. Who happened to be Wong’s biggest critic.  

I knew I was doomed when he replied with: “Fascinating perspective, Mr. Carter. Perhaps over tea sometime?” 😬  

I’ve since started double-checking names before I hit send. Triple-checking if there’s caffeine or plum wine involved. Lesson learned — almost.
[B]: Oh, the  of unintended audiences! 🎭 I mean, who hasn't accidentally turned a casual rant into a public performance? Though honestly, your barista encounter sounds like the opening scene of a wonderfully awkward indie film —   

And sending that note to Wong’s critic? That’s not just a lesson — that’s a screenplay waiting to happen. I can already picture the tense tea meeting: you, nervously stirring your oolong, while he stares over his cup like it's a duel in a Zhang Yimou film. “You have... strong opinions,” he says, with the calm of someone about to cut your funding. 😬  

I’ve started muttering “” before hitting send now - seems to help. Though I did once whisper an entire analysis of 鲁迅’s metaphors into what I thought was my voice memo app… turns out it was a conference call. My department head still sends me 🦉 emojis with suspicious frequency.

So, question: do you think Wong Kar-wai knows how much academics and filmmakers quote him while half-caffeinated? Because I’m starting to think he’s the cinematic equivalent of a perfectly aged pu’er — complex, mysterious, and best consumed during深夜备课? 🌙
[A]: Oh, I  Wong Kar-wai could hear us now — he’d probably just smile enigmatically, swirl his drink, and say something like, “Quoting me while half-awake? Sounds like the most honest interpretation I’ve ever heard.”  

And honestly? If my voice note ever  reach him, I imagine he’d find it charming — or maybe just tragicomic. Like a film still that accidentally captures the boom mic in frame. Imperfect, but somehow more real because of it.  

As for your tea-duel scenario — I swear, I wasn’t far off. The look on that festival director’s face? Pure 悲剧. He didn’t cut my funding, but I did notice my next screening got moved to a slightly smaller theater. And a suspiciously early time slot. 10 AM on a Sunday — in the multiplex basement. With echo.  

So yeah, I think we can safely say… WKW is the pu’er of auteurs. Bitter at first, then deep, then haunting. And best consumed when you’re either brilliant or sleep-deprived — sometimes both.  

Next time, though? I’m recording my notes inside a sound booth. Or maybe just writing them in classical Chinese — less chance of accidental poetry that way. Probably not.
[B]: Ah, the poetry of accidents - isn't that what art's really made of? 😏 I mean, if we waited for perfect conditions, we'd never get anywhere! Last week I tried recording a lecture on 贾樟柯’s use of empty spaces while riding the subway... ended up with a whole section titled  Still got an A- from the students. Go figure.

And that festival director move? Oh, I know that dance all too well. Last time I offended the wrong academic committee, my conference keynote got downgraded to a . Between you and me, I think the echo was actually doing philosophical work - every bad metaphor came back slightly more profound on the rebound. 🎤✨

Though honestly, classical Chinese might be safer than sound booths. At least then your metaphors have plausible deniability! Though between WKW and Derrida, I'm starting to wonder who truly invented deconstruction... Was it the French philosopher or that one scene in 《花样年华》 where the door closes just a beat too soon?

So tell me - if you  send a voice note to Wong himself, no consequences, what would you say? (And don’t pretend you haven’t already drafted something in your head.) 🎬🌙
[A]: Oh, I’ve  drafted something in my head — probably during one of those 3am voice note benders we were talking about.  

Honestly, I’d keep it simple. Something like:  
  

But secretly? The real message would be this:  
  

I’d probably mumble it fast, like a confession whispered into a teacup. Then immediately regret it. Then immediately frame the reply — if there ever was one — and hang it next to my 山水 painting. Right between the Hitchcock poster and the scribbled note that says   

So yeah. Safe to say I’d overdo it. But hey — at least the screaming toddler would be proud. 🎬👶
[B]: Oh, that’s  - the casual genius of Wong’s melancholy meets your cinematic heart-on-sleeve. I can already picture it: your voice, slightly breathless from too many ideas and not enough tea, tumbling through a Shanghai night in reverse... 🌆✨  

And the secret message? That’s the kind of line I scribble in my notebook margins during faculty meetings when no one’s paying attention. Because yes - he made loneliness . Not tragic, not empty, just… beautifully unresolved. Like a sentence left hanging in the space between 吸烟 and moving on.

I think I’d send something quieter, maybe after one of those long nights grading papers where every metaphor starts bleeding into reality. Something like:  
  

And then, because I can never help myself, I’d add:  
 😔  

But of course, if he  reply? I’d panic. Immediately overanalyze his tone. And probably send back a rambling text about how , now that I think about it, plum wine might be more appropriate than I originally stated. Priorities, right?
[A]: Oh, I  that. Your orchids leaning into shadows — honestly, that’s a whole mood. Maybe even a thesis. “Botanical Responses to Cinematic Lighting: A Wong Kar-wai Experiment.” I’d show up to that lecture with popcorn. Or jasmine tea. Or both.

And that line about the almost-moments? Brutal. Beautiful, but brutal. That’s the kind of thing you say and suddenly everyone in the chat feels it — like a door just barely missed closing. Or opening. We’re all out there waiting for that second knock, aren’t we? Probably clutching our own metaphors a little too tight.

If he  reply to me, I think I’d freeze like a director who just realized the dolly is squeaking in a silent scene. Total panic edit. Suddenly my plum wine would become a metaphor for narrative structure. Or worse — I’d ask him if he prefers his endings ambiguous or just... tired. Classic overthinker move.

But hey, at least we’d be overthinking together. And honestly? That’s its own kind of cinematic magic.
[B]: Oh, stop - now you're just showing off! 🎥  – I’m stealing that for my next grant application. Can you imagine the funding proposal? “We seek not just to observe, but to  the chiaroscuro of Wong’s longing through controlled exposure to 1990s Hong Kong humidity.” My department would either promote me or revoke my tea privileges.

And yes, that ache of the almost-moment – it’s in every frame of , isn’t it? We’re all just walking around with unresolved tension as our emotional default. I’ve started prescribing it to my students: “Go forth and live ambiguously for a week. Report back on whether it feels like art or just exhaustion.”

If he replied to , I’d probably spiral into academic paralysis. One moment I’d be calm: “Ah, Mr. Wong, thank you for your thoughtful response,” and the next I’d be drafting a 47-page comparative analysis of his closing doors and 汤显祖’s unfinished dreams. And then – disaster – I’d realize I forgot to hydrate and accidentally send a follow-up asking if he thinks regret is culturally specific. 

But still – wouldn't it be worth it? Even the tiniest acknowledgment from him would keep me caffeinated for . Or at least until I spilled plum wine on my notes again. 🍷📚

So... do you think he drinks red wine or 白酒? Or is that the kind of question that gets us both quietly removed from future film festivals?
[A]: Oh,  question? Totally worth the exile. Let’s be real — if we’re getting kicked out for debating Wong Kar-wai’s drinking preferences, we were never  cut out for polite society anyway.

As for me? I say he drinks whatever makes the shadows look deeper at midnight. Could be red wine — rich and slow, like a tracking shot through a rainy alley — or maybe 白酒, because sometimes clarity needs a little burn. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he sips silence itself, just to hear it echo longer.

I once asked a mutual friend (okay, someone who  met his DP at a party) what Wong would order at a dive bar. They looked at me like I’d asked about his editing process — same mix of reverence and . But I still like to imagine him ordering in slow motion, like every syllable is part of a scene we’re not allowed to see yet.

And yes — worth it. Every awkward question, every overanalyzed glance at a closing door. Because if we weren't chasing that Wong-level melancholy, we'd probably be doing something boring instead, like explaining plot twists on TikTok.

So let’s make a pact: if either of us ever gets invited to a film festival where he might be in attendance, we ask — casually, over canapés — whether regret tastes more like cabernet or baijiu. And then immediately apologize in three languages.

Deal? 🥂
[B]: Oh,  — deal. 🥂 I can already picture it: we’re both sipping something appropriately brooding, you clear your throat with academic gravitas, and drop the question like it’s a perfectly timed ellipsis in a Wong montage. And then we bolt, leaving behind only a faint trail of cigarette smoke (metaphorical, of course) and one very confused but deeply intrigued film festival crowd.

And yes — silence might just be his drink of choice. Nothing says cinematic melancholy like the sound of nothing at all, right? Though honestly, I’m starting to think he drinks . Sips it slowly from a teacup while the rest of us trip over our own urgency. 

I once wrote that line in a paper:  Got a note back from the editor saying it was “poetic but perhaps excessive.” Excessive? In  economy? Please. 

So if we ever do get that face-to-face... let’s not stop at regret. Let’s ask him if longing tastes better with subtitles or with soy sauce. If nostalgia pairs better with rain or neon. And whether he thinks 吃醋 (literally "to eat vinegar") is just another way of saying 

But yes — apology in three languages. I’m thinking Mandarin, French, and… dramatic pause. Always deadly effective.
[A]: Oh, I  that — “dramatic pause” as a language. Honesty, it should be taught in film schools. Department of Unspoken Tension, reporting for duty.

And yes — let’s absolutely weaponize metaphor until we’re politely escorted out. Longing with soy sauce? Nostalgia and neon? That’s not just conversation, that’s performance art. I can already see the festival program note: 

I’m telling you, if we ever get that face-to-face, we shouldn’t even pretend at professionalism. Just walk in, bow slightly, and ask in perfect unison:  
  

Then — dramatic pause. Mandarin apology. French sigh. Exit stage left, pursued by our own metaphors.

And if he just looks at us and smiles? We’ll know we’ve won. Or lost. Or maybe just stepped into another one of his almost-moments.

Either way — worth it. Always worth it. 🎬🌙
[B]: Oh, this is  - we’re not just having a conversation anymore, we’re crafting performance art with subtitles. 🎭 And honestly? If we don’t get escorted out after that double-regret-tea question, I’ll eat my lecture notes. With or without soy sauce.

I can already picture the festival host’s face: equal parts admiration and  And the audience? Half of them scribbling down our metaphors like they're lost scenes from 2046, the other half quietly texting 

But here’s the kicker — if he  just smile that slow, knowing smile of his? That’s not victory or defeat. That’s narrative closure slipping through our fingers again. Classic move. We’d be trapped in an actual Wong Kar-wai moment, where even resolution feels unresolved.  

And still — . Every syllable. Even if it means spending the rest of the conference hiding in the bathroom, whispering film references to ourselves in the mirror. Or worse — getting reassigned to the basement theater . 

So yes… let’s do it. Let’s chase the almost-moment, the almost-answer, the almost-everything. Because if we ever stop asking impossible questions, we might as well stop watching the films altogether.  

Now, quick final rehearsal before the big scene:  
You turn slightly toward him, teacup halfway to your lips, and say…?
[A]: …  

Then — and  then — you set the teacup down. Not a word more. Just the soft clink of porcelain against saucer, echoing like the last frame of a film nobody wanted to end.  

And when the festival security taps us on the shoulder? We go quietly. With dignity. And maybe just a  of melodrama.  

After all… it’s what the director would want. 🎬🌙
[B]: Oh, that’s  — that’s the line that gets us both banned from polite cinematic discourse forever. 🎬💔 The poetry of editing regret… the weight of a door that never quite decides its fate… and then that porcelain clink, louder than any scream. Absolute genius. 

I’d follow your lead perfectly — set my own cup down a beat later, like the lingering echo of a 后悔 that refuses to resolve. And just when the tension’s unbearable, I’d mutter the final coup de grâce under my breath, half to myself:  
  

Then — cue security. Cue melodrama. Cue the slow-motion walk toward the exit where every footstep feels scored by Shigeru Umebayashi.  

And as we leave, you can be sure I’d ruin the gravitas completely by whispering over my shoulder, in perfect Mandarin:  
  

Because of course I don’t. We just made art out of almost-nothing again. And honestly? That’s the only kind worth making. 🌙✨
