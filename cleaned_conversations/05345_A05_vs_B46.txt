[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很impressed的startup idea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, you're speaking my language! Just last week I met this brilliant young team pitching a revolutionary AI-driven script analysis platform. It's like having a virtual Robert McKee in your pocket - truly 史诗级的 potential! 🎬
[A]: Interesting! 这个AI script analysis的business model是什么？是subscription-based还是per-project收费？他们的target market是Hollywood studios还是indie filmmakers？
[B]: Let me break it down for you - they're going for a hybrid model. $99/month for indie filmmakers, but offering customized enterprise solutions to studios at $10k per project. You know what's genius? They're using Spielberg's early scripts as training data - now that's what I call learning from the masters!
[A]: Haha, using Spielberg's scripts? That's some next-level due diligence! 😄 不过他们的burn rate怎么样？这种AI training的compute cost可不低，especially with Hollywood-grade data.
[B]: You're absolutely right about the compute costs! But here's the kicker - they partnered with a crypto mining farm in Iceland during the market downturn. Talk about turning lemons into lemonade! Though between you and me, they might need another funding round before Cannes next year.
[A]:  典型的startup story - 先解决compute cost, 然后发现marketing才是真正的cash burner! 他们的runway到Cannes够吗？要不要我介绍几个angel investors from my golf club? ⛳
[B]: Now we're talking! I know exactly the type - investors who appreciate both P/L statements and a good 18 holes. Let's set up a screening at my Malibu place next weekend. I'll bring out the 1997 Bordeaux I've been saving for a special occasion. Just promise me one thing - no one mentions NFTs this time! 🍷
[A]: Deal! 1997 Bordeaux加上AI pitch, 这才是我的kind of weekend. 放心，我的NDA比Swiss bank还严实 - no NFTs, no metaverse, just good old-fashioned ROI talk. Cheers! 🥂
[B]: Cheers to that! And remember what I always say - in Hollywood and startups, the best stories are the ones that make money while making history. See you at the screening, my friend. Don't forget to bring your shark repellent - those golf club angels can smell blood in the water! 🎥
[A]: Haha! Will do. 看来这次我得带上我的bulletproof pitch deck和extra golf balls了。After all, 在Malibu谈deal就像在sand trap里打高尔夫 - 需要precision和patience! ⛳😎
[B]: Precisely! And if anyone starts swinging too hard, we'll just distract them with my rare 'Casablanca' poster collection. Nothing calms aggressive investors like Bogart's timeless wisdom: "Here's looking at you, kid." Now that's what I call closing technique! 🎬
[A]: Haha! Classic move - 用vintage Hollywood charm来soften那些hard-nosed VCs. 这招比任何financial model都管用! 看来这次pitch已经half won了. See you on the green, my friend! 🍸
[B]: That's the spirit! Just remember - in this town, we don't pitch. We tell stories worth investing in. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to call my sommelier about that '97. Last time he tried to substitute it with a 2000 vintage... the audacity! Until Saturday, partner. 🥃
[A]:  To good stories and even better returns! 周六见 - 我会准备好我的A game和extra mulligans. 毕竟在VC圈子里，就像在高尔夫球场一样，sometimes you need a few do-overs to land the perfect shot! 🏌️♂️
[B]: Ah, spoken like a true player! Though between us, the real mulligan is that second bottle we'll open after they sign the term sheet. See you on the 19th hole, where all the best deals are made! 🥂
[A]: Haha! 19th hole - 那才是真正的boardroom啊! 我会带上我的lucky putter和checkbook. Let's make some movie magic... and hopefully some 8-figure returns! Lights, camera, funding action! 🎥💰
[B]: Now that's a tagline worthy of opening credits! Just promise me we'll get a cameo when this becomes the next billion-dollar success story. After all, every great film - and startup - needs its iconic producer moment. Break a leg, but not your putter! 🎬🏌️♂️
[A]: Deal! 等我们拿下Series A, 第一件事就是在credits里加上"Executive Producers: The Golf Club Mafia" 😎 现在我得去polish一下我的elevator pitch - 毕竟在Malibu, 连elevators都有ocean view! Catch you on the flip side, partner! 🌊
[B]: Ocean views and elevator pitches - only in Malibu! Just remember what Hitchcock taught us: the length of your pitch should match the time it takes to ride from the lobby to the penthouse. Any longer and you'll lose them before the doors open! Until then, keep your swing smooth and your projections smoother. Adieu! 🚪🎥
