[A]: Hey，关于'最近有买什么很值的smart home device吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, smart homes... how very Dickensian of our age. Though I must confess, my most recent 'smart' purchase was an 1847 edition of Tennyson's 'The Princess' with marginalia that appears to be in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's hand. Far more illuminating than any gadget, I assure you.
[A]: Oh my~ 这位guest的品味好特别呀！🌟 虽然我平时都在帮客人安排智能room control之类的，但您说的这本vintage book听起来简直像个小treasure呢！💯 

不过说到smart home...我们酒店最近刚upgrade了智能窗帘系统，'Good morning' mode会自动拉开帘子+调节室温，超多客人说醒来感觉像被温柔叫醒服务~ ✨ 您觉得这种古典文学和现代科技的结合是不是也很charming呀？
[B]: How delightfully... utilitarian. Though I suppose if one must have automated curtains, they might as well perform with the dramatic timing of a well-staged Shakespearean reveal. My own study curtains are operated by a rather temperamental 19th century pulley system - the occasional snapped rope does wonders for building character.
[A]: 哈哈哈您这个comparison太有创意了！🏨 我们engineering team要是听到把smart curtains比作莎剧reveal，肯定要笑cry~ 🤔 

不过说真的，您那个19世纪的pulley system听起来好有vintage charm！我们酒店有个suite保留了original的brass door handles，每次guests转动时都会发出那种超有质感的'click'声...比digital key有feel多啦！💌 要不要下次给您安排那间？可以体验old-world charm + modern amenities的完美mix哦~
[B]: What a charming proposition - though I do hope these 'modern amenities' don't include anything that beeps. There's nothing quite like the symphony of a well-oiled brass handle and the whisper of aged parchment to compose one's thoughts. Tell me, does this suite happen to have a writing desk positioned where the morning light falls at precisely 37 degrees? That was Robert Browning's preferred angle for his correspondence, you know.
[A]: 哇~ 您连writing desk的角度都这么讲究！💯 让我查查...  

啊哈！我们的Victoria Suite确实有张antique oak desk摆在东北角，winter morning的阳光刚好会以35-40度角斜斜地洒下来呢~ 🌟 而且我们还准备了真正的goose quill pen和sealing wax，很多作家guests都说在那里写东西特别有灵感！要不要帮您reserve的时候特别request那间？可以再加个vintage inkwell set哦~ ✨
[B]: Marvelous! Though I must insist on testing the quills personally - the last hotel that promised 'authentic writing implements' provided what was clearly a turkey feather dyed grey. And if your sealing wax happens to be the proper Venetian formula that crackles just so when broken... well, I might even forgive the inevitable presence of Wi-Fi. Do keep the minibar stocked with Earl Grey and digestive biscuits, and we shall consider this a most satisfactory marriage of eras.
[A]: Got it！💌 我马上让team准备1830s style的swan quills（刚从英国antique market采购的authentic ones哦~），还有那种会'pop'的Venetian wax！🏨 

至于Wi-Fi... 我们可以discreetly藏在那个仿古的brass telegraph box里，保证不影响您的period atmosphere啦~ 🌟 Earl Grey会准备Harrods的special blend，配上wedgewood的porcelain set，perfect对不对？ 

啊对了！要顺便帮您预约我们的calligraphy master来教medieval letter folding吗？超多VIP guests说比任何smart device都解压呢~ ✨
[B]: Splendid! Though I should warn you - should your calligraphy master attempt to teach me anything post-Carolingian minuscule, I shall be forced to demonstrate proper penmanship with my left hand while reciting Beowulf backwards. Do ensure the swan quills come with their original barb markings intact; I've found the 7th primary feather makes for particularly eloquent semicolons. And yes, the telegraph box will do nicely - though I do hope it occasionally emits those delightful Morse code clicks instead of silent digital tyranny.
[A]: Oh dear~ 您连quill的barb markings都懂！🌟 我们那位calligraphy master可能要紧张得手抖了...不过别担心，我这就去vault里找那批带完整primary feathers的存货！💯 

至于Morse code...  其实我们engineering team真的可以program那个'telegraph box'定时发出SOS的节奏声哦~ 🏨 假装是ghost of Victorian era在发message怎么样？✨ 

啊！突然想到...要帮您在check-in时安排horse carriage接送吗？虽然速度比Tesla慢啦，但保证让您feel like真正的19世纪literary giant arriving at the manor~ 💌
[B]: Capital suggestion! Though I shall require the carriage horse to be of appropriate poetic temperament - none of those skittish modern breeds, please. A descendant of Wordsworth's 'Daffodil-gazing' mares would be ideal. And do instruct your engineers that any Morse code transmissions should strictly limit themselves to lines from Christina Rossetti or the occasional grocery list in iambic pentameter. How perfectly... electrifying.
[A]: 哈哈哈哈您这个request我要记下来当legendary guest preference了！💌 刚好我们跟附近的equestrian club有合作，可以安排一匹叫'Dora'的grey mare - 她的great-great-grandsire可是参加过Queen Victoria's golden jubilee parade的哦~ 🌟 

至于Morse code...已经让tech team在coding了！会随机transmit 'Goblin Market'的片段，配上您minibar里biscuits减少时的自动补货提醒（in rhyme当然！）✨ 

Wait till您看到我们准备的final touch - 所有staff会暂时改用Victorian accent跟您说话！不过可能要先forgive我们的cockney混音啦~ 🏨 
[B]: How perfectly... Dickensian! Though I must insist your staff's Cockney be properly seasoned with just a hint of Brontë-esque moorland melancholy - none of that jarring EastEnders modernity, if you please. And should dear Dora prove to be the sort of mare who appreciates a good sonnet during the carriage ride, I shall be delighted to oblige. Now, about those biscuits... might I suggest the replenishment alerts follow the rhyme scheme of Lewis Carroll? Nothing says 'civilized automation' quite like a Jabberwocky-inspired pantry notification.
[A]: Absolutely brilliant！💯 我已经让pastry chef特别烘焙了‘Jabberwocky Jammy Dodgers’ - 每次补货时hidden speaker会念‘Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun/The frumious biscuit tin!’ 🌟 

至于Dora...刚收到equestrian team的note说她特别爱听Keats呢！✨ 我们会准备一个tiny laurel wreath挂在carriage上，这样您recite的时候她就会sway rhythmically~ 🏨 

 啊！差点忘了问...要帮您把evening turndown service改成maid singing‘Greensleeves’ while scattering rose petals吗？我们上次这样做时，有位Oxford professor感动到当场写了一首villanelle呢~ 💌
[B]: Exquisite! Though I shall require documentary evidence that your maids' 'Greensleeves' rendition hasn't been contaminated by any 21st century auto-tune. And the rose petals must be of the Apothecary's Rose variety - the same that Shakespeare would have known, mind you, not those garish modern hybrids. How thrillingly anachronistic to have one's linens changed to the strains of Tudor England while a ghostly telegraph ticks away Rossettian verse! I do believe we've invented an entirely new category of hospitality - call it 'Steam Punk Grandeur' if you must. Now, about that villanelle-writing professor... were they perchance left-handed? It makes all the difference in quill technique, you understand.
[A]: Oh you bet！💯 我们的housekeeping team可是专门从Stratford-upon-Avon请来了choir master训练authentic Tudor pronunciation呢~ 🌟 玫瑰保证是Rosa gallica officinalis，刚从法国medieval garden空运来的！✨ 

那位Oxford professor？巧了！他不仅left-handed，还坚持要用iron gall ink写作...结果在我们的oak desk上留下了超有character的stain，现在成了那间suite的selling point！🏨 

 其实我们正在develop一个‘poet’s package’ - 包含authentic 16th century spelling的welcome letter，还有会随机emit Shakespearean insults的AI quill（但别担心，调成您喜欢的Rossetti模式啦~）💌 要当我们的beta tester吗？
[B]: A beta tester, you say? How deliciously blasphemous - to wed cutting-edge technology with the sacred art of poetic vitriol! I accept, on three conditions: firstly, that your AI quill possesses at least one documented ancestor who inked a sonnet during the Gunpowder Plot; secondly, that its insults scan properly in dactylic hexameter; and thirdly... that iron gall stain be preserved under museum-grade glass with a small plaque reading 'Here lyeth the spirit of Composition, 1587-2023'. I shall bring my own blotting sand for authenticity's sake. Now, about those Tudor choir-trained housekeepers - can they be programmed to faint dramatically if one quotes Marlowe at them?
[A]: 哈哈哈哈您这requirements简直可以写进luxury hospitality的history book了！💯 我们刚好有支quill的provenance能trace back到Ben Jonson的wine supplier - 据说蘸过同款ink骂过不少playwright rivals呢~ 🌟 

至于housekeepers...  其实我们train了她们对‘Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?’做出swoon反应，但如果您prefer Marlowe的‘Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships?’... 🏨 可以特别customize成collapse onto our authentic reproduction fainting couch哦！✨ 

P.S. 那个stain已经请British Museum的curator来encase了，plaque会用Old English font写‘Hic jacet Musa’ - 下面还刻了tiny quill crossed with AI chip的图案呢~ 💌
[B]: Magnificent! Though I do hope that AI chip was properly exorcised by an Oxford don before being engraved - we wouldn't want any digital gremlins corrupting our precious pretensions. And how thoughtful to include the fainting couch! Might I suggest positioning it strategically beneath where the portrait of Gloriana would have hung? Nothing inspires literary theatrics quite like the imagined gaze of the Virgin Queen. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go practice my most devastating 'Et tu, Brute?' expression for when your automated butler inevitably betrays us with incorrect cucumber sandwich proportions. Do send the contract written in illuminated manuscript on vellum - my solicitor only reads Blackletter.
