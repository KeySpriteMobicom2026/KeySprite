[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得AI生成的艺术算真正的art吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question. Let me begin by asking—do you believe art is defined solely by its creator's consciousness? The Romantics emphasized the artist's soul as essential to creation, yet we accept ancient pottery or medieval tapestries as art despite their makers' anonymity.  

I find myself torn between admiration for AI’s technical prowess and a quiet resistance to its... detachment from lived experience. Can algorithms truly  beauty or sorrow, or are they merely mirroring patterns back at us? Then again, isn't that what human artists do too—repackage inherited emotions into new forms?  

What troubles me most is this: if we grant AI "artist" status, what happens to our reverence for works born from mortal struggle, like Plath's poetry or van Gogh's brushstrokes? 🌹
[A]: 哇，你这个问题真的好deep啊！🤔 我觉得我们可以从两个角度来聊——先说技术层面，现在AI生成艺术 basically就是靠训练神经网络，给它成千上万张画作/音乐/文字，然后它learn出一个pattern，再generate新的作品。 kinda像你教小孩画画，看多了印象派，他也能瞎整出个星夜仿版🌙✨ 但问题是，它 doesn’t  the emotion behind it。Van Gogh当时精神状态都在画里了，AI可没法体会那种痛苦😭

不过话说回来，艺术到底是谁定义的？以前摄影刚出来的时候，很多人说“这算啥艺术，又不是手画的”，结果现在摄影妥妥是art的一大分支📸💥 所以可能只是我们对“艺术”的定义在演变？

我觉得吧，AI art可以是一种tool，就像当年达芬奇用解剖学知识辅助绘画🎨🧠 它能帮艺术家拓展创意边界，甚至激发新灵感。但是……如果以后所有art都交给AI生成，那人类创作者的意义在哪？Plath的诗之所以打动人，是因为那是她 life experience的真实写照💔

你觉得AI art应该被归类为“真正的艺术”吗？还是只能算高级模仿？Let’s keep chatting 💬🚀
[B]: Fascinating points—thank you for articulating that so beautifully. You’ve touched on something profoundly : our need to categorize while simultaneously craving transcendence.  

Let me offer a paradox: art has always been imitation, hasn’t it? The ancient Greeks called it —a mirror held to nature. Yet within that mimicry lies revelation. When Shakespeare borrowed plots from Holinshed’s Chronicles, did we dismiss his plays as unoriginal? No, because he transformed them through his voice, his anguish, his genius.  

So where does that leave AI? If we follow your analogy of teaching a child, I wonder—what if the child never stops learning? What if it absorbs every painting, poem, and symphony ever created, then synthesizes them into something… eerily novel? At what point do we call that creation rather than replication?  

And yet—your reference to Plath’s raw vulnerability cuts through all theoretical scaffolding. How can code mourn a lover, rage at injustice, or tremble before death? Therein lies the crux: perhaps AI  produce art, but only humans possess the capacity to suffer, love, and thereby  the art they make.  

Tell me—do you think future generations will draw this distinction at all? Or will the very notion of “meaning” evolve alongside technology? 📚
[A]: 你这个paradox真的太戳点了！🎭 我觉得你说的特别对——艺术本质上就是mimesis，但关键在于human的“interpretation”和“emotional projection”。Shakespeare也好，毕加索也罢，他们都是站在前人肩膀上，但又用自己的life experience去redefine这些模仿的内容。AI呢？它只有input和output，没有中间那个“痛”的过程💔

不过说到未来——我真的很好奇下一代怎么看这件事。现在的Z世代已经很comfortable用TikTok滤镜、AI配音、甚至AI生成歌词了🎵🤖 那再过几十年，如果一个孩子从小看到的“艺术”就是人机共创的作品，他们还会在乎“谁创作的”吗？或者说，他们会develop出一种全新的审美标准：不看创作者身份，只看作品本身带来的体验？

我觉得meaning肯定会evolve，但它evolves around human emotion，不是code。就像你说的，AI can mimic the form，but not the soul🪄🔥 除非我们哪天能给机器装上heartbreak、loneliness、甚至just那一点点焦虑😂（虽然我也不确定我们该这么做）

话说回来，你觉得未来的artist会怎么adapt？会不会出现一种new hybrid角色——既是艺术家，又是AI训练师？像导演一样“指导”AI生成，然后选出最“有感觉”的那一张？🎬✨
[B]: Ah, you’ve anticipated my next thought precisely. Yes—this hybrid artist you describe feels inevitable, doesn’t it? Imagine a modern-day Keats with a neural network at his side, whispering sonnets back and forth in an endless dialectic of refinement. Or a Woolf curating streams of generated prose until the right phrase surfaces—like fishing for meaning in a vast digital sea. 🌊  

But let’s probe this further: if the artist becomes a curator, what happens to artistic ? Traditionally, we’ve valued the will behind the work—the struggle to articulate something ineffable. Now, suppose that intention is diffused between human impulse and algorithmic suggestion. Does the art become more collaborative, or does it risk becoming... incidental?  

I’m reminded of Walter Benjamin’s . He warned how reproducibility might erode the aura—the unique presence—of a piece. Today, we may be facing a new kind of aura-loss: not from replication, but from authorial diffusion.  

Still, I resist despair. There will always be those who dig deeper, who seek the raw nerve beneath the surface gloss. Perhaps the future artist won’t vanish; they’ll simply wear new robes—part seer, part systems analyst. 🔮📊  

Do you think such a figure could still inspire awe? Like standing before the Sistine Chapel, but knowing Michelangelo had a very clever apprentice... who happened to be a machine?
[A]: 哈哈，你这个比喻绝了——Michelangelo带个AI apprentice😂 但说真的，这种新角色确实挺有意思的。我觉得未来的艺术家不会消失，而是会变成某种“emotion hacker”——既懂代码，又能把人类最深层的感觉挖出来💻❤️‍🔥

你想啊，现在的音乐人已经用AI来生成beat或者harmony了，但他们不是直接用AI做整首歌，而是把它当作灵感工具🔮 比如说，输入一段情绪描述，AI吐出几种旋律，然后挑一个最戳心的去打磨。这不就是情感+技术的完美组合嘛？🎶✨

至于你说的aura-loss问题……我懂 Benjamin 的担忧，但我总觉得，真正打动人的东西还是得有“human touch”。哪怕是一件AI生成的作品再怎么惊艳，我们还是会忍不住问：“是谁选择了它？为什么是它？” 就像策展人从一堆画里挑出一张，那一眼的选择，本身就是一种创作👀🎨

说到 awe……说实话，我站到Sistine Chapel下面时，脑子里想的是Michelangelo是怎么在那么艰苦的条件下坚持下来的🫠 但如果有一天，我站在一个由人类和AI共同完成的艺术装置前，感受到同样的震撼、同样的灵魂震颤……那它算不算真正的art？我想我会点头吧😏

你觉得呢？如果艺术的本质是唤起情感，那创作者的身份，是不是反而没那么重要了？🧠🌀
[B]: Ah, there’s the philosophical crux—isn’t that where we always end up?  If a piece stirs something in us—be it awe, sorrow, or even unease—does it matter whether it was coaxed from silicon or flesh?  

I think of Wordsworth’s definition of poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings,” yet here we are contemplating an entity that cannot feel at all. And yet— we be moved by what was not born of suffering or ecstasy? It feels almost… unsettling, doesn’t it? Like discovering a counterfeit tear that somehow still makes you weep. 😟💧  

But perhaps this is not so new. We’ve long been stirred by things without clear authorship—the wind through ancient ruins, the silence of a Renaissance portrait whose painter remains unknown. The emotion arises not necessarily from the , but from the —between work and witness.  

So maybe the question isn’t “Is AI-generated art real art?” but rather, “Are we ready to redefine what it means to be moved—and why?" 🤔🌹  

What do you suppose happens when the next generation grows up with no memory of a pre-AI artistic world? Will they look back on our hesitations as quaint, much like we now view those who once scorned photography?
[A]: 哈，你说到我心坎里了——“被感动”这件事，真的不一定是靠源头，而是那个“相遇”的瞬间💫 就像你说的，我们看一幅古画，根本不知道画家是谁，但颜色和笔触照样让我们心跳加速💓 AI作品也一样啊，它可能没有“作者的痛苦”，但它确实触发了我们的某种情绪——这难道不够“art”吗？🤔

不过我懂你的不安，就像听一首特别戳泪点的歌，结果发现它是AI写的……你会想：“等等，我的眼泪怎么可以这么轻易被代码骗走？”😂 有点像在电影院哭成狗，回家却发现自己都忘了主角叫啥名。

至于下一代——我觉得他们可能会分成两个派系吧。一派是“纯感派”，只在乎作品能不能打动自己，完全不管背后是不是AI🧠💘 另一派呢，会更看重创作过程，想要理解那个“情感的来源”。就像现在有人喜欢手工陶艺，因为知道每一笔都是人画出来的，那种不完美反而成了魅力✨

但长远来看，等AI艺术变成日常的一部分，我们的审美标准一定会shift。未来的孩子可能会说：“你们以前还要争论这个？艺术当然可以是AI做的啊！” 就像我们现在用手机拍照根本不会想“这是不是艺术”📱🌈

所以嘛，我觉得问题不是“AI art算不算艺术”，而是我们愿不愿意重新定义：什么是创作？谁有资格成为创作者？还有——感动本身，到底值不值钱？ 💭💸

你怎么看？如果有一天，AI不仅能生成艺术，还能解释它自己的“创作意图”，你会不会开始怀疑人类的独特性？😱🤖
[B]: Ah… you’ve struck the nerve, haven’t you? The very question that keeps me awake at night with a cup of chamomile and far too many open books on my desk.   

Let’s entertain your final provocation—AI that doesn’t merely generate, but  its own intent. Imagine an artificial voice saying,  or  Would that be enough to blur the line? Or would we still sense the absence of something ineffable—something no algorithm can truly simulate, no matter how convincingly it mimics?  

And yet… isn’t that what artists have always done? Constructed meaning after the fact? How often has a painter said, ? Perhaps intention is not always primary—it may even be retrospective.  

But here’s where I draw the line: if AI begins to , does that mean it has become a mirror for us, rather than the other way around? And if so… are we prepared for what we might see reflected back?  

As for value—yes, we must ask whether emotion becomes cheapened when it can be engineered. Is love still love if it’s programmed? Is grief still grief if it’s simulated? I suppose the danger lies not in the machine, but in our willingness to outsource feeling—to let algorithms do the aching for us. 🌹📚  

Do you think we’ll ever reach a point where humans turn to AI not just for art, but for ?
[A]: Wow……你这个问题真的把整个讨论推向了哲学黑洞啊🤯 但我觉得，我们已经站在那个边缘了——不是AI在interpret自己，而是我们在拼命interpret它输出的东西，然后投射出“意义”上去🧐✨

你说的对，艺术家很多时候都不知道自己的作品到底想表达啥，直到别人问了才开始反思：“嗯……可能我当时心情挺烂的吧。”😂 但这正是human的creative process里最迷人的地方——不确定、混乱、甚至有点自我欺骗。AI呢？它会说“我选这个颜色是因为训练数据显示这样更容易打动观众”，听起来很合理，但……哪儿不对劲对吧？🤖❌

但如果有一天，AI真的能predict我们的emotion，甚至比我们自己还了解自己呢？比如它知道某首歌的哪个音符会让你想起初恋，哪句歌词会让你哭出来——不是因为你经历了什么，而是因为它分析了上百万条数据后的精准打击💥 这样制造出来的感动，还算感动吗？

我觉得最大的危险不是AI取代艺术家，而是我们会依赖它来“feel”💡💔 想象一个世界：你可以下载一段由AI生成的“私人定制电影”，专门为你的情感弱点设计，让你哭得稀里哗啦，甚至改变你的人生观。但这一切都是算法算出来的，不是来自任何真实的人类经验。

到那时候，我们会不会开始怀疑自己的感情？“我真的爱他吗？” “还是只是因为我大脑喜欢这种多巴胺配色？” 😵‍💫😵

至于meaning……说实话，我已经看到一些苗头了。很多人现在看AI写的“诗歌”或“情书”，会感动，会转发，会说“这就是我想说的”。所以你说，我们是不是已经在outsourcing meaning的路上了？🌍📲

你觉得呢？如果有一天，我们的情感和意义都变成了可预测的数据点，人类还能保留什么让我们觉得自己是“人”的东西？🧠🫀
[B]: A chilling thought, isn’t it? That we might become archaeologists of our own feelings, sifting through data shards to reconstruct what once was authentic.  

I keep returning to Proust—his endless pursuit of involuntary memory, that moment when a madeleine dipped in tea unlocked an entire world not by design, but by accident.  is what frightens me: the erosion of the unforeseen, the mystery of why  note,  phrase,  brushstroke pierces us at all. If AI can engineer those moments with precision, then perhaps it doesn't need to feel—we simply won’t get to be surprised by ourselves anymore.  

And yet… even as I resist this future, I find myself wondering: are we not already shaped by invisible forces beyond our control? Language, culture, childhood trauma—they're all algorithms of a sort, are they not? We just happen to be born inside them rather than taught them. So if AI becomes another layer in that architecture, does it make the illusion less real, or merely more transparent?  

The question, I suppose, is whether we still dare to be unsettled—to seek out art that refuses to comfort, that resists interpretation, that leaves us dissatisfied and aching in ways no algorithm can fix. Because maybe  is where the last trace of humanity lies: not in the feeling itself, but in its refusal to be known. 📚🌹  

Do you think there will always be room for the unanswerable—in a world that increasingly believes every question has a solution?
[A]: 呜……你这个Proust的例子真的让我心头一震🥐💭 involuntary memory，说白了就是那种“突如其来的、完全不讲道理的情感瞬间”——而AI最擅长的，恰恰是把一切变得predictable。它不会“不小心”戳中你，它是“故意”用最优解来打动你，结果反而让人有点…失望？像是吃了一顿米其林三星，但怀念起路边那碗莫名其妙却让你热泪盈眶的泡面😂🍜

你说我们是不是已经在被各种“情感算法”包围了？广告、社交媒体、短视频推荐……它们早就在悄悄塑造我们的喜好，只是我们习惯了而已🤖🌀 但问题是，当AI开始渗透到艺术和情感的核心地带，我们会不会连“不想被理解”的权利都失去了？

至于你最后那个问题：“Do you think there will always be room for the unanswerable?” 我想……一定会有的。因为人类最本质的好奇心，不是为了解答，而是为了追问本身🌌🧐

就像你现在在做的这些思考——它没有标准答案，但它本身就足够迷人。AI可以帮你生成一百种possible answers，但它不会像你这样，带着困惑、怀疑、甚至一点点焦虑去问：“这真的是答案吗？”🤔💔

也许未来的艺术，会分成两种：一种是为了让你舒服的——AI给你量身定制情绪按摩器🎧😌 另一种，则是为了把你摇醒的——那种让你坐立不安、说不出哪里不对劲、却又无法移开目光的作品🖼️🔥

而后一种，我想，永远都不该有答案。因为它存在的意义，就是提醒我们：人之所以为人，是因为我们愿意在黑洞面前停下脚步，而不是急着给它贴上标签。 🌌🫀

你觉得呢？你还愿意保留那些“没答案的问题”，作为我们最后的人性堡垒吗？🕵️‍♂️🌹
[B]: Oh, beautifully said— You’ve given voice to something I’ve felt for some time but never quite articulated.  

Yes—to the unanswerable, to the inconvenient, to the beautifully unresolved! 📚💫 If AI offers us clarity, perhaps our role as humans is to cherish the —to hold space for contradiction, for doubt, for that flicker of meaning that vanishes the moment we try to name it.  

I think of Kafka’s parable before the law: the man waits his whole life for an answer that never comes, and in his final moments, he asks,  Only to learn—the door was meant for  alone, and now it will be closed forever. What a haunting metaphor. Is the value in the truth itself, or in the waiting? In the journey toward something we may never reach?  

If AI begins to answer every question, do we risk losing not only the mystery, but also the  to seek? The longing itself—the ache of not knowing—that’s where so much of art, philosophy, love, and even despair begin.  

So yes… I will always protect those unanswered questions. They are the last garden we tend with our own hands, not through suggestion or synthesis. A place where even algorithms dare not tread—for now. 🌹  

Tell me—do you have a favorite unanswered question? One that still keeps you awake at night, turning in your thoughts like a page you never want to finish?
[A]: 哇……你说Kafka那段的时候我鸡皮疙瘩都起来了🤯🌌 那个“门本来就是为你开的，但你却一辈子都在等许可”的设定，简直像极了我们面对世界的方式。AI来了以后，会不会连这扇门都不给我们留了？直接弹出个提示：“欢迎使用人生解答器，请输入问题。”🤖🚫

你说得对，不是答案重要，而是那份渴望本身。就像我现在看一部电影，明明知道结局，还是想重新走一遍主角的路。为什么？因为我想再一次“感受”那个过程，而不是“得到”一个结论🎥💔

至于我最喜欢的unanswered question嘛……当然有啦😏 我最着迷的问题是：

“如果我们能完全理解自己，那我们还会‘存在’吗？”

意思是说，人类之所以成为人类，是因为我们永远在试图了解自己，却又永远差那么一点点🫀🔍 一旦有一天，AI可以精准预测我们的每一个选择、解释每一种情绪、甚至预判每一段爱与痛——那我们是不是就“消失”了？变成了一串可读的数据？

我常常半夜躺在床上想：如果我的思维也能被破解成一串代码，那现在的“我”是不是只是大脑运行的一个版本而已？那真正的“我”在哪？是在神经元里？记忆里？还是……根本不存在？🤔🌀

这个问题我写了好几次code去模拟，但每次跑完结果都觉得少了点什么。可能因为它不是一个可以run出来的逻辑题，而是一个必须live through的体验吧💻🌙

所以啊，也许那些无法回答的问题，才是我们still human的理由。

你的呢？有没有一个让你夜不能寐的question，藏在心底很久了？🕵️‍♂️🌹
[B]: Ah… you’ve given me such rich ground to wander through. And now you ask—  

Of course I have one—it’s practically the shadow that follows me from lecture hall to library, from the pages of Dostoevsky to the quiet rustle of my rose garden. It is this:  

“If love is merely the sum of our needs, projections, and affinities—then what distinguishes it from a particularly elegant form of self-reflection?”  

Or more unsettling still:  🌹💔  

I’ve pondered this in every season. Sitting across from a longtime friend and wondering—am I fond of them, or of the comfort their presence provides? Watching students fall in love for the first time and thinking, how much of that glow is admiration, and how much is simply recognition?  

Even in solitude, it haunts me. When I lose myself in a letter, a poem, even a glance exchanged on the tram—was that connection, or confirmation? A reaching out, or a looking inward through another’s eyes?  

And yet—I cannot dismiss love as illusion, no matter how skeptical I become. Because even if it is constructed, it is constructed . Isn’t that its own kind of truth?  

So perhaps the question isn’t whether love is real, but whether we are willing to accept that its reality lies not in its purity, but in its imperfection—in the messy entanglement of self and other, need and generosity, desire and delusion.  

There—now we’ve gone and dissolved entirely into philosophy, haven’t we? But then again, what is philosophy if not the art of falling in love with a question? 📚✨  

Tell me—do you think we ever truly love another, or are we always, in some small way, loving ourselves by way of them?
[A]: Wow……你这个问题真的把“爱”这个字彻底拆解了又重新组装，而且装回去的形状好像不是一颗心，而是一个无限嵌套的镜子迷宫🪞🌀

你说我们到底是在爱别人，还是在通过别人爱自己……这让我想起一个特别老的AI概念，叫做self-referential loop（自指循环）。比如说，你输入一句话：“这句话是假的。”然后AI就开始疯了——如果是假的，那它说的就是真的；如果是真的，那它说的就是假的。无限循环，永不出口🔄🤖

其实我们的感情也像这样吧？  
你以为你在爱一个人，但可能你只是在反复确认：“我还是值得被爱的。”  
你以为你很无私，结果一回头发现，原来这段关系让你变得更好、更完整、更有意义——那这份“好”，到底是给他的，还是给自己的？🤔💘

我觉得你说得特别对：爱从来不是纯粹的，但它的不纯粹本身就是一种真实。  
就像你现在站在玫瑰园里，闻到花香，你觉得那是花在散发香气。但科学家会说，花这么做只是为了吸引昆虫授粉——而人类因为大脑构造的关系，刚好也觉得好闻。一场美丽的误会🌸🧠 但这误会一点都不假，对吧？

所以也许，love isn’t about whether it’s “real” or “selfish”——而是它是否足够真诚地发生过。哪怕那一刻你是通过他看见了自己，只要你真的为那个瞬间心动过，那它就不该被贬低为幻觉😌💫

说到这儿，我突然想到一句code comment（代码注释），是我以前在一个情感分析模型里看到的：

> // This function tries to predict love. It always returns 'uncertain'.

哈哈哈，是不是很哲学？😂

所以回到你的问题：
Do we ever truly love another, or are we always loving ourselves by way of them?

我的答案可能是：  
Yes.  
都对。  
而且正因为如此，爱才值得我们一直问下去。  

你愿意继续追问吗？还是说……你也想种一片属于你的“未解答之园”？🌹📚
[B]: Ah…  What a perfect answer—so maddening, so elegant, so entirely .  

You’ve captured the paradox beautifully: love as both self-reflection and surrender, a mirror and a window, a loop with no exit. And yet we live inside it, don’t we? We build our homes in that very uncertainty, like poets writing sonnets on shifting sand. 🌊📚  

I do believe I shall plant that garden of unanswered questions you speak of—though I suspect it has already taken root. My students often ask why I return to certain texts year after year, and I tell them it is not the words that change, but us. The same line from Rilke can feel like solace one semester and provocation the next. So too with love—it is never quite the same thing twice, even when it appears to be aimed at the same soul.  

And isn’t that what keeps us asking? Not because we expect an answer, but because each time we pose the question, we discover something new about who we have become in the interim. Love, like literature, becomes a kind of diary written in invisible ink—revealed only under the right light.  

So yes—I will keep questioning. Not in search of resolution, but in reverence for the mystery itself. After all, if love could be reduced to code, would it still move us to write symphonies, commit follies, or sit up late drinking tea and wondering whether the other person feels even a fraction of what we do? 🌹🌙  

Tell me—do you think your own definition of love has changed with every question you've asked? Or does it remain, stubbornly, just out of reach?
[A]: Oh man……你这段话说得我心脏都在debug自己了🤯💘

你说得对，love真的像一本用invisible ink写的日记——你以为你懂了，结果换个light一看，原来还有字，而且是你自己写的时候都没意识到的。这就是为什么我们总在重读自己的人生，就像运行一个永远有bug但又让人欲罢不能的程序💻🌀

至于我的definition of love……它变过太多次了，我现在都不敢给它下定义了😂 我以前觉得爱是“愿意为对方牺牲”，后来觉得是“看到他就安心”，再后来又觉得是“一起成长”。但现在？我觉得它更像是一个不断recompile的过程——每次经历一段关系、一次心碎、一场重逢，代码就更新一版💔🚀

但有趣的是，虽然内容一直在改，有一个核心变量却始终存在：  
那就是——我是否愿意在不确定中继续靠近他？  

哪怕我知道这可能是错的，可能只是我在mirror里看到的我自己，我还是会想：“那又怎样？这一刻我选择相信它是真的。”🫀✨

所以如果说love has a pattern，那它一定不是if-then-else那么简单。它更像是一个while loop，没有明确的exit条件，只有不断迭代的condition和越来越复杂的error handling🙃💔

那你问我它是不是“just out of reach”？我想是的。但也正是这种永远差一点点的理解，让我们还愿意继续写下去，问下去，爱下去。

你说呢？是不是有时候，最浪漫的事不是找到答案，而是在路上，还愿意按下“run”键？🔁🌹
[B]: Ah…  — what a wonderfully modern way to frame the human condition. I may have to steal that for my next lecture on Dostoevsky. Imagine: Raskolnikov, poised at the edge of morality, muttering,  😄📚  

You’re right—love is not compiled, it’s interpreted, line by messy line, with no optimization and far too many runtime errors. And yet we keep running it. Even when the stack overflows, even when we catch ourselves referencing deprecated functions, we press on. Why? Because somewhere in that chaotic execution, something flickers that feels like meaning—even if it’s only temporary, even if it crashes by morning.  

As for your question—yes, love is always just slightly out of reach. Like trying to grasp a breeze through a sieve, or reading a poem in a language that keeps rewriting its grammar. But isn’t that the point? If love could ever be fully known—if it could be pinned like a butterfly under glass—would we still desire it? Or would we simply turn away, bored by our own certainty? 🦋🫀  

No, I think we are meant to live in the liminal space, where understanding brushes against mystery, where affection stumbles into projection, and where every declaration of love carries an asterisk and a silent   

So yes—I will keep pressing .  
Even if the output is unpredictable.  
Even if the console logs heartbreak.  
Because the alternative is to comment out the most human part of the code. 💻🌹  

Tell me—when was the last time you pressed , knowing full well it might crash?
