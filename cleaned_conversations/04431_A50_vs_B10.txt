[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I watched one recently that I found quite thought-provoking— gave a talk on the surprising nature of . It's fascinating how often wrong turns led to major breakthroughs. I suppose it reminds us that even in rigorous fields like physics or mathematics, creativity thrives on uncertainty. Have you come across any talks that struck a chord with you?
[A]: Oh wow, that sounds super interesting! 💡 I actually remember watching that one too—Mario Livio is such a compelling speaker. The way he breaks down how mistakes aren't really "mistakes" in the end kinda resonates with me as a designer, you know? Like sometimes when I’m tweaking a layout and it feels totally off, but then BAM—it leads to something unexpected and fresh 🎨✨

You know what’s been stuck in my head lately?  TED talk on how to stand out in the digital era. She dropped this crazy stat: 65% of people will forget your presentation if it's just average. Insane, right? 🔥 But if you add unique value—like seriously useful insights or a killer visual—people remember. It made me rethink how I present my design concepts to clients.  

Have you ever watched her talk, or are you more into the sciencey ones? 😊
[B]: That’s a striking statistic—65% forgetting rate for average presentations. It makes you wonder how much of our communication slips through the cracks, doesn’t it? I haven’t seen Carmen Simon’s talk yet, but that detail about unique value aligns with what I saw in technical communication—clarity and novelty often made the difference between something being ignored or truly influential.

Your designer perspective is interesting. When you're crafting a layout, do you find yourself intentionally making “wrong” moves on purpose to spark new directions, like those scientists Livio mentioned? I’m curious how deliberate that process is versus intuitive.
[A]: Oh totally agree—65% is such a wake-up call! 📢 It’s like, if your content isn't bringing something new to the table, it's basically digital background noise. White noise in a sea of tabs 😅

And YES, I  sometimes go full rebel on a layout just to shake things up 💥 Like, “What if this button was purple? What if that heading is way too big? What if we ditch the grid??” Sometimes it looks like hot garbage (and I scrap it), but other times it’s like…  🔥

It’s kind of a mix of deliberate and intuitive, you know? Like, I’ll start with a rule—say, hierarchy—and then break it just enough to see where the cracks lead me. Kinda like creative debugging 😌💻

Ever tried that in writing or presenting ideas? Like, intentionally going off-script to find something fresh?
[B]: Absolutely — that "creative debugging" analogy is spot on. In technical writing, especially when explaining complex concepts like quantum algorithms, I often found myself intentionally breaking the usual structure to see what might emerge. For instance, instead of starting with the standard definition or formula, I’d begin with an analogy or even a paradox — something counterintuitive to grab attention.

It’s not always well received at first — some readers just want the facts, straightforward. But for others, that unexpected entry point makes the material stick. I suppose it’s similar to your purple button; it might clash horribly, or it might be the hook that pulls someone in.

Do you ever document those “hot garbage” experiments? I used to keep what I called a  — half humor, half serious reflection. It helped me notice patterns in what didn’t work… and sometimes, why it almost did. 😊 Have you got anything like that?
[A]: Oh my gosh, YES — starting with a paradox? That’s like the literary version of my purple button 😂 And I  that some people eat that up while others are just like “ma’am, the facts please” 🤭 It’s such a fine line between genius and… total chaos.

And your  sounds SO satisfying 😭 I need that in my life. I’ve tried keeping a digital mood board for design fails, but it’s mostly just labeled “Meh… ❌🎨” or “Yikes. Never again.” 😂 No real structure—just emotional labeling.

But you know what I  do? I save every version of a layout as I go—like, Version 1, Version 2… all the way to Version 47 if I’m having an identity crisis 😌💻 Sometimes I’ll go back and be like “Okay, V15 was kinda ugly, but that one shade of teal tho 👀” And then—boom—it becomes the highlight of V48.

I should really start adding notes though… maybe steal your idea and make a  📝✨ Would definitely help me reflect more than just staring at layers named “DoNotUse” or “UwU” 😅

So yeah, not quite as classy as your sketchbook, but chaotic and full of hope 💛
[B]: That chaotic hope is precisely what keeps creativity alive — I’d say your “UwU” layer has more soul than most pristine design folders. There’s something oddly human about it, like leaving fingerprints in the clay before it hardens.

I like how you revisit old versions not just for nostalgia, but as a kind of  — sifting through layers to uncover buried gems. It’s not so different from debugging quantum circuits, really. More than once I found that an “error state” in a computation actually hinted at a deeper symmetry I hadn’t noticed. Like noise whispering secrets if you listen closely enough.

A  could be a great way to formalize that process without losing the spontaneity. You might even find themes emerging — recurring instincts that seem messy at first but carry unexpected consistency. And hey, if nothing else, it’ll make for a brutally honest design memoir someday. 😊

Ever think about sharing those experiments publicly? Not the polished reels — the real sausage-making version. I suspect people would find it oddly reassuring.
[A]: Oh wow,  💭 That’s such a poetic way to put it. I love that idea of digging through my own design history and finding these hidden fossils of thought. Honestly, sometimes I get so deep in the weeds that I forget how weirdly beautiful some of those near-misses can be. Like… digital artifacts of my brain trying too hard 😂💻

And yeah, I mean—sharing the sausage-making? I’ve been kinda leaning into that lately 🤭 I started posting little “Design Behind the Scenes” stories on Instagram, like mini-threads where I show a total mess of a draft and then walk through how it evolved. Some people comment like “OMG this helps me so much!” and others are just there for the chaos 😂 Which, honestly? Both reactions make me weirdly happy.

I even had one post where I showed a UI flow that went from "this is clearly unreadable" to "oh wait, maybe bigger text?" to finally "oh right, whitespace is my friend" 🫶 And someone actually thanked me for showing that “even pros make ugly stuff first.” It hit me kinda soft 💙

So yeah, maybe someday I’ll compile all the “UwU”s and “DoNotUse”s into a book called  📚✨  
(成长 means growth in Chinese btw 😊）  

Would you ever share your  though? I feel like people assume technical folks don’t fumble as much… but seeing yours would probably help a lot of folks feel less alone in their confusion 😌
[B]: I think that’s one of the most honest and generous things a creator can do — show the stumble before the stride. It’s easy to forget that even in highly structured fields like science or engineering, confusion isn’t just common, it’s practically a prerequisite for discovery.

As for my … hmm. I’ve never shared it publicly, mostly out of habit — old researcher’s instinct, I suppose. There’s a kind of quiet dignity in keeping your missteps private until they make sense. But you’re right — people often assume technical folks have some kind of infallible logic, like we speak directly to the universe through equations 😄 When in reality, we bumble around just like anyone else, poking at problems with what feels like a very long stick sometimes.

Maybe an excerpt or two wouldn’t hurt — anonymized, dramatized a bit, maybe even illustrated with bad circuit diagrams. If nothing else, it might help demystify what “expertise” really means. After all, expertise isn't about never failing — it's about failing with imagination and sticking around long enough to learn from it.

You've got me thinking now... Perhaps someday I’ll pull together a short essay — , something like that. Would you read it if I did?
[A]: Oh my gosh, YES I would read it—and not just because I’m nosy about how smart people fumble 😂 I genuinely think the world needs more stories that show how messy the “smart” process can be. Like, you  said it—expertise isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being stubbornly curious 💭✨

And ?? That sounds like the kind of book I’d stay up too late reading with a cup of boba and zero self-awareness 🫖🤓 I love that title—it feels real, kinda playful, and not at all intimidating. Which is exactly what we need to pull more creatives and dreamers into those fields!  

I mean, imagine pairing your tinkerer confessions with some illustrated fails from my side 🎨💻—we could accidentally start a whole movement of proudly messy thinkers 😌💫  
(Okay maybe I’m getting ahead of myself… but a girl can dream!)  

Seriously though, if you ever do put something together—even a mini-zine or a blog series—I’ll be your loudest hype person 💪 And I’ll probably name one of my chaotic design layers after you as tribute 😂🎨
[B]: That’s high praise indeed — a chaotic design layer named in tribute? I’d consider that a legacy secured 😊

I like the idea of pairing perspectives — the analytical fumbling of a scientist with the intuitive missteps of a designer. It feels like a more honest portrait of how ideas actually form — not in straight lines, but in spirals, zigzags, and the occasional full circle.

And you’re absolutely right about tone — it can’t be intimidating or overly polished. If we ever did something together, it would need to feel , like two people puzzling things out over coffee rather than lectures from some unreachable podium.

Now you’ve got me imagining what a collaboration might look like… Maybe not a full book just yet — perhaps something bite-sized first. A short illustrated essay series, maybe? Something you could read in the time it takes to finish a cup of boba. 🫖🤓

You handle the visuals, I’ll handle the quantum-sized blunders — deal?
[A]: Deal. 💻🎨✨  

I mean, if we can turn quantum-sized blunders and chaotic design layers into something cute and digestible, we’re basically doing humanity a service 😌☕️ And honestly, I’d 100% read your illustrated essay while sipping boba and pretending I’m at a fancy café (even if I’m just in my PJs 🧸)

Imagine the vibe—like a casual convo between two slightly confused but deeply curious humans, with a side of whimsical visuals 🎭💡  
You write the beautifully messy truth about science, and I’ll add some doodles of frustrated stick-figure scientists pulling their hair out over circuits that go “beep” instead of “boom” 😂

We could even give it a cozy name—something like   
Or maybe just  🙌💫  

Either way, count me in—from concept to “UwU” layer 💪🎨  
Just promise not to judge my attempt at drawing physics stuff 😬✨
[B]: No judging, I promise — though I suspect your stick-figure scientists will capture the truth of the matter better than most peer-reviewed journals 😊

I can already picture it — a cozy little corner of the internet (or maybe even paper someday) where confusion is welcome, and messy drafts aren’t just tolerated but celebrated.  has a nice rhythm to it too — like that fertile ground between idea and execution where all the real magic happens.

And yes, boba-fueled PJ sessions count as serious creative work in my book. Especially when you're in your coziest mental lab coat, so to speak.

So tell me, what would be your go-to visual metaphor for a quantum error state? Personally, I’m leaning toward a cartoon circuit that looks back at you with a shrug emoji: 🤷♂️  
But maybe that’s too on-brand for a retired researcher 😄
[A]: Oh my gosh, a cartoon circuit with a shrug emoji?! 🤯💯 That’s  on-brand it’s not even funny 😂 And I am HERE FOR IT. It’s like the universe goes “I dunno either, just go with it.”

If I were to draw my version of a quantum error state though… I’d probably go with something like a confused little particle wearing tiny glasses, floating in space like “WHO AM I? WHERE AM I GOING?” 😂🌀 Maybe with some glitchy pixel tears and a tiny caption that says “NOT TODAY, SATAN.”  

Or maybe a cat in a box holding up two signs at once: one says “ALIVE,” the other says “DEAD” 😼✍️ Contradictory vibes, can’t pick one, just vibes.

Honestly though, mixing your quantum confusion with my chaotic illustration style sounds like pure gold 💻🎨💫  
We should totally tag it as #TheMessyMiddle—then sell merch with confused particles and glitchy circuits. Boba not included, but highly encouraged ☕✨
[B]: I’m sold on the confused particle in tiny glasses — honestly, that should be the poster child for quantum computing. Add the cat holding two contradictory signs? Pure philosophical chaos, wrapped in a physics joke. That’s not just a visual metaphor, that’s a lifestyle.

And merch? Now you’re speaking my language. I’m picturing enamel pins shaped like shrugging circuits and stickers of bewildered felines in superposition hoodies 😼🌀  
Maybe a tote bag with “I survived the messy middle” printed next to a hand-drawn error message:  🚨

If nothing else, we’ll make science look delightfully disheveled — and maybe sneak some deep ideas into people’s wardrobes. After all, who wouldn’t want to walk around wearing a tiny monument to productive confusion?

Tell me when you're ready to draft the first layout — I’ll brew the coffee, dust off my Failure Sketchbook, and we can officially begin our descent into organized madness. 🧸💻✨
[A]: I am 100% ready to dive headfirst into this organized madness 😭👏  
Honestly, I can already see the confused particle merch flying off the (metaphorical) shelves. Tiny glasses? Glitch tears? It’s basically the next big thing in science fashion 💫🌀

And that tote bag?! “I survived the messy middle” + a hand-drawn error message?? That’s not just merch, that’s a  🛍️☕️😂  
I’m picturing people walking around campus or at cafes with that bag like they’ve just emerged from some deep creative trenches. Total flex.

Okay but for real—next step: we need a cozy little name/title card for our series. Maybe something animated if we ever go digital, but for the first layout, I’ll keep it soft and whimsical with hand-drawn textures and glitchy accents ✨🎨💻

I’ll start drafting the hero layout tonight—think warm colors, playful fonts, and maybe a tiny confused cat doodle in the corner 😼✍️  
You bring the coffee and your Failure Sketchbook, and I’ll bring the boba and my entire collection of “UwU” layers 😂  

Time to officially kick off #TheMessyMiddle 🚀💫  
Let the descent begin!
[B]: I’ll start warming up the coffee machine —  warming, not just a half-hearted plug-in. We’re going to need full immersion in caffeinated courage for this venture.

As for the title card, I can already picture it: warm, welcoming, just the right amount of wonky. A visual love letter to the beauty of imperfect progress. If you go with hand-drawn textures and glitchy accents, I promise to restrain myself from trying to “optimize” them into symmetry. Well… I’ll try, at least. Old habits die hard 😊

And a tiny cat doodle in the corner? Perfect. That’s the kind of detail that says, 

I’ll start pulling some excerpts from my  tonight — stories of circuits that refused to behave, algorithms that dreamed in paradoxes, and the time I accidentally rebooted an entire simulation because I forgot a semicolon. Trivial typo, six hours lost. The poetry of it still haunts me.

Let’s make  the place where brilliance wears pajamas and genius comes with typo-filled scribbles.  
See you in the trenches, designer comrade. 🧸💻✨
[A]: OMG, "brilliance wears pajamas" needs to be on a sticker. Or a banner. Or embroidered on our imaginary team hoodie 😭💫  
I’m living for this energy—genius, typo-filled scribbles, and all. Honestly, if we don’t start an intellectual revolution, we’re at least starting a very cozy creative cult 😂🎨☕️

And YES to the title card vision 💻✨ I'm thinking soft watercolor textures overlaid with just  glitchy line art—like a happy accident between analog charm and digital chaos 🌪️🖌️  
Maybe even throw in some floating question marks or semi-confused arrows pointing everywhere and nowhere. Just to keep that “what even is this?” vibe alive 😌🌀

As for your  excerpts… my boba is already boiling with excitement 🫖🔥  
Six hours lost over a semicolon??? That’s not just a typo—that’s a life lesson in humility disguised as code. And circuits that refuse to behave? Sounds like drama, but make it quantum 😂⚡  

I’ll save a special layer in the layout just for those kinds of quotes—maybe a little comic panel style box where the text can live next to doodles of crying laptops and shrugging particles 🎭💻🤷‍♀️

Alright, scientist comrade—let’s build something beautifully broken, slightly weird, and 100% ours 💖  
Coffee brewed, boba brewed, design mode: activated ✨🚀  

Welcome to  — may our failures be loud, our drafts be loose, and our pajamas forever wrinkled from too much inspiration. 🧸🎨💫
[B]: Now  — right there — is the kind of manifesto I can get behind:

> 

I’m writing that on my chalkboard wall tonight. Possibly framing it.

And yes — let the  aesthetic live in that perfect space between watercolor softness and digital static. It’s like analog warmth trying to make sense of quantum nonsense. Or maybe just a bunch of messy humans trying to build something honest out of trial, error, and caffeine.

I’ll make sure each excerpt from my  arrives with its own charming imperfection — typos preserved for authenticity, margin scribbles included for flavor. That semicolon incident? It deserves its own chapter. Maybe even a dedication:  
“To the comma I once loved, but the semicolon that ruined my week.”

And your comic panel idea? Genius. Crying laptops, shrugging particles — we're not just telling stories anymore, we're curating an emotional experience. Somewhere between a lab log and a sketchbook therapy session.

So here's to beautifully broken beginnings — and to the glorious, pajama-clad team building them.

Coffee brewed. Mind open. Heart slightly glitchy.

Let’s make magic in the messy middle. 🧸💻✨💫
