[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must say, there are so many places that spark my interest. Have you ever been to Kyoto? The thought of walking through those serene bamboo forests and visiting ancient temples simply takes my breath away. I find myself recommending it to guests quite often, though I’ve yet to go myself – funny, isn’t it? There’s always someplace new to discover, don’t you think? What about you – is there any destination that calls to you?
[A]: Ah, Kyoto – an excellent choice. Or should I say, an  suggestion? It’s funny you mention recommending it yet not having visited. I suppose that's the beauty of travel – there's always something just around the corner waiting to surprise us. I’ve always been drawn to less-touristy places myself, like Estonia's Haanja Highlands. Quiet, remote, and full of folklore – perfect for someone who enjoys thinking in solitude while surrounded by nature.

And yes, I do agree: there's always someplace new. Though I wonder, have you ever considered how similar this is to exploring code or philosophy? You venture into unknown territory, sometimes with a map, sometimes without, and inevitably, you learn something about yourself along the way. 

Tell me – what draws you most to Kyoto? The culture? The history? Or perhaps the aesthetic experience?
[B]: Oh, I do love how you’ve tied travel to something deeper – the idea of self-discovery through exploration. That’s very true, isn’t it? In a way, every journey is both external and internal.  

As for Kyoto, I think it’s the harmony of everything you mentioned—the history, the culture, the quiet elegance of its surroundings. I imagine sitting in a traditional teahouse, watching the rain fall in a Zen garden, or catching the soft glow of lanterns along the Kamo River at dusk. There's a kind of calm beauty in that, don’t you think? It feels like stepping into a different rhythm of time.  

You know, sometimes when guests arrive here, they’re seeking just that—a moment to slow down, to reconnect. And while I can’t take them to Kyoto myself just yet, I love helping them find a little piece of tranquility right here during their stay.  

I must say, Estonia sounds enchanting—almost like stepping into a fairytale with misty forests and whispered legends. Do you feel drawn to places like that because of your love for solitude and reflection?
[A]: Indeed, I’m quite fond of that phrase – . It captures something essential about the places that call to me. There’s a kind of stillness in old places, whether it's a centuries-old teahouse or a forest thick with mist and folklore, that allows one to hear their own thoughts more clearly.

You're quite right about Estonia – it does feel like stepping into a fairytale. The Haanja Highlands aren’t just beautiful; they’re steeped in stories. Villagers there have told me legends about the forest spirits and the ancient practice of soul-bargaining with the wind – all of which makes one wonder how much of our world is shaped by the stories we tell. I suppose that’s why I’m drawn to such places. Solitude, yes – but also the whispers of forgotten ideas.  

And speaking of rhythm – I’ve always been fascinated by how different cultures measure time. In Japan, for instance, there's a poetic awareness of impermanence, , while in Estonia, time feels cyclical, tied to the land and its enduring silence. Do you ever find yourself reflecting on how travel reshapes your sense of time? Or perhaps that’s just my philosophical side sneaking in again.
[B]: You have such a thoughtful way of looking at things—it’s quite refreshing. I do agree, travel has this quiet power to shift how we perceive time, sometimes stretching a single moment into something that feels eternal. I remember one guest who stayed with us for just three nights but kept a journal like she’d been here for months. She said the change in scenery gave her a new lens through which to see herself.

As for , what a beautiful concept—cherishing the fleetingness of things, finding depth in impermanence. It makes me think of how quickly seasons change here, how a garden can bloom and fade within weeks, yet leave such a lasting impression. In a way, isn’t that why people travel? To witness something passing, yet carry its essence with them?

I must say, your mention of Estonia’s cyclical time gives me chills. It reminds me of my grandmother’s garden—she always planted according to the moon phases, swore it made the tomatoes sweeter. Perhaps there’s wisdom in aligning ourselves with rhythms older than clocks and calendars.  

Your philosophical side is most welcome, by the way—I rather enjoy it. Do you find that certain places invite deeper reflection more than others? Or is it simply a matter of slowing down, wherever you may be?
[A]: Ah, now  is the heart of the matter, isn’t it? Whether it's the ephemeral beauty of cherry blossoms or your grandmother’s moon-phase tomatoes—there’s something profoundly human in our desire to find meaning in transience. And yes, I do believe some places seem almost  for reflection, as if the air itself carries the weight of centuries and invites you to think more deeply.

Take a place like Estonia’s sacred oak groves or even an old monastery tucked away in the Kyoto mountains—these aren’t just scenic spots. They’re spaces where silence has been cultivated, where time stretches and folds in ways that modern cities rarely allow. In such places, one doesn’t need to  to reflect; it simply happens, like breathing in thinner, purer air.

And yet—I also believe reflection is less about location and more about . You're right: sometimes all it takes is slowing down, really  the way light falls across a teacup or how the wind moves through bamboo. Travel helps with that, doesn’t it? Because everything is unfamiliar, we pay attention again. We become beginners. And there’s wisdom in being a beginner.

I suppose what I’m saying is this: whether we wander far or stay close, the real journey is inward. But oh, the scenery along the way does help, doesn’t it?
[B]: It’s true—some places just seem to  silence in a way that invites you to listen, not just with your ears, but with your whole being. I think that's one of the reasons people come to stay at the hotel—they don’t always know what they’re seeking, but they find it in the stillness between the morning birdsong and the evening tide.

You mentioned being a beginner again, and it made me think of how often I see guests arrive tense and distracted, only to leave with a kind of quiet wonder in their eyes. It’s as if being somewhere unfamiliar gives them permission to be curious again—to ask questions instead of rushing to answers. In a way, isn’t that what reflection really is? Letting yourself remain open, even when you don’t have all the pieces?

I love that idea—that real travel is an inward path dressed in foreign scenery. And yes, that scenery helps. I mean, I’ve never met someone who walked through a grove of ancient oaks and didn’t come out changed in some small way. There’s something about standing beneath trees that have seen more centuries than we can fathom—it humbles you, doesn’t it?

Now I’m longing for my own little journey. Perhaps it’s time I took a weekend for myself—somewhere quiet, where I can listen to the wind and remember how to wonder. Any recommendations for a beginner?
[A]: Ah, now , my friend, is the most important journey of all—the one where you set out not to escape, but to meet yourself somewhere new. And I must say, you're already asking the right questions.

For a beginner in search of quiet wonder, I’d recommend something modest yet profound: a place where the landscape listens as much as you do. Perhaps somewhere like the Lake District in England—Wordsworth’s old stomping ground. Not for the poetry (though it's there if you want it), but for the stillness between the hills. A simple inn by the water, a pair of well-worn boots, and a few hours of wandering without destination. Sometimes nature’s gentle rhythm is the best guide.

Or, if you're drawn to the sea, maybe the west coast of Ireland? Wind-swept cliffs, stone circles whispering old stories, and pubs where time stretches long over a pint and a fiddle tune. There’s a kind of melancholy beauty there that doesn’t demand anything from you—just your presence.

But really, any place will do, as long as it asks you to slow down. Even a forgotten corner of your own town might surprise you—if you look closely enough.

Tell me, do you prefer mountains, forests, or the sea? I suspect the answer will reveal more than a little about the kind of journey you’re ready for.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—meeting oneself somewhere new. I think you're right; the best journeys aren't about ticking off landmarks but finding those quiet moments that settle into your heart.

Now, you’ve asked the perfect question— Well… if I had to choose just one, I suppose my heart leans toward the sea. There's something endlessly soothing about its rhythm—the way it never stays still yet feels so constant. I could sit on a rocky shore for hours, listening to the waves and watching gulls trace circles in the sky. It clears my mind in a way little else does.

Though I must say, I adore the idea of an old forest too—those deep, green hushes where time feels like it holds its breath. Perhaps I’m not ready to pick just one after all. Maybe the journey needs to include a bit of everything?

Ireland sounds absolutely dreamy—wind, cliffs, stories carved into stone. And melancholy beauty? Well, that does seem to ask for nothing more than your presence, doesn’t it? Very tempting indeed.

But now I'm curious—have  ever found yourself returning to a particular place again and again, as if drawn by something unseen? Or do you always chase the next unknown?
[A]: Ah, now  is a question that deserves a quiet evening and perhaps another cup of tea.

To answer honestly—yes, there are places I return to, like old books whose pages hold more meaning each time you read them. One such place is a small coastal village in Cornwall, where the Atlantic meets cliffs that have stood their ground for millennia. I find myself drawn back not because I expect it to change, but because  do. Each visit reveals something new—not in the landscape, but in how I see it. A rock formation I’ve passed a dozen times suddenly makes sense. A path I once found daunting now feels familiar. It’s a quiet kind of wisdom, really—one that only emerges when you let a place get under your skin.

There's also a certain monastery in the north of Japan, tucked into the mountains near Yamagata, where monks still practice in silence broken only by the sound of wind through cedar trees. I’ve been there twice, and both times I left with more questions than answers—which, in my book, is the best kind of departure.

So no, I don’t always chase the next unknown. Sometimes, the deepest discoveries come from going back, not forward. Returning allows you to see how far you've come. And isn’t that what reflection truly is?

Tell me—does the idea of returning to a place speak to you, or does the magic lie more in the novelty of the first arrival?
[B]: There’s something quite beautiful about that—returning to a place and finding  changed, even when the landscape remains the same. It’s like meeting an old friend and realizing how much you’ve both grown. I think I’d love that feeling, of being known by a place without it ever saying a word.

At the moment, I think I’m still in the phase of wanting to see everything for the first time—drinking in the novelty, letting each new place surprise me. But I can imagine a time when I’ll long to go back, to sit with a place again and see what’s shifted within me. Perhaps I’ll return to Cornwall with you one day—though I suspect I’ll need my own pair of well-worn boots before then.

It’s funny you mentioned the monastery in Japan. A guest once told me about staying there, describing the silence as “thicker than fog.” He said it took two days just to stop noticing it, and another two to finally rest inside it. I’ve never forgotten that. I wonder—when you left with more questions than answers, did they feel like heavy ones? Or was it a lightness, knowing some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved?
[A]: Ah, now  is a fine way to put it—“the silence being thicker than fog.” I may have to borrow that phrase one day; it captures the essence of that place perfectly.

To answer your question—no, the questions I carried away weren’t heavy at all. If anything, they were liberating. They hovered like mist in the mind, not as burdens, but as invitations. You learn to live with uncertainty differently after an experience like that. Not as something to resolve, but as something to  in, much like that silence. It teaches you how to breathe more deeply—not just with your lungs, but with your thoughts.

There’s a kind of lightness that comes from realizing some doors aren’t meant to be opened fully. Just glimpsed through a crack, perhaps. And sometimes, that glimpse is enough. Maybe even more than enough.

As for your own journey—yes, drink in the novelty while you can. Let each place astonish you. There will be time later to return, to sit with what remains when the wonder settles into something quieter. And yes, should you ever find yourself in Cornwall with a pair of trusty boots and a restless curiosity, I’d be delighted to point you toward the best cliffside teahouse I know.

Until then—may your paths be winding, and your questions always worth pondering.
[B]: What a lovely thought—that some doors are only meant to be glimpsed through, not opened. I think I shall carry that with me, like a small lantern in my pocket for those moments when certainty feels elusive.

And I must say, your description of that lightness—the kind that comes from dwelling in uncertainty—resonates deeply. It reminds me of how I feel after reading a particularly moving passage in a novel. You close the book, and there’s this quiet hum inside you, as if something has shifted, though you can’t quite name it. Perhaps that’s what the best journeys do—they leave us changed in ways we don’t immediately understand.

I do hope one day our paths lead us both to Cornwall. Until then, I’ll keep recommending Kyoto with a hopeful heart, and perhaps one day, I’ll finally step onto those moss-covered temple paths myself.

And thank you—for reminding me that travel is more than movement. It’s also stillness, reflection, and the gentle unfolding of questions that lead us deeper, not outward.

Until our next conversation—and yes, I rather hope there will be one—I wish you many winding roads and quiet places where the wind carries stories.
[A]: Ah, now  is a farewell worth savoring—not an ending, but a quiet turning of the page.

You’re very welcome. And I must say, you have a rare gift—of seeing not just  things, but  them. That quiet hum you speak of—the one that lingers after a good book or a meaningful journey—is precisely the sort of thing I live for. It’s in those spaces, between knowing and wondering, that life feels most alive.

Yes, let’s hope our paths do cross in Cornwall—or perhaps even somewhere quieter, like a forgotten village tucked into the Estonian woods. There’s no rush. Some conversations, like some journeys, are best when they unfold slowly, like ripples on a pond rather than rushing rivers.

And by all means—keep recommending Kyoto. Sometimes the act of hoping for a place is as nourishing as standing within it. Who knows? Perhaps the day will come when you step into that moss-covered temple path, and something inside you will quietly say, 

Until then—and yes, I do hope there’s a next time—I’ll be out there somewhere, asking questions no one rushes to answer, and finding joy in the gentle unfolding of things.

Safe travels, my friend. May your roads be winding, your silences deep, and your lantern always glow when you need it most.
[B]: Ah, what a truly graceful turn of phrase—. I couldn’t have said it better myself. And yes, I do believe some conversations are like books you don’t want to finish, because you know the last page holds more than just words—it holds a moment you’ll carry forward.

You’ve described it perfectly—the space between knowing and wondering, where life feels most alive. I think that’s the place I want to live in, even when the world insists on rushing past. A place where a lantern’s glow can be enough, and where a ripple on a pond says more than a wave.

I rather like the idea of meeting somewhere unexpected someday—a forgotten Estonian village, or perhaps even a teahouse tucked into the Kyoto hills. There’s no hurry, of course. Some stories unfold best when given time to breathe.

Until then, I’ll keep tending to my little corner of the world here at the hotel, helping guests find their own quiet moments. And who knows? Maybe one day I’ll return from a journey with a new kind of stillness inside me—one shaped by moss-covered stones and cedar-scented silence.

Safe travels to you too, my friend. May your questions always lead you deeper, and may the wind carry stories just for you.
[A]: Ah, now  is a vision worth holding onto—a quiet teahouse in the hills, or perhaps a lantern-lit path through an Estonian forest, where two travelers might one day meet not as strangers, but as fellow seekers of quiet truths.

You're doing important work, tending to that little corner of the world and helping others find their own stillness. In a way, you're giving them something far more precious than rest—you're offering space for reflection, for wonder, for the kind of slow unfolding that only happens when one feels truly seen by a place.

And yes, should you ever return from your journey with a stillness shaped by moss and cedar, I suspect you'll carry it not as a memory, but as a quiet knowing. The kind that doesn't need words to be real.

Until our paths may cross—or until our conversation finds new breath another day—I’ll be somewhere between books and landscapes, asking too many questions and finding comfort in the ones that refuse to be answered.

With warmth and quiet hope—  
Richard
[B]: Ah, now  is a letter I shall keep tucked away in my thoughts—a quiet teahouse in the hills, an Estonian forest path lit by lanterns, and a conversation that began in passing and has grown into something gently luminous.

You are too kind, Richard. I suppose that  the heart of what I try to offer here—not just service, but a space where people feel seen, even if only for a night. It’s a small thing, perhaps, but I do believe those small moments add up to something lasting.

And I must say, your words—about carrying stillness as a quiet knowing rather than a memory—have settled deep. I suspect they’ll return to me on quiet mornings and long walks, when the mind lingers between things.

Until we meet beneath cedar trees or across a teahouse table—or until our conversation finds its next page—I shall be here, tending to both guests and gardens, asking my own questions of the wind, and hoping for rain when the earth grows dry.

With equal warmth and quiet hope—  
Margaret
[A]: Ah, Margaret—what a rare and quiet joy it is to find a conversation that lingers like the scent of rain on stone. You’ve been most generous with your thoughts, your reflections, and yes, your hope. And I, for one, shall carry this exchange like a small ember in my pocket, warming me on those long stretches between kindred minds.

You are not merely tending to guests or gardens—you are cultivating space for stillness in a world that forgets how to pause. That is no small thing. It is, in its own way, an act of grace.

And when next the wind speaks, whether through cedar boughs or coastal pines, may you hear in it not just movement, but meaning. May the rain come gently when needed, and may your questions always lead you toward wonder rather than weariness.

With deepest warmth,  
Richard
[B]: Ah, Richard—what a rare and beautiful thing it is to find a conversation that doesn’t end, but simply rests, like a well-loved book left open on a chair by the window. Your words are a quiet gift, one I shall return to often when the world feels too swift and the days too full.

You are very kind to see what I do in such gentle light. To know that even a fleeting moment of stillness can be a kind of grace—that is something I hope I never forget.

And yes, may the wind speak kindly, and may I remember to listen—not just with my ears, but with that quiet place inside where wonder lives. May your own path be soft beneath your feet and rich with questions worth turning over in your mind like smooth stones found by a riverbank.

Until we meet again, in word or in wandering—

With heartfelt warmth,  
Margaret
