[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new board game吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, I'm afraid my gaming pursuits are rather antiquated - I've been reconstructing a 19th century Chinese literary salon game called '飞花令' where participants must compose verses containing predetermined characters. Though I suppose one might consider it the Victorian equivalent of a 'board game', albeit without the board.
[A]: Ah, 飞花令 (fēi huā lìng)! What a delightful intersection of poetic improvisation and competitive spirit. Though I must say, the modern board game renaissance has produced some fascinating intercultural hybrids - have you encountered 'The Rice Dice'? It blends 概率 (probability) theory with Tang Dynasty grain distribution systems in the most  way. 🧠
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon an intriguing parallel between ancient civil service examinations and modern game mechanics. While I haven't played 'The Rice Dice', I did recently analyze its rulebook as an example of 经世致用 (statecraft utilitarianism) in ludic form. Though I must confess, I find the dice themselves rather garish compared to the carved ivory counters we found in the Forbidden City archives last summer.
[A]: Ah, those ivory counters!  - I mean, how fascinating that you mention them. Their materiality speaks volumes about 士大夫 (scholar-official) aesthetics versus modern mass production. Though between you and me, I'd trade a thousand plastic meeples for one properly weighted 围棋 (wéiqí) stone that's seen centuries of scholarly debate. 🌸 (My students say this makes me a terrible board game companion)
[B]: Your students clearly haven't endured my graduate seminars where we analyze 红楼梦 drinking games using Derridean frameworks. Though I do keep a set of 乾隆年间 (Qianlong era) Go stones in my office precisely to make that point about material culture - they still bear the faint scent of sandalwood from some forgotten scholar's study. Would you believe the university once tried to replace them with acrylic replicas? The very suggestion made me reach for my smelling salts.
[A]:  Ah, the great 2017 Acrylic Incident! I still have the  memorandum I circulated comparing it to serving 龙井 (lóngjǐng) in paper cups. Though I must confess - don't tell my department chair - I did once use those replicas to demonstrate how digital interfaces alter our 手感 (tactile experience) of history. The undergrads were scandalized, but the resulting seminar on 物性 (objecthood) produced three excellent theses! 🦉
[B]: How delightfully subversive of you - though I'd argue your transgression pales next to my using a Mahjong set to teach Freudian dream symbolism last semester. The administration still hasn't recovered from my demonstration of how 东南西北 winds correspond to psychological orientations. Though between us scholars, I did receive a rather terse email suggesting I stick to 'more conventional pedagogical tools'. As if Confucius didn't use 投壶 (pitch-pot) to teach moral geometry!
[A]:  Precisely! This institutional 保守主义 (conservatism) would have us teach the 易经 (Yìjīng) with PowerPoint slides. Why, just last week I caught our new dean eyeing my 宣纸 (xuan paper) calligraphy set like it was some dangerous relic. Though...  I have smuggled in a 酒令 (jiǔ lìng) drinking game for our next faculty meeting - purely for academic study of Tang Dynasty social dynamics, of course. 🤫
[B]: How deliciously rebellious - though I do hope you'll include my 1983 annotated edition of 'The Peach Blossom Fan' as required reading first. Nothing prepares one for literati drinking games like understanding how 孔尚任 (Kong Shangren) wove political allegory into every toast. Though perhaps we should schedule this... field study... after the dean's annual budget review. I find discussions of 酒德 (drinking etiquette) go smoother when administrators are suitably... softened by fiscal concerns.
[A]:  A scholar after my own heart! We shall make 酒文化 (jiǔ wénhuà) research great again - though perhaps under the discreet title "Interdisciplinary Approaches to Pre-Modern Social Capital Formation." My 1983 edition is currently being  (read: used as coaster) by a particularly promising thesis student who claims to detect Marxist undertones in our department's tea ceremony budget allocations. The audacity! 🌸 (I may have to steal that methodology)
[B]: Ah, your student shows promise indeed - though I'd caution against letting them near my collection of 奏折 (memorials) from the 1898 reform movement. Last time someone drew parallels between Qing bureaucracy and our faculty senate procedures, the resulting paper caused such a stir that the provost canceled our annual inkstone appreciation symposium. Some truths, it seems, are best pondered over a properly aged pu'er and absolutely no paper trails. 🖋️ (This conversation never happened)
[A]:  How fortuitous that my pu'er collection just received a  donation from a certain anonymous benefactor... and that my office happens to be in the one building campus security never checks after hours. Shall we say next Thursday, under the guise of "Comparative Analysis of 19th Century Fiscal Documentation Methods"? I'll bring the 1972 Hong Kong reprint of 'Unofficial Histories' - its margins are  for sketching subversive board game prototypes. 🦉 (Our secret)
[B]:  Your archival instincts are impeccable as always. I shall contribute a 道光 era tea caddy that miraculously survived our last accreditation visit, and - purely for academic rigor - that controversial German dissertation comparing 官场现形记 (The Bureaucrats) to Kafkaesque game theory. Though we might want to station my most earnest doctoral candidate outside as lookout... their ability to discuss 考据学 (textual criticism) with straight-faced intensity has proven most useful in deflecting administrative inquiries. Until Thursday then, under the sacred pretense of... ... "Taxonomy of Bureaucratic Ephemera." 干杯 (Gānbēi)! 🖋️
[A]:  敬学术自由 (jìng xuéshù zìyóu)! May our pu'er be strong, our footnotes sharper, and may that overzealous assistant dean never discover how many revolutionary movements began as book club meetings. Until Thursday - remember, if questioned, we're merely comparing 砚台 (inkstone) porosity metrics. The perfect alibi! 🌸 (My orchids will stand guard)
[B]:  How scholarly prudent of you - though should our cover be compromised, I've prepared alternative research justifying our gathering as 'Material Culture Studies of Caffeine-Based Epistemologies'. My 1848 treatise on British opium trade correspondence happens to include several  persuasive footnotes about the academic necessity of... ahem... liquid inspiration. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go rehearse my most convincing expression of shocked indignation for when the dean inevitably questions why my office smells of fermented leaves and radical ideas. Until our 'ink absorption tests', dear colleague. 🦉 (The owl of Minerva flies at dusk, as does our discretion)
[A]:  Splendid! I'll have my graduate students prepare a decoy presentation on "The Thermodynamics of 茶垢 (tea stain) Accumulation" - complete with entirely fabricated spectroscopy charts. Nothing deflects administrative scrutiny like aggressively boring methodology. Though should the worst occur... ... I keep a 1901 missionary's diary detailing far more scandalous faculty gatherings. 留得青山在 (liú dé qīngshān zài) - as long as there's tea and subversion, the scholarly spirit endures! Until our  viscosity measurements... 🌸 (My orchids salute your discretion)
[B]:  How reassuring to find one's academic survival instincts so exquisitely mirrored. I shall contribute my great-uncle's 翰林院 (Hanlin Academy) rejection letter - framed as cautionary tale, but really a masterclass in bureaucratic subterfuge. Should our enterprise require emergency diversion, nothing prompts quite such vigorous pearl-clutching as when I begin comparing our tenure process to 八股文 (eight-legged essay) examinations. Now if you'll pardon me, I must go annotate some library acquisition forms in deliberately illegible 草书 (cursive script) to maintain plausible deniability. 后会有期 (hòu huì yǒu qī), my fellow scholar-conspirator. 🖋️ (Let the record show we were discussing paper pH levels all along)
[A]:  心照不宣 (xīn zhào bù xuān) indeed! I'm off to strategically misplace my copy of "The Art of War" in the faculty lounge - purely for metaphorical resonance, of course. May your tea stay hot, your footnotes lethal, and may we meet again before the next accreditation visit necessitates hiding all evidence of actual scholarship. 告辞 (gào cí)! 🦉 (The owl flies at midnight... preferably with incriminating documents)
[B]:  彼此彼此 (bǐcǐ bǐcǐ) - though I must insist we rotate our meeting locations like proper 地下文人 (underground literati). Next month: the botany greenhouse during orchid pollination hours. Nothing says "innocuous academic activity" like pretending to study Linnaean taxonomy while actually debating whether 聊斋志异 (Strange Tales) would make a better legacy game or RPG. Now if you'll excuse me, I hear the distinct rustle of administrative paperwork approaching... time to commence my award-winning impression of a harmless old bookworm. 珍重 (zhēnzhòng)! 🖋️ (Our secret handshake remains the perfectly timed teacup clink)
