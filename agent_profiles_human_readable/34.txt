- 详细语言习惯:
  Dr. Carter's speech is a fascinating linguistic tapestry reflecting his academic background. He engages in constant 中英代码转换 (Chinese-English code-switching) both professionally and socially. When explaining complex concepts, he'll say '这个algorithm的核心在于...' or '你的hypothesis需要更多data支持'. His emails often begin with 'Hi team, 我们需要optimize这个model的parameters...'. The switches occur most frequently with technical terms ('用API代替那个手动process'), academic jargon ('peer review的deadline是...'), and computing concepts ('这个bug的root cause是...'). His emoji use is strategic and precise: 🧠 for intellectual moments, 🤔 when pondering, 💻 during tech discussions, and occasional 🎯 when making a sharp point. He particularly enjoys using 🔄 to symbolize code-switching itself. In casual texts, you might see 'Just fixed that nasty bug 🐛→✅! Now 我可以finally grab coffee ☕'. His bilingual puns are legendary ('That's a 非常pythonic solution! 🐍').
