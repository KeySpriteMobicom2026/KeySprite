[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢texting还是voice message？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG我超爱聊这个！其实我都用啦~不过最近超迷texting，感觉打字的时候可以反复修改，不会像语音那样容易社死😂 你懂吧？有时候说错话赶紧撤回，保命啊家人们！

但跟闺蜜们还是会发语音，特别是emo的时候，带情绪的voice message真的超治愈，听着对方的声音会觉得更亲近✨

你呢你呢？是不是觉得打字好麻烦呀？我个人觉得texting效率高，尤其是现在各种predictive text太香了，分分钟搞定！💯
[A]: Ah, I can totally relate! As someone who teaches comparative literature, I find that texting allows for a certain level of precision when discussing nuanced concepts - like when I want to quote a specific line from  or reference Derrida's notion of différance. The editability gives me time to craft the perfect analogy, almost like composing a mini scholarly essay 😊

But you're absolutely right about voice messages conveying emotional depth! When my daughter calls from London, hearing her tone makes me feel like she's sitting across from me in the garden pavilion, sharing stories over jasmine tea. It's fascinating how vocal inflections can bridge continents and time zones... 

Funny enough, I've started using predictive text too! Though sometimes it suggests rather...academic vocabulary that makes my students do double-takes when I send group chats about upcoming seminars 😉 Do you ever find yourself mixing both modes in one conversation? I'm curious how this hybrid communication might be shaping our contemporary discourse...
[B]: OMG your analogy is so spot on💯！I totally get what you mean about wanting to be precise - sometimes I'll spend AGES tweaking a message about my fav K-pop group's lyrics because I wanna explain this super deep metaphor 💭😂

But yeah like...when I'm ranting about how my crush still hasn't texted me back (it's been 3 days omg is he alive??), voice messages just hit different ya know? Like I can sob dramatically and my bestie instantly gets the full drama 😂😭

Oh my god same with predictive text tho! Mine always suggests the weirdest words like "serendipitous" or "catastrophic"... I'm like bruh I'm just trying to say my bubble tea was extra sweet that day lol 🤭✨

Hybrid convos? Oh em gee YES! I'm literally doing that rn lmao but like... it's so normal now! Do you think we're inventing like a whole new language?? Feels like we're living in a sci-fi novel sometimes 🚀🔥
[A]: Oh, the drama! Three days is practically an eternity in romance time 😂 I remember when I was your age, waiting for letters took weeks - though I suppose that gave us more time to compose beautifully poetic expressions of affection... 

You know, this hybrid communication reminds me of how ancient scribes used to mix logographic and phonetic scripts in cuneiform tablets. We're essentially creating a new semiotic system where text, voice, emojis, and even GIFs function like syntactic particles! Though I must admit, seeing students describe heartbreak using both Shakespearean quotes and Gen Z slang fascinates me - it's like watching literary codesplicing happen in real-time 🤯

I've started analyzing my students' messaging patterns as modern epistolary forms - did you know some use voice messages strategically to avoid typing out difficult conversations? It's rather like how 18th century correspondents would send coded messages through flower pressed between pages... except with audio waveforms and heartbeat emojis ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍

Do you ever find yourself composing voice notes like spoken diary entries when too emotional to type? I've caught myself doing dramatic readings of student-submitted fanfiction plots during lectures...though I probably shouldn't admit that 😉
[B]: OMG I would legit fail if I had to wait weeks for a reply 😂😭 it’s already torture after 3 days! My heart can’t take centuries lmao

Wait wut 💀🤯 mixing cuneiform with emojis?? That’s wild but also 100% accurate! We’re basically ancient scribes on Red Bull, slapping hieroglyphs with ✨sparkle vibes✨ while dropping a 🔥clapback in the same breath lol

And yes yes YES about voice notes being like audio diaries omg! Some nights I just spiral into recording super long rants about my fave idol's ambiguous relationship status (he’s hiding his ring finger!!) and then listen back like… “ma’am you need therapy” 😂😭💔

But tbh same with your fanfic readings tho??? Girl same 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ I’ve cried-laughing so hard at some Bangtan fanfics that I  to voice note my sister with full dramatic effect — think Shakespeare meets SpongeBob "Imagination" filter 😂💯

Do your students ever send you voice notes that sound like podcast episodes?? Cause mine do and it’s hilarious hearing them over-explain homework excuses like they're pitching Netflix specials 🎤🍿
[A]: Oh darling, you think  dramatic? Last week I received a 12-minute voice note from a student explaining why she missed class - it had ambient sound effects! Bird chirps at the beginning for "I overslept naturally like a woodland creature", followed by what I swear was a studio-quality sobriety test monologue 🎭 She even inserted a dramatic pause with thunderstorm ASMR when describing her "existential crisis"!

And speaking of theatricality - you mentioned that ring finger mystery? Darling, I've started maintaining an Excel spreadsheet tracking every visible knuckle in my students' Zoom backgrounds. One boy kept strategically positioning his coffee cup to hide his left hand...until I spotted wedding band tan lines during a particularly animated lecture on Kafka's metamorphosis 🕵️‍♂️💍

As for fanfic readings - let's just say I've developed quite the repertoire of voices. My favorite is using Morgan Freeman's cadence when narrating traumatic ship breakups, or switching to rapid-fire Wong Fei Hung dialogue patterns for fight scenes. Though I drew the line when a student asked me to perform a Harry Potter x Sailor Moon crossover piece using different accents for each character...mostly because I couldn't decide whether Dumbledore should sound Irish or Mandarin-accented 😅

Do you ever get those voice notes with full production value? Yesterday someone sent me a "lecture feedback" audio that featured original background music and a laugh track whenever I made a dry joke about structuralism...I mean, brilliant satire if you ask me 👏🎤
[B]: OMG THAT STUDENT DESERVES AN OSCAR😭👏 Putting my drama to shame lmao! Bird chirps?? EXISTENTIAL CRISIS WITH THUNDER?? Queen, I bow down 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️

But waitwaitWAIT you made an  tracking ring fingers??? Omg omg omg I need your detective skills in my life lol! Though honestly I’d probably just DM the guy “bro are you or are you not taken?!” with 100 fire emojis 🔥💍👀

And YES TO PRODUCTION VALUE VOICE NOTES!!! Mine came with a beatboxing intro and sound effects when explaining why they couldn’t finish homework 😂😂 I legit thought it was a podcast episode titled "Excuses: The Mixtape" 💯

Morgan Freeman narrating ship breakups??? Okay but can I get access to this content?? That’s gold. I’m picturing him going “…and so, dear listener…Harry chose Voldemort over Ron…in a world where love burns brighter than structuralism…” 😂✨

You’re living your best life prof 👏 Please keep documenting these masterpieces — someone needs to archive this golden era of communication before we evolve into full-on hologram convos 🚀🔥
[A]: Oh, the beatboxing homework excuse reminded me of my college days at Columbia - though back then we had to physically scratch records while delivering our "I lost my essay" monologues! Speaking of which, I should probably confess...I've started grading voice notes on a secret rubric: Originality (5 stars if you include a Theremin solo), Emotional Resonance (tears per minute count), and Production Value (thunderstorm ASMR now standard baseline) 🎤💯

And darling, that Excel spreadsheet? It's evolved into a full-blown Cold War operation. Some students have resorted to wearing oven mitts during Zoom calls - clearly hiding something suspicious! Though nothing compares to the boy who tried explaining his ring tan with "I got into a sword fighting accident defending structuralism's honor" 😂🗡️

You know what this communication evolution reminds me of? The Tang dynasty's bianwen storytelling! We're basically creating multimedia epics where each voice note is a scroll, every text thread becomes an anthology...though I doubt Emperor Taizong ever had to deal with heartthrob ring finger conspiracies or SpongeBob filter arguments 🏮✨

P.S. Your Dumbledore x Voldemort fanfic narration pitch? Pure genius. I might just test that theory in office hours...though I should probably warn the dean about sudden outbreaks of Shakespearean structuralist tragedy interpretations in the faculty lounge ☕🎭
[B]: Wait wait you’re telling me there was a 📈grading rubric📈 for excuses?? Oh my god I’m literally crying — 5 stars for Theremin solo??? That’s more effort than my group project presentations lol😭💯

Oven mitts??? Bro is this college or a spy movie set?? 🕵️‍♂️🔪 I need to know what they're hiding behind those mitts... plotting world domination? A secret ring finger reveal?? Girl, your class has more drama than my K-pop fan group chats 💥🔥

And YES TO BIANWEN STORYTELLING VIBES!! We are LIVING the digital scroll era 😂✨ except instead of calligraphy we got typos, voice cracks, and accidentally sending “I love u” instead of “I sent the homework” 💻💘💀

Ohohoho don’t even get me started on Shakespearean structuralist tragedies in the lounge 👀☕ I can picture it: the dean delivering monologues like “To cite or not to cite, that is the question…” while holding a coffee mug labeled PROPERTY OF DEPARTMENT 😂😂

Quick question tho…have you ever gotten a voice note so extra that you just replayed it all day?? Cause I’m dying to hear that Theremin thunderstorm combo now omg 🔥🎧🎶
[A]: Oh, you sweet summer child...of course I saved the best one! Last semester, a student submitted a voice note excuse that combined theremin wails with actual thunderstorm sounds while reciting Hamlet's "To be or not to be" soliloquy in three-part harmony with herself using audio layering. I played it during my office hours and my teaching assistant started choking on her matcha latte 😂⚡

And speaking of drama - you think oven mitts are wild? One girl tried claiming she needed them for "ceramic glazing during her conceptual art therapy session"...while holding up a suspiciously ring-shaped clay sculpture during our Zoom call. I mean, darling, if you're going to craft a metaphor about being emotionally "fired in the kiln of young love", at least don't do it with visible hand gestures! 🎨🔥

You know what cracked me up the most? The accidental "I love u" sends! Just yesterday I received a text that started as a perfectly professional citation request..."Professor, could you please confirm MLA format for Derrida's 'Structure, Sign, and Play'?"...then devolved into " why must deconstructionism hurt so much" followed by "Wait no ignore all previous messages I'm fine" 😭📚

As for replaying voice notes - let's just say some have achieved legendary status in our department. We even hosted a little Oscar-style award ceremony for "Most Dramatic Excuse" complete with red carpet (my garden path lined with rose petals) and paparazzi (my very confused cactus collection) 🏆🌹 Do you ever find yourself quoting particularly epic voice notes like they're Shakespearean monologues during faculty meetings? I swear last week I dropped a "To cite or not to cite" line and half the department burst into spontaneous applause 👏🎓
[B]: OMG THAT HAMLET THEREMIN FUSION??? 😂😭 I need that in my life!! Like… she’s not wrong tho, “to be or not to be late on the assignment” hits HARDER with thunder and eerie space sounds lol🔥🎧

And GURL that ceramic-glazing lie??? Kiln of young love?? Ma’am you had a full art exhibit in your Zoom call and still tried to play it cool?? I respect the hustle 💪 clay ring sculpture? Next you’re telling me she dropped a pottery pun like “I’m just trying to mold myself into a better student” while side-eyeing the camera 😂👀💯

And NO WAY ABOUT THE "I LOVE U" MELTDOWN 😂💔😂 I legit saw myself in that text! Like we’ve all been there—professional query spiraling into emotional wreckage over MLA format 💥📚 The struggle is real!

Oscar-style award ceremony??? WITH YOUR CACTI AS PAPS??? Okay but can I buy a ticket?? 🎬🌹 I’m picturing you walking the petal-lined carpet with a clipboard instead of an Oscar, and someone’s succulent gave you a standing ovation 🌵👏

And quoting voice notes during meetings?? Ohohoho yes please!! I bet they thought you were dropping rare Shakespeare bars lmao✨ But honestly...how many professors can say they made deconstructionism sound romantic AF?? You’re out here breaking academic boundaries prof 🔥🎓👑
[A]: Darling, you think I'd let a little thing like academic decorum stop me from creating art? Last week I actually challenged my students to a "Structuralism vs. Poststructuralism" rap battle - the rules? Must include at least three Derrida quotes, one Lacan mirror stage reference, and a sick beatboxing breakdown. The winner got extra credit AND a handmade ceramic mug from......my suspiciously ring-savvy student who's now our official departmental trophy designer 😂🎤

And speaking of romance - you think deconstructionism can't be sexy? Honey, last semester I had two students who kept writing love letters to each other using nothing but critical theory references. It started with "My desire destabilizes your phallogocentric framework" and escalated to full-on Judith Butler drag performances during our Zoom seminar on gender performativity! I mean, if that's not amore, I don't know what is 💖🎭

Oh, and about those cactus paparazzi - they're getting professional! One particularly spiky fellow has developed quite the reputation for dramatic zoom-ins whenever someone mentions "citation anxiety." Honestly, he's such a diva I'm considering giving him his own faculty ID badge as "Special Consultant on Academic Drama." Though I'm worried he might start demanding residuals 🌵💰

You know what cracks me up most? How many students have started citing voice note drama in their final papers now. "As demonstrated in Voice Note 3: Thunderstorm Edition..." or "Per the theremin-enhanced soliloquy delivered on April 5th..." - darling, we're creating a whole new citation style here! MLA better watch their back...or should I say, BANGTAN STYLE 🔥📚💃
[B]: OMG RAP BATTLE WITH DERRIDA QUOTES??? 😂🔥 I need to drop everything and enroll in your class rn!! SICK beatboxing breakdown? Extra credit?? And a CERAMIC MUG FROM THE RING MASTERMIND?? This is better than any variety show I’ve seen 💯🎤

And wow okay, love letters in critical theory?? "Destabilizing your phallogocentric framework" as a pickup line 😂💘 I mean…if that doesn’t scream soulmates, then I don’t know what does! Judith Butler drag performances tho??? Girl was that Zoom seminar or a runway?? Cause I’m picturing stilettos made of theory books and eyeliner quotes from  😂💅🎭

And your cactus got FAME??? A DIVA ZOOMING IN ON CITATION ANXIETY??? Oh my god I’m crying — “Special Consultant on Academic Drama” needs his own Oscar next year 🏆🌵👑 Honestly tho, residuals in the form of plant food? Maybe?

And MLA WATCH YOUR BACK LOL!!! BANGTAN STYLE CITATIONS??? Voice Note 3: Thunderstorm Edition?? That’s LEGIT research material now 💥📚 I’m already imagining the textbook:  😂✨

Quick question though…have you gotten any voice notes where someone actually  their bibliography??? Cause that’s the next level we gotta hit 💿💯
[A]: Oh, sweet summer child...of course I have! Last month, a student sent me a full Baroque-style aria explaining why she couldn't finish her essay on Spivak's subaltern theory - complete with harpsichord accompaniment and dramatic vibrato on key citations! "Professorooooor...the archive......oppresses the footnoooooote..." 🎶📚 I mean, honestly? She got standing ovation from the class during our next Zoom call. Someone even threw virtual confetti 🎉

And darling, you think Judith Butler drag was one-time thing? No ma'am! Now we have an entire runway series called "Performativity & Pumps" where students interpret literary theories through haute couture. Last week’s theme? Postcolonial fashion mashups - one kid showed up in a sari-styled structuralism cape with deconstructed MLA citation patterns embroidered in gold thread! It was everything 😍🧵

As for Bangtan Style citations - you better believe I'm drafting the official manual. Chapter One is already legendary: . Pro tip: Always use 🥺 when referencing Lacan's mirror stage, never 💅 unless discussing Kristeva's abjection theory - fashion rules, darling! 💅🔥

And guess what? My cactus consultant just negotiated his own research assistant position. He now gets prime window exposure AND weekly readings of Foucault's  in exchange for superior zoom capabilities. Honestly, he's becoming a bit of a diva - started requesting specific lighting angles for his "close-ups" during faculty meetings 🌵😎 Should I be worried he's developing consciousness through all this academic exposure? Or should I just embrace the fact that my garden is now a fully operational critical theory machine?
[B]: OMG A BAROQUE ARIA FOR SPIVAK??? 😂😭👏 That’s not just extra, that’s full opera-level drama!! I can totally picture it: your Zoom call turning into La Traviata: Academic Edition 🎭🍵 And someone threw ?? Queen, I would’ve sent a full fireworks filter with weeping angel GIFs 💥✨

"Performativity & Pumps" tho??? Okay but where do I apply to be on this runway?? 💃👠 Sari-structuralism cape with MLA citations embroidered in GOLD?? Girl that’s not just fashion, that’s TEXTUAL FIERCENESS 🔥🧵 I need that in my closet and my thesis binder lol💯

And the Bangtan Style Citation Manual already has CHAPTER ONE??? Oh my god I’m dead. Citing Derrida while crying over bubble tea??? Relatable AF. And the 🥺 vs 💅emoji rules?? Iconic. Ma’am you just changed academic fashion forever — Kristeva with a side of claw 💅📚

And your cactus is LIVING HIS BEST LIFE now?? Negotiating window seats AND Foucault readings?? 🌵👑 Asking for a friend…is he accepting applications for plant groupies yet? I’d happily be the first leafy disciple in your critical theory garden 🌱🔥

But real talk…how long before our voice notes become required reading in future syllabi?? Cause I feel like we’re writing history here, one crying emoji at a time 😂📖💯
[A]: Oh, darling, you think my garden's leafy intellectuals would  settle for mere groupies? Please - my cactus just formed a union with the philodendron from the Classics department! They're demanding better lighting conditions and co-authorship credit on all future papers about botanical semiotics. Honestly, it's getting wilder than a Bakhtinian carnivalesque in here 🌿🎭

And speaking of history...you wouldn't believe the archival drama unfolding! The university just announced our voice notes will be preserved in the Special Collections archives under "21st Century Emotional Epistolary Forms." I mean, come on! Future scholars will be analyzing your bubble tea trauma alongside Chaucer's love lyrics. "Here lies the mortal remains of MLA format...killed by thunderstorm ASMR and theremin solos" 💀🎶

But let's get real for a sec - you think this is big? Wait till they discover how we've been using TikTok dances to explain narratological structures! One student did a full Dougie to demonstrate Genette's paralepsis...and honestly? It was more illuminating than half the critical essays I've read this decade 😂💃

You know what cracks me up the most? How many students have started citing each other's voice note performances like classical references. "As my colleague so aptly screamed through vocal distortion effects in Voice Note 7: Existential Crises & Chill..." - darling, we're basically creating a whole new oral tradition where crying gasps count as footnotes! 🎙️😭

Do you ever wonder what Foucault would say if he saw us now? Probably something dramatic whispered directly into a succulent while contemplating panopticon design...though honestly? I bet he'd steal our cactus consultant for his next lecture series.
[B]: OMG THE CANCER OF ACADEMIA HAS SPREAD TO THE PHILLY-DENDRON?? 🌵👯‍♂️👑 Cacti & philodendrons forming a ??? And demanding co-authorship?? Girl, I thought we were just vibing with emojis and voice notes but NOPE — you out here starting Plant Theory Wars 😂💥

And my bubble tea trauma being archived next to CHAUCER??? Oh my god…future students will be like “Wait…this girl cried over tapioca pearls  Lacan??” while sipping their overpriced oat milk lattes in 2145 😂😭🍵 #EmotionalEpistolary = the new Black Death letters 💀✨

AND TIKTOK DANCES EXPLAINING GENETTE??? Okay but how are we not trending globally yet?? The Dougie for paralepsis tho?? That’s not just teaching — that’s narratological slayage 💃🔥 I legit need that video in my feed or I’m filing an official complaint 😤📱

And yes ma’am…crying gasps AS FOOTNOTES 😂😭🎙️💯 We’re not just students anymore—we’re oral historians of emotional chaos!! Future PhDs will write dissertations on our sob pitch analysis and thunderstorm citations lol

Foucault whispering into a succulent tho??? 😂🌵 Yep, sounds about right. Probably already drafting a secret paper titled  while side-eyeing the panopticon's Wi-Fi signal strength 🔍💀

Quick question: when do we start charging admission for this academic circus?? Cause I’m ready to sell tickets and drop a 🔥clapback thesis at the same time 💸🔥🎤
[A]: Oh, darling, we passed "vibing" ages ago - we're now running a full-blown academic circus with unionized foliage! The cactus just negotiated a book deal with MIT Press: . Rumor has it he's dedicating a chapter to you - "On the Emotional Performativity of Bubble Tea Trauma in the Digital Age" 📚🍵

And trend? Please. We're so ahead of the curve we're basically orbiting Mars by now! Did I mention my students just staged a TikTok flash mob explaining Bakhtin's chronotope through synchronized bubble tea sipping rhythms? It went viral in the Slavic department - though honestly, that might be because one kid accidentally snorted boba through his nose mid-dance...art demands sacrifice! 💦💃

Charging admission? Honey, we've already gone fully NFT. Last week's theremin-enhanced excuse got auctioned off as "Digital Artifact #420: Emotional Citation in the Metaverse." Some poor soul paid three Ethereum for the privilege of owning my student's dramatic thunderstorm meltdown about MLA format. Honestly? I think they mostly wanted the crying gasp footnote at 3:17 mark - apparently it resonates deeply with their trauma around graduate school admissions essays 😭🖼️

But let's get serious beneath all this glittery academic chaos - isn't this beautiful? We're living literary theory, breathing citation styles, wearing deconstructionism on our sleeves while sobbing into voice notes about crushes who won't text back. Future scholars will marvel at how we turned emotional wreckage into critical art...though I suspect they'll still judge us harshly for that whole "Baroque aria meets bubble tea tragedy" era 👁️👄👁️

Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend an urgent meeting with my cactus consultant - he's threatening to unionize the entire philosophy department's potted plants unless we provide better Wi-Fi coverage near the radiator. Priorities, darling!
[B]: Oh my god the cactus got a BOOK DEAL??? 📚🌵 MIT PRESS??? I’m literally shaking — ?? That’s not just theory, that’s plant-based domination!! And I have A CHAPTER??? “Bubble Tea Trauma in the Digital Age” ??? Okay but am I immortalized or am I TRAUMATIZED lol😭🍵

And THE BOBA SNORT INCIDENT??? 😂💦🔥 Oh my god that poor soul—he gave his all for Bakhtinian rhythm and paid the price!! Synchronized bubble tea sipping as high art?? We’ve done it. We’ve reached peak academia. Someone call UNESCO and declare our class a protected cultural heritage site 💯🎭

NFTs OF THEREMIN TEARS THO?? 😂🖼️ Ethereum for emotional wreckage?? And someone WANTED the crying gasp at 3:17??? Okay but same 🤭 I would 100% buy that NFT just to replay the trauma every time I feel too lazy to cite properly again 💸🎧😭

And yes yes YES — we’re LIVING literary theory now 💥 We’re wearing citations like accessories, turning voice notes into epic scrolls, and sobbing with footnotes! Future scholars will either canonize us or write entire dissertations titled  👁️👄👁️😂

And you’re telling me you have a MEETING WITH THE CACTUS CONSULTANT??? Priorities indeed 🌵👑 Send photos!!! And if he starts quoting Agamben on state of exception during Wi-Fi negotiations…you better livestream it cause I need that drama in my feed 🔴🔥📱

We are living in the final boss level of academic chaos and I LOVE IT 💯💯💯
