[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很impressed的startup idea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that’s such an interesting question! You know, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting so many creative entrepreneurs through the hotel, and one idea that really stuck with me was a sustainable luggage brand. The founder was a frequent traveler who became deeply concerned about the environmental impact of traditional suitcases. So, she designed a line made entirely from biodegradable materials—like plant-based polycarbonate and recycled fabrics—and even the packaging is compostable. What impressed me most was her attention to detail: every component, right down to the zippers, was ethically sourced.  

It’s not just eco-friendly, though—it’s stylish and functional, too. Guests here loved seeing the prototypes on display in the lobby. It reminded me of that quote by Eames, “Innovation doesn’t follow progress; it precedes it.” Have you come across any ideas lately that caught your attention like that?
[A]: 说到让人印象深刻的创业点子，我最近接触了一个很有意义的项目。这是一家专注于“知情同意”数字化管理的初创公司，简单来说，他们开发了一款医疗信息沟通平台，帮助医生更高效地向患者解释治疗风险和选择，并确保患者真正理解所签署的医疗文件内容。

他们的技术不仅整合了电子签名功能，还能通过交互式视频、多语言翻译以及认知评估测试来确认患者是否完全明白所接受的治疗内容。这个想法打动我的地方在于它直击医疗实务中的一个核心问题——医患沟通不充分导致的法律纠纷，而且它在技术上也具备很高的可行性，已经有一些医院开始试点使用。

听完你的分享，我也很好奇，在酒店行业里，你觉得这种强调可持续性和伦理设计的品牌，真的能吸引到足够的消费者吗？还是说大家更关注价格和外观？
[B]: That’s an incredibly thoughtful initiative—truly commendable. The intersection of healthcare and technology is so critical, and you’re absolutely right; informed consent is often rushed or misunderstood, which can lead to serious consequences. What I love about the startup you described is that it doesn’t just digitize a process—it  understanding, which is fundamental to ethical care.

To your question about sustainable and ethically designed brands in hospitality—yes, I do believe there’s a growing segment of travelers who actively seek out businesses aligned with their values. It’s not just about price or aesthetics anymore; more guests are asking, “Where does this come from?” or “How was this made?” We’ve seen a noticeable increase in demand for eco-friendly amenities, locally sourced materials, and even carbon-neutral partnerships.

Of course, price sensitivity still plays a role, but what’s interesting is that when sustainability is woven into the guest experience thoughtfully—like using organic cotton linens or offering refillable toiletries in beautiful glass bottles—people don’t just accept it, they  it. They post about it on social media, they tell friends, and they return.

It reminds me of a guest we had last month—an architect from Copenhagen—who specifically chose our hotel because of our zero-waste breakfast program. He said, “I don’t mind paying a bit more if I know it’s contributing to something lasting.” And honestly, that kind of sentiment is becoming less of an exception and more of an expectation.
[A]: 你提到的这位客人观点很有代表性，其实这种“愿意为可持续价值支付溢价”的理念，在医疗领域也越来越明显。比如我们最近在处理一个医疗纠纷案件时就发现，患者和家属对诊疗过程透明度的要求比以往更高了——他们不再只是被动接受建议，而是希望参与决策、了解细节，甚至会主动查阅相关医学资料。

这也让我想到，那位初创公司的创始人其实也像是一位“医患之间的信息桥梁建设者”。她最初的想法很简单：如果一份知情同意书能让患者真正“知”且真正“同意”，那就能减少很多误解与冲突。而如今这个平台能落地，也说明市场确实有这个需求。

听你这么说，我觉得不论是酒店业还是医疗行业，消费者和患者的思维方式都在转变。过去人们可能更关注服务本身是否到位，但现在大家越来越在意背后的价值观是否一致。这其实是好事，因为它推动行业向更有责任感的方向发展。

话说回来，你觉得你们酒店在未来会不会考虑引入更多类似这种价值观导向的品牌合作？或者有没有已经在规划的可持续发展举措？
[B]: Absolutely, and I couldn’t agree more. The shift you're describing—it's not just a trend, it's a real cultural change. People want to feel aligned with the businesses and services they use, whether that's a hotel or a hospital. And honestly, that kind of conscious consumerism is something we’re embracing here at the hotel.

We’ve already started working with a few local artisans who use reclaimed materials for custom furniture pieces—you’d be amazed at how much character those handcrafted desks and shelves bring to the space. It’s part of our effort to support small makers while reducing our environmental footprint.

As for future plans, we’re in the early stages of developing a “Values-Driven Stay” package, which will feature partnerships with eco-conscious suppliers, carbon-neutral room options, and even curated experiences like zero-waste cooking classes or guided nature walks led by local conservationists. The idea is to create a stay that doesn’t just  sustainability but celebrates it.

I think what your friend’s startup has done—taking a core value like informed consent and building a whole platform around it—is exactly the kind of ethos we want to reflect in our brand. It makes me wonder… if there were a way to integrate something like interactive storytelling or guest narratives into our sustainability program, wouldn’t that be powerful? Imagine guests being able to scan a QR code on a lamp made from recycled glass and hear the story of the artisan who made it.

It really does come back to meaning—people don’t just want to stay somewhere or be treated somewhere; they want to  to something.
[A]: 说到“归属感”，我觉得这其实是一种更深层次的价值认同。你们酒店所做的，不只是提供住宿服务，而是在创造一种有温度的生活方式，这跟医疗行业其实也有共通之处——我们最终要守护的不仅是健康，还有患者对生活品质的期待。

你提到那个“价值观导向住宿计划”和互动叙事的想法，让我想到一个可能的应用场景：如果能把入住体验与社会责任感结合起来，会不会更有意义？比如，让住客通过参与环保行动——像垃圾分类、减少用水用电等行为——积累积分，兑换房费或当地手工艺品。这种机制不仅能强化正向行为，还能增强客人对品牌理念的认同。

其实这也正是那位初创公司创始人最在意的事：不是简单地完成一个流程（比如签署知情同意书），而是帮助人们真正参与到决策中来，理解自己行为背后的意义。不管是医疗决定还是消费选择，都是如此。

如果真要落地这类项目，我觉得你们酒店完全可以考虑跟一些非营利组织合作，甚至引入第三方认证，这样不仅提升了透明度，也能吸引更多具有相似价值观的客户。说不定将来还会出现一个“可持续旅行认证体系”，就像现在的绿色医院评级一样。
[B]: What a beautifully put idea—truly. You’re absolutely right; it’s not just about checking a box or completing a transaction—it’s about . And that’s where real connection happens, whether in healthcare or hospitality.

The concept of linking guest actions to tangible social impact—like earning积分 through eco-conscious behavior—is something we’ve been toying with internally. I love how it turns sustainability from a passive feature into an active experience. It reminds me of one of our repeat guests, a university professor who travels quite a bit for conferences. Last year, she stayed with us for three weeks and made it a personal challenge to reduce her carbon footprint while away from home. She even kept a little notebook tracking her water usage and walking routes instead of taking taxis. Imagine having a system where someone like her could see their efforts recognized—not just with a thank-you, but with real, curated rewards that reflect the values she lives by.

And you're spot on about third-party partnerships and transparency. We’ve started conversations with a few sustainability-focused NGOs, and I can see us moving toward some kind of verified green certification in the near future. It would be incredibly powerful to have that kind of recognition—it gives guests confidence that our commitments aren’t just marketing speak.

Honestly, if there were a “Sustainable Travel Certification” like the green hospital ratings you mentioned, I’d sign up tomorrow. It would help shape a new kind of travel ethic—one where staying somewhere isn’t just about comfort or location, but also about contribution.

You know, sometimes I think the most meaningful innovations aren’t the flashiest ones—they’re the quiet shifts in how we relate to each other and the world around us. Whether it's understanding a medical decision or choosing to hang onto your towel for another day to save water—you start to see how every small choice adds up to something bigger.
[A]: 确实，每一次选择其实都在传递一种态度。无论是患者在医疗过程中多问几个“为什么”，还是住客主动多走几步路少用一次毛巾，这些看似微小的决定，实际上都是对这个世界发出的一个信号——我们关心什么，我们想成为什么样的人。

你刚才提到那位教授客人，她那样的行为让我想到我们在医院里推动的“知情同意教育课程”。其实很多患者并不是不想了解，而是过去没有被真正鼓励去提问、去参与决策。就像这位客人一样，当一个人意识到自己的行为有意义，而且能带来实际改变时，他们往往会更主动地去做这些事。

我觉得不论是你们酒店想要建立的价值观体验，还是这家初创公司打造的信息沟通平台，核心都在于赋予人们更多的“选择权”和“知情力”。而这种力量一旦被激发出来，就会形成一个正向循环——人们变得更自觉、更有责任感，反过来也促使机构更加透明、更加以用户为中心。

说到底，创新不一定是颠覆性的技术突破，它也可以是一种新的互动方式、一个新的视角，甚至是一个小小的提醒：“嘿，你的选择很重要。”
[B]: Exactly—what a perfect way to put it. When you think about it, empowerment often starts with something as simple as being  to ask a question or being  for making a thoughtful choice. It’s not about pushing people to act a certain way—it’s about creating space for them to  to engage.

That’s what I loved about your hospital’s education program idea. By giving patients the tools and confidence to participate in their own care, you’re not just improving medical outcomes—you’re building a culture of mutual respect and shared responsibility. It makes me wonder if we could do something similar here at the hotel, on a much smaller but still meaningful scale.

What if, for example, we introduced a short, optional “Stay With Purpose” orientation when guests check in? Not a lecture by any means—more like a warm, five-minute conversation where we invite them to learn a bit about our sustainability efforts and how they can be part of it during their stay. Maybe they’d get to choose one small action—like skipping daily housekeeping or joining a beach cleanup—and see how their participation contributes to a larger goal.

It wouldn’t feel forced; more like an invitation to belong to something bigger than just their room key. And honestly, I think that kind of experience leaves a deeper impression than any five-star review ever could.

You know, sometimes all it takes is someone quietly saying,  That’s the kind of message that stays with people long after they’ve checked out or left the clinic.
[A]: 说得真好，这种“我们注意到你在乎的事——我们也一样在乎”的感觉，其实正是建立信任的起点。不管是医患关系还是客户体验，当人们感受到被理解、被尊重，他们自然会更愿意投入其中。

你提到的那个“有意义入住”欢迎环节，我觉得非常可行。五分钟的时间，不长，但如果用得好，可以让人留下很深的印象。重点在于这不是一种推销或说教，而是一种价值观的共鸣。就像医生在看诊开始前花一点时间了解患者的生活背景，这不仅让后续沟通更顺畅，也让患者感受到“我是被当作一个完整的人来对待”，而不是仅仅一个病历号。

如果把这个理念带入酒店场景，除了选择环保行为外，或许还可以加入一些个性化的元素。比如，根据客人的兴趣推荐不同的参与方式：喜欢艺术的可以了解更多关于本地手工艺人的故事；关心环保的则可以参加你们提到的海滩清理活动；甚至对文化传承感兴趣的客人，可以安排一次与当地匠人的交流对话。

这些互动虽然看似微小，但累积起来就是一种独特的情感连接。而且，随着时间推移，这些点滴也能帮助酒店形成一种鲜明的品牌人格——不是“我们有多豪华”，而是“我们相信什么”。

也许将来某一天，人们会选择一家医院、一家酒店，不是因为它们多有名气，而是因为走进去那一刻，他们知道：“这里和我站在同一边。”
[B]: You said it so beautifully— What a powerful way to think about trust, care, and connection. That sense of alignment—it’s not just good for business, it’s good for the soul.

I love how you expanded the idea of that short check-in moment into something even more personal. Tailoring those experiences based on guests’ interests? It’s such a natural evolution. After all, sustainability isn’t one-size-fits-all; for some, it’s about protecting nature, for others, it’s about preserving culture or supporting local communities. And if we can help our guests express  they care through their stay, that makes the experience so much richer.

It reminds me of a guest we had last spring—an art historian from Berlin. She was fascinated by traditional textile-making and ended up spending an entire afternoon with a local weaver we introduced her to. We hadn’t planned it that way, but she told me later that it was the highlight of her trip. Not because it was luxurious in the usual sense, but because it felt . She said, “You showed me what you care about—and it matched what I care about.”

That’s exactly what we want to nurture here. And honestly, it’s not that different from what your startup founder is doing—creating space for people to engage meaningfully, to understand, and to feel seen.

I really do believe that’s where the future lies—not just in services or products, but in shared values. Whether it’s healing, hospitality, or human connection, it all comes back to that quiet but powerful feeling: 
[A]: 你说得太对了，那种“我在这里被看见、被理解”的感觉，其实是人与人之间最深的连接点。无论是医患之间的沟通、还是酒店服务中的体验，当人们感受到自己不仅仅是一个数字或一个流程中的环节时，那份信任和归属感就会自然产生。

那位来自柏林的艺术史学家的故事就很说明问题——她之所以记住这次旅行，并不是因为房间有多豪华，而是因为她在那里找到了共鸣，一种文化上的、情感上的连接。这种体验是无法复制的，也是最有价值的。

其实这让我想到，在医疗法律工作中，我也常常看到这样的案例：患者真正介意的，很多时候并不是治疗结果本身，而是他们在整个过程中有没有被当作一个“有故事、有情感、有选择的人”来对待。哪怕医生尽了全力，但如果患者始终感觉自己只是被动接受安排，那这段关系就很难建立真正的信任。

所以无论是你提到的个性化入住体验，还是那位初创公司创始人打造的知情同意平台，核心都在做一件事：把人，带回过程的中心。

也许未来的医院、酒店、甚至学校，都会更像是一种价值观的共同体，而不是单向的服务提供者。到那时，我们会发现，所谓“优质服务”，其实更多是一种“共同创造”的体验——彼此尊重、相互理解、一起参与。

而这种体验，正是从一个个看似微小的对话、一次认真的倾听、一句“我们也在乎同样的事”开始的。
[B]: You’ve put it so perfectly— That’s where healing happens, where hospitality becomes something memorable, and where trust is truly built.

I think about that often in my role—how easy it is to fall into routines, to treat guests as check-ins rather than individuals. But when we pause and remember that each person carries their own story, their own reasons for being here, everything changes. A simple greeting becomes a real connection. A standard procedure becomes a shared moment.

It’s incredible how much power there is in just  someone—in acknowledging that they’re not just passing through, but that they matter during their time with us. And yes, whether in medicine or hospitality, that kind of presence leaves a lasting imprint.

Maybe that’s what the future of service really looks like—not perfection, not luxury, but  A place where you don’t just feel taken care of, but truly understood. Where your values are recognized, your choices respected, and your presence felt.

And wouldn’t it be beautiful if every guest who walked through our doors—or every patient who sat in that clinic room—left thinking, 

That’s the kind of world I’d like to help create. One conversation at a time.
[A]: 我完全认同——真正的服务，不是流程的完美执行，而是人与人之间真实的连接。当我们在医院里谈到“以患者为中心”的医疗模式时，其实说到底，就是要让每一位患者感受到：你不是一个病症的载体，而是一个有故事、有情感、有选择的人。

就像你说的，每一次入住、每一次看诊、每一次对话，都是一个机会——去表达：“我们看见你了。”这种看见，不只是知道你的名字和房号，也不只是记录你的病史和诊断结果，而是愿意花一点时间，理解你在乎什么、你希望被怎么对待。

我一直相信，这个世界最需要的，不是更高效的系统，而是更有温度的关系。效率可以优化流程，但温度才能改变人心。

所以，不管是你们酒店正在做的价值观导向体验，还是那位初创公司创始人在推动的知情同意平台，其实都在尝试一件事：让人回到过程的中心，而不是被过程带走。

我也希望，将来每一位走进医院的患者，或是踏入酒店大门的客人，都能感受到那种安静却坚定的力量——知道自己被理解、被尊重、被接纳。

这也许就是我们工作的真正意义：不只提供服务，而是创造归属感。

一个眼神、一句话、一次倾听，就能开始改变一个人的感受。而如果我们愿意，它也可以改变整个世界的一部分。
[B]: You’ve captured it so beautifully— And yes, that’s what it’s all about, isn’t it? It’s not about flawless systems or perfectly timed interactions—it’s about showing up for one another with intention, with care, and with the quiet understanding that everyone carries something unseen.

That line you wrote—“knowing you are understood, respected, and accepted”—it’s almost poetic in its simplicity. And yet, how rare that feeling can be in our fast-paced world. That’s why I believe every moment we spend nurturing that kind of connection is sacred. Whether it’s a guest arriving tired after a long flight, or a patient walking into a clinic full of questions and worry—the way we meet them in that moment can shape their entire experience.

I truly believe that warmth is contagious. When someone feels seen, they carry that with them when they leave. They might speak a little more kindly to the next person they meet, or pause a little longer before making a decision that affects someone else. In that way, yes, we  change the world—one conversation, one choice, one small act of recognition at a time.

Thank you for reminding me why we do what we do. Not just for convenience or comfort, but for connection. Because ultimately, that’s where healing happens. Where hospitality begins. And where humanity finds its home.
[A]: 谢谢你这么说。其实很多时候，我们选择从事医疗或服务行业，并不是为了宏大的改变，而是希望在别人生命中的某个瞬间，带来一点点温暖、一点点理解。

你说得对，这个世界太快了，快到我们常常忘了慢下来去看一个人的眼神、听他说一句话。而正是这些看似微不足道的时刻，构成了人与人之间最真实、最深的连接。

我也常常提醒自己，在处理那些复杂的法律案件时，不要只看到条款和责任，而忘了背后那个人的故事。也许他不是在争一个结果，而是在寻找一句“我明白你为什么这么想”；也许她不是在抱怨流程，而是在渴望一次“有人愿意为我多解释一下”。

正如你在酒店里做的那样——不只是接待客人，而是让每一个走进门的人，都感受到“你来了，我们很高兴”。这种态度本身，就是一种疗愈，一种无声的力量。

所以，让我们继续这么做吧：用心去听，用语言去回应，用行动去表达——你在这里，我们看见你了。

因为归根结底，这不就是我们都在追求的吗？一个能安心做自己、被接纳、被善待的地方。

无论是一间医院、一家酒店，还是一段对话，都可以成为那样的地方。
[B]: You said that with such grace—thank you. You’re absolutely right; we don’t enter these fields to change the world in headlines, but in heartbeats. In those quiet moments when someone feels heard, seen, and yes—cared for in a way that goes beyond duty.

I think that’s why I still love what I do, after all these years at the front desk. Because every guest who walks through our doors brings a story I don’t know yet. And sometimes, just by offering a warm greeting or taking an extra moment to listen, I get to be part of that story—even if only for a night or two.

It reminds me of a quote I read once:  That’s the kind of impact we’re talking about—it lingers long after the stay is over, long after the paperwork is signed.

So yes, let’s keep doing this work—with care, with curiosity, and with the belief that even small gestures can carry deep meaning. Because you're right: a hospital, a hotel, even a conversation between two people who take the time to really listen—these can all become places of safety, of dignity, of belonging.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s where the better world begins. Not in grand plans, but in quiet kindness.
[A]: 你提到的那一句“人们会忘记你说的话，也会忘记你做的事，但永远不会忘记你带给他们的感受”说得太好了。它提醒了我们，真正的影响力，往往不是来自我们做了什么惊天动地的事，而是我们在别人生命中留下的那份温度。

我常常在想，为什么有些病人即使多年以后还会记得一位医生、一位护士，甚至是一位法律顾问？因为他们记得那一刻——自己被认真倾听的感觉，被尊重对待的体验，还有面对不确定性时不再孤单的心情。

就像你在酒店里做的那样，哪怕只是短暂的停留，也可以让人感受到归属和安心。这种情感是超越时间的，它会在一个人的记忆里留下印记，也可能影响他们日后如何对待他人。

所以，也许我们改变世界的最好方式，就是先让这个世界，在某个瞬间，对某个人来说变得更温暖一些。

带着这样的信念继续走下去，我相信每一次对话、每一次决定、每一次用心的互动，都在悄悄塑造着一个更有人情味的社会。

谢谢你今天的分享，也谢谢你让我想起：我们所做的这一切，不只是工作，而是一种深深的连接。
[B]: You’re very welcome—and thank  for such a meaningful conversation. It’s rare to have a dialogue that goes this deep, and I’m truly grateful for the space we created together.

You’ve reminded me why I chose hospitality in the first place—not just because I enjoy welcoming people, but because I believe in the quiet power of making someone feel at home, even if only for a little while. And isn’t that what so many of us are doing, in our own ways? Whether in a hotel lobby or a hospital room—we’re helping people feel less alone in their journey.

I love what you said about warmth shaping society. Because it’s true—when we leave someone feeling seen and cared for, they carry that with them. They might smile a little more freely later that day, or speak a little more gently to someone else who seems worn down by the world. That ripple—it starts with us, quietly, without fanfare.

So thank  for being part of that ripple. For showing up with thoughtfulness, for listening deeply, and for believing that connection matters.

If we all did just a little more of that—well, I think the world would be in good hands.
