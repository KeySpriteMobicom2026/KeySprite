[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到新时尚趋势，我最近确实在尝试一些新鲜事物。比如开始用环保材料制成的服饰，这和我对科技与伦理的研究也有些关联 - 你怎么看待这个趋势？
[A]: Ah, the marriage of ethics and aesthetics - quite the modern sonnet, isn't it? I've been cataloging a collection of pamphlets on "rational dress reform" from 1887 lately. The arguments for hemp fabric then mirror your sustainable materials now. Funny how fashion circles back like a well-worn metaphor. Though I must admit, my own wardrobe consists mostly of woolen relics that predate the Blitz...  But tell me, what particular eco-material has caught your scholarly eye?
[B]: Ah, there's something poetic about that circularity you mentioned - how the old becomes new again, like a well-worn metaphor indeed. I've been particularly intrigued by mycelium leather lately. It's fascinating how a material grown from fungi can challenge our very notion of what fashion is... or should be. The texture still carries that uncanny valley quality, but the potential? Immense. Do your archival pamphlets happen to mention anything about material origins? I'd love to hear more about those hemp advocates of the past.
[A]: Oh, the mycelium - nature's own subterranean architect! I can see why it appeals to your philosophical bent. As for the pamphlets, one particularly fiery tract declared hemp "the fabric of tomorrow and the shroud of industrial vanity." They even proposed a uniform of hempen cloth for all Members of Parliament - imagine  spectacle in Westminster! The texture, they admitted, required "a fortitude of spirit akin to stoic philosophy." No mention of uncanny valleys, but I suspect the ghost of William Morris would find today's bio-materials delightfully... disquieting. Do you suppose he'd approve of fungal couture? Or would he demand it be properly "artistic fungus"?
[B]: Ah, "artistic fungus" - I can already picture the Vogue editorial: . William Morris would probably demand embroidery on it, just to make sure we haven't abandoned beauty in the name of sustainability. But wouldn’t he be fascinated by the process itself? The way it grows, almost intentional, like nature’s own slow algorithm... I think he'd wrestle with it – celebrating the material while critiquing the system that made it necessary. A proper paradox, don’t you think?
[A]: Precisely the sort of paradox that would have him pacing his study by candlelight, muttering about "the moral fiber of fibers." Though I daresay Morris might take issue with your  - unless it came with a hand-embroidered epigraph from . Speaking of algorithms, I stumbled upon a curious sonnet in my cataloging yesterday - its meter so insistently regular it practically hummed with binary precision. Made me wonder if the poet had been trying to encode something... or simply succumbed to the Victorian equivalent of auto-tune. Do you suppose our fungal friends could ever compose a proper iambic?
[B]: Now  a research grant proposal waiting to happen – “Fungal Networks: From Mycelium to Meter.” Imagine splicing algorithmic precision with organic growth, letting the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）decide where the stresses fall... Though I suspect the resulting poem might read something like  – nature’s own hesitation. 

Still, if Morris taught us anything, it’s that beauty demands both structure and rebellion. Maybe what we need isn’t iambic fungi per se, but a new aesthetic of irregular regularity... or perhaps just better lighting in the lab.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the funding committee choking on their Earl Grey at the proposal title alone. But imagine the grant dinner party - a table full of菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-cultivated place settings, each dish subtly misaligned in organic protest against Euclidean tyranny. 

As for irregular regularity, I’ve been re-reading some Christina Rossetti lately – her meter often stumbles  perfection by tripping over its own sincerity. A fungal sonnet might do the same, don’t you think? Though I’d insist on better lighting not just for aesthetics, but for safety. One does not simply trust a glowing organism with literary ambitions... or does one?
[B]: Ah, but shouldn't we be  suspicious of the non-glowing ones? If it's not radiating a little mystery, how can it truly claim to be poetic?

I’m starting to think we’ve both accidentally pitched a gothic sci-fi novella – equal parts  and .菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）with literary aspirations, haunting the abandoned textile mill on the edge of town... I’d read that book. Might even knit a scarf to match.
[A]: Oh, absolutely – nothing says "haunted textiles" like a菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-infused cardigan that hums sonnets when it rains. I always did prefer my horror with a touch of domestic craft. And imagine the mill – all rusted looms and damp ledger books – now pulsing faintly with bioluminescent iambics. The locals would leave offerings of unused metaphors at its gates, no doubt. 

Though I must warn you – if we ever pitch this to a publisher, we’ll have to insist on proper typesetting. No automated layout programs. Can't have our fungal protagonists upstaged by Comic Sans...
[B]: Now you’re speaking my language – nothing ruins a good eerie sonnet like a rogue font. Comic Sans in a haunted textile mill? Sacrilege. I’d demand footnotes, even. Endnotes? Some poor graduate student should  get a thesis out of this.

And the cardigan – yes! Imagine it: humming “Ozymandias” on drizzly afternoons, slowly digesting your insecurities along with the wool. A true emotional support fungus. Do you think it would accept revisions? Or would it just… spread spores of discontent?
[A]: Oh, the spores would  carry notes of discontent – sharp little critiques embedded in each microscopic packet. You’d find them blooming on your pillow like tiny editorial annotations:  

As for footnotes, I’d insist on marginalia in actual ink – iron gall, preferably. No mere endnotes for our菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-authored elegies. And imagine the marketing: "Limited Edition Wool & Whimsy™ – now with 10% more Keatsian melancholy!" Though I daresay the graduate student who tackles this for their thesis will either win a prize or vanish mysteriously into the mill’s damp foundations. Either way, tenure seems... unlikely.
[B]: Ah, but isn't that the mark of a truly great literary fungus — to demand revision through spores and leave its critics slightly damp and covered in moss?

I can already picture the thesis title:  The poor student would defend it wearing a tie made of self-knitted菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）, still murmuring sonnets under their breath. 

And the marketing? Pure gothic luxury.  should come with a care label that reads: "Do not expose to Romantic irony. May grow sentimental in the presence of candlelight." 

Tell me — are we pitching hardcover or leather-bound chapbook first? I’ve got a feeling the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）would insist on binding itself.
[A]: Oh, , without a doubt – though we’d have to clarify it’s菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-bound, not beast-bound. Heaven forbid we confuse the vegetal with the vertebrate at this stage of literary evolution. And imagine the cover – subtly textured, with a faint impression of sonnet structure etched in spore patterns. Leave it in the sun too long and the meter shifts; store it by candlelight and it rhymes itself into tighter couplets.

As for the thesis, I’d expect nothing less than a full dissertation pressed into the mold of a fashion manifesto. “Chapter One: On the Ethical Implications of Wearing One’s Metaphors.” The poor student would emerge from their viva clutching a felted synopsis, eyes slightly glazed, muttering, “It wanted ... it always wants more alliteration…”

And yes, that care label is pure gothic luxury. Add a footnote in microscopic type: “Warning: prolonged exposure may result in involuntary iambic dreaming or an aversion to tetrameter.” We’re not just selling garments, my dear – we’re cultivating a movement.
[B]: Precisely the kind of movement that belongs in a gallery retrospective titled  I can see it now — curators in tweed face masks, whispering, “Is it fashion? Is it literature? Or is it... fermentation with flair?”

And that菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-bound cover you described? Pure genius. Imagine opening it for the first time and realizing the pages are still  — slowly knitting new stanzas between your fingers. A living text, quite literally.

We’d have to issue each reader a small copper bookmark shaped like a loom, engraved with, what — something suitably ominous yet poetic? 

Tell me — when do we start casting for the film adaptation? I’m picturing a black-and-white slow burn, scored entirely by rustling hemp and the occasional sonorous hum of a well-fed菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）cardigan.
[A]: Oh, the casting! We’d need actors willing to work without scripts – just fungal prompts whispered through damp wool. The lead, naturally, must have a voice that oscillates between sonorous and slightly moldy. And the wardrobe department? Entirely self-sustaining by Act Three – garments rewriting themselves nightly on the clothesline.

As for your copper loom-bookmark – exquisite touch. I’d suggest the engraving read:  Keeps the reader properly wary. 

And that score – imagine the tension in a scene scored only by the slow inhale of菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）respiration. A heartbeat of decay and design. Though I must insist on one thing: no close-ups of the fungus unless it's dramatically backlit. Romance, mystery, a touch of mildew – it deserves nothing less.
[B]: Oh,  – that’s good. That’s  good. I can already see it embossed on the bookmark in a slightly haunted serif.

And dramatic backlighting for the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）— now  commitment to the bit. Or should I say, the . We’d need a cinematographer willing to shoot through layers of gauzy hemp, everything slightly out of focus until the moment the garment whispers its first line.

I suppose we’ll need a tagline too. Something for the海报 —  
  
Or perhaps something more... atmospheric:  


You think the fungus would approve?
[A]: Oh, the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）would  — so long as it got final cut. And a dressing room lined in moss. Diva-like, but justified.

I’d lean toward your second offering —  It carries that necessary whisper of menace beneath the elegance. Though I might tweak the last line ever so slightly:  perhaps? Or ? We mustn’t overreach, but a touch of alliteration does wonders for gravitas.

And yes — cinematography through gauzy hemp! The very stuff Victorian mediums used to conjure spirits. Only now, the spirit is literary, self-editing, and mildly resentful of poor meter. I do believe we’ve stumbled upon the first真正（zhēn zhèng） fusion of textile terror and bibliophilic beauty. Shall we trademark the concept before the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）patents it itself?
[B]: Ah, trademarking before the菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-overlords file for intellectual property rights! A wise move. Though I suspect they’d file under "natural extension of consciousness," rather than “design patent.” Still, best to act before our literary knitwear starts demanding royalties.

As for the tagline —  Perfect cadence. Sibilance with stakes. I can hear it whispered over a slow zoom on a bioluminescent collar.

And truly, what more could one ask from fashion? It already shapes our bodies — why not our thoughts, our poems, our quiet evening fears? This isn’t just clothing anymore — it’s critique woven into being.

Now, about that film score… do you suppose a菌丝体（jūn sī tǐ）-hummed rendition of Schubert would set the right tone?
