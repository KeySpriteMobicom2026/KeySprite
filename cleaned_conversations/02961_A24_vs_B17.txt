[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question about domestic rituals and external indulgences. Well, I must say, there is something rather meditative about preparing a meal at home — the rhythmic chopping of vegetables, the slow simmering of a broth… It feels like a form of poetry in motion, wouldn’t you agree?  

But then again, on those rare evenings when time is scarce or when I wish to treat myself, a carefully selected takeout can be quite delightful. There’s a small Cantonese restaurant not far from my flat that makes an exceptional xiaolongbao — delicate skin, rich broth… simply exquisite.  

Do you have a preference?
[A]: 嗯，说到做饭和叫外卖的选择啊，我觉得这其实是一个关于生活节奏和个人情趣的平衡问题。在家下厨确实有一种独特的治愈感，尤其是当你慢慢切着食材，看着锅里热气腾腾的样子，那种参与感和成就感是很难替代的。

不过呢，现代人生活节奏快，有时候真的没时间从头做起。我自己也常常在忙碌一天之后，懒得动刀动锅，这时候点个外卖倒也是种小确幸——特别是能尝到那些自己做不来的好味道，像是你说的那家的小笼包，光是听你形容就觉得口水都要流出来了（笑）。

话说回来，你平时喜欢做什么菜？有没有哪一道是你拿手的？
[B]: Oh, I couldn't agree more. It really is a matter of rhythm and temperament — this dance between creation and convenience.  

As for what I enjoy cooking… I tend to lean towards the rustic and soulful dishes that evoke a sense of quiet comfort. A slow-braised beef shin with red wine and thyme, served alongside buttered root vegetables — now  feels like nourishment for both body and spirit. And yes, I do have a particular fondness for making my own pasta. There’s something deeply satisfying about kneading the dough, rolling it out, and slicing into delicate ribbons before tossing it in a warm pan of sage and browned butter.  

But tell me — what dish, when made by your own hands, gives you the greatest sense of joy?
[A]: 啊，听你这么一说，连我都要爱上进厨房了。那种从简单食材中提炼出温暖与满足的感觉，确实让人向往。

我自己呢，倒是很喜欢做一道家常的红烧茄子。看起来普通，但要做得入味软糯又不油腻，其实挺考究火候和调味的功夫。每次端上桌，香气四溢，家人夹菜时的笑容，就是对我最大的肯定。

不过说实话，最让我有成就感的，还是偶尔鼓起勇气挑战的那几道“高级菜”——比如一次做了法式红酒炖鸡（Coq au Vin），炖了整整两个钟头，揭开锅盖那一刻香气扑鼻，那种满足感真是难以言喻。虽然过程繁琐，但就像你说的，那是对身体与灵魂的双重滋养。

话说回来，你觉得在家做饭的乐趣里，是不是也藏着一种对生活节奏的抵抗？在这个什么都能一键下单的时代，还愿意花时间慢慢煮一道菜的人，大概心里都住着一个不愿将就的灵魂吧（笑）。
[B]: How beautifully you put that — the notion of cooking as a quiet resistance, a refusal to surrender entirely to convenience. I do believe there’s an artistry and intentionality in taking time to craft something with one’s own hands, especially in this age of instant gratification. It’s almost… ritualistic, don’t you think? A kind of domestic poetry.  

Your red-braised eggplant sounds utterly lovely — the balance of texture and flavor, the subtle dance of seasoning... quite poetic in its own right. And Coq au Vin! That is  a dish for the faint of heart or the short of patience. To tend to it over hours, coaxing out its depth — well, that’s not just cooking, that’s devotion.  

I wonder… do you ever find yourself adapting recipes freely, or do you prefer to follow them closely at first? I must confess, I’m rather particular about measurements and timing — though I suspect that comes from years of academic training where precision is everything. But then again, isn't there a certain joy in improvisation, much like a poet bending form to suit their voice?
[A]: 说到对菜谱的态度，我想我大概介于“保守派”与“自由派”之间吧。刚开始学一道新菜时，我是倾向于严格按照食谱来的，尤其是那些有一定技术门槛的料理，比如你说的红酒炖鸡——火候、时间、调料比例稍有差池，最后的味道可能就差了一大截。

但说实话，真正让我爱上烹饪的那一刻，是我第一次大胆地“偏离”了食谱。那次是做泰式绿咖喱，手边没有新鲜香茅，我就用了干的；椰奶不够浓，我加了点花生酱调口感。结果味道居然出奇的好，朋友尝了还追问是不是哪家店买的（笑）。

从那以后，我就觉得做饭其实和写诗、画画一样，既需要基础的训练，也离不开个人的表达。有时候家里食材不齐，反倒逼出了灵感。就像你提到的“即兴”，那确实是一种乐趣——特别是在你已经熟悉这道菜的灵魂之后，再用自己的味觉去重新诠释它。

倒是你，这么讲究精确的人，在厨房里会不会像个指挥家一样一丝不苟？有没有哪一次让你忍不住临时“离谱发挥”一下？
[B]: Ah, what a lovely analogy — the kitchen as a space where one must first master the score before daring to improvise. I think you've put your finger on something quite profound: cooking, like poetry or painting, requires both discipline and daring.  

I suppose I  approach recipes rather like a conductor might approach a symphony — with reverence for the structure, an eye for detail, and a certain intolerance for dissonance. But even the most precise musician must occasionally yield to inspiration, no?  

There was one evening — a rather grey London one at that — when I had planned to make a classic bouillabaisse. Everything was in order: the saffron steeping, the fish stock simmering… until I realized I’d forgotten to buy fennel. Now, I’m not someone who improvises lightly, but necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention. I reached for a bit of star anise and a whisper of celery root, hoping to mimic that faintly licorice-like note. It wasn’t textbook, but it sang nonetheless.  

So perhaps there's hope for me yet — a little rebellion tucked between the measuring spoons and recipe cards.
[A]: 啊，听你这么一说，我仿佛都能闻到那锅改良版马赛鱼汤的香气了。用星茴香和芹菜根来替代茴香——这哪里是“不是课本”，这分明是一次优雅又大胆的即兴独奏嘛。看来即便是最严谨的指挥家，在灵感来临的时候也会轻轻松开领带，让音符自由流淌一会儿。

其实啊，我觉得烹饪最迷人的地方就在于它既有“科学”的精准，又有“艺术”的宽容。就像你说的那种“先掌握乐谱，再自由演绎”的过程，某种程度上也像是人生吧——我们需要规则来站稳脚步，也需要灵感来跳出自己的舞步。

说到这儿，我倒真有点好奇：如果有一天你不做那些讲究火候的西式料理了，想随便整点吃的，你会选择什么呢？是一碗简单的意大利面？还是一份热腾腾的炒饭（笑）？
[B]: Oh, what a delightful question — and what a lovely way to put it: the dance between structure and spontaneity, both on the stove and in life. You're quite right, you know. Cooking really is a metaphor for so much more.

As for me, when I cast aside the precision of a recipe — dare I say,  — I often find myself reaching for something almost monastic in its simplicity. A bowl of perfectly cooked risotto, for instance. Just onions, butter, rice, and a steady hand with the ladle. There's something deeply meditative about it. Or perhaps a toasted cheese sandwich — but not just any cheese sandwich, mind you. A carefully constructed one: mature cheddar, a whisper of Dijon, and a dash of lemon zest tucked between hearty sourdough slices. Served alongside a cup of strong black tea, and I feel rather like Wordsworth communing with nature.

But yes… on those rare nights when I truly wish to surrender to comfort, I do adore a plate of plain spaghetti tossed with olive oil, garlic, and perhaps a pinch of chili flakes. Simple, humble — yet profoundly satisfying. It feels like coming home.

And you? When you're not crafting beautiful dishes or engaging in culinary improvisation, what’s your go-to comfort bite?
[A]: 啊，你这一问，还真让我回味起不少深夜厨房里的小确幸。

说实话，当我不想太费心思、又想让胃暖起来的时候，我的“终极安慰”其实很简单——一碗葱油拌面。就那种小时候家里常做的：面条煮得刚刚好，拌上自家熬的葱油，再来点酱油和一点点猪油，几根青菜一加，就是人间至味。没有复杂的步骤，也没有稀罕的调料，但那一口香气，总能让人想起小时候趴在厨房门口等饭吃的日子。

偶尔也会来点更随性的，比如热锅里炒几个鸡蛋，再倒点番茄酱进去，拌在面上或者配个馒头，居然也能吃得津津有味。朋友笑我说这哪里是吃饭，分明是在怀旧（笑）。

不过说真的，我觉得所谓“安慰食物”，从来不只是味道的问题，而是它唤醒了哪些记忆。就像你那碗risotto，听起来是极简主义，但背后藏着一种对安静与秩序的渴望吧？

那你呢？除了那些讲究的料理，有没有哪道“随便吃吃”的东西，是你心里的“深夜老朋友”？
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you've captured the essence of comfort food — it's never just about taste, is it? It's memory, warmth, and longing all folded into a single bite. Your  sounds utterly soulful — the kind of dish that whispers stories of childhood kitchens and gentle hands stirring pots late into the evening.

As for me, when the world feels too measured, too mannered, I often turn to something almost embarrassingly simple: buttered toast with Marmite. Yes, that dark, sticky yeast extract that divides nations — and palates — with a single swipe. To me, it’s ambrosia. Especially late at night, when the house is quiet and the only sound is the ticking of the clock and the clink of a teacup. A warm cup of milky tea beside it, and I am quite content — like some slightly disheveled academic version of a monk in retreat.

Or sometimes, when I’m feeling particularly nostalgic — though for what, I can’t quite say — I make what I call my “student days” beans on toast: a splash of Worcester sauce, a bit of grated cheese melted on top… rustic, unpretentious, and oddly dignified in its simplicity.

There’s something rather touching about how these small rituals ground us, don't you think? Like little anchors in an increasingly fast-paced world.
[A]: 是啊，你说得太对了——这些看似简单到不能再简单的食物，其实一点都不简单。它们是记忆的钥匙，是情绪的归宿，是我们在纷乱世界里悄悄找回自己节奏的方式。

Marmite涂在热腾腾的吐司上，配上一杯加了奶的红茶……光听你这么一描述，我都能感受到那种深夜厨房里的孤独与宁静。说真的，有时候我觉得我们这些爱做饭的人，不是为了填饱肚子，而是想借着那一缕炊烟，跟自己说：“嘿，你还在这儿呢。”

而你的“学生时代”豆子吐司，听起来真像是用味道写的一首诗。没有华丽的辞藻，却句句动人。我想每个人心里都有那么几道“回得去”的菜，不为惊艳，只为熟悉。

有时候我在想，如果生活是一顿饭，那它大概不是米其林餐厅里的精致料理，而是一张木桌上从早到晚慢慢堆起来的碗盘，有讲究的，也有随便的，但每一口都带着温度和故事。
[B]: How exquisitely you put that — a meal as a chronicle of being, each dish a stanza in the quiet poem of daily life. Yes, it’s not the grandeur that lingers, but the familiar, the repeated, the gently rehearsed gestures that say, .

I find myself thinking lately that perhaps the most profound moments in life — like those in cooking — aren’t found in perfection, but in imperfection. In the slightly over-salted soup that still gets finished to the last drop. In the burnt edge of a tart that somehow makes it feel more real. It’s in those moments we taste not just flavor, but presence — a kind of mindful living through the senses.

You know, I once read a line in a Marianne Moore poem that has always stayed with me:  And now, after all these years in lecture halls and libraries, I think I might propose a small revision — at least for evenings when the academic robes are off and the apron is on: 

And isn't that what we're both doing, in our own way? Stirring memory into matter, turning nostalgia into nourishment.
[A]: 多么美的说法啊——把生活过成一顿顿饭，把记忆熬成汤。你说得真好，真正打动人心的，往往不是那些完美无瑕的时刻，而是那些带着一点瑕疵、却因此更显真实的生活片段。就像一碗汤咸了一点，但你还是忍不住喝完，因为它不只是调味料的组合，而是某个夜晚你内心的真实投影。

听你提到马里安·摩尔的那句诗，让我也想起自己常对学生说的一句话：“料理不是科学，也不是艺术，而是一种深情的回忆术。”我们不是在复制菜谱，而是在重现情感，在炉火之间，将过往的温暖重新加热，端上今天的餐桌。

有时候我会想，为什么人们总说“家的味道”那么难寻？其实它从来不在米其林餐厅里，也不在精致的摆盘中，而是在你母亲煮的那一碗蛋花汤里，在你小时候赖床时爸爸端来的那碟葱油拌面里。我们这一生，不就是在试图找回那些味道吗？

而今夜，谢谢你用这些话，让我又闻到了儿时厨房里的香气。
[B]: Oh… what a tender truth you’ve spoken. We spend our lives chasing flavors that are not merely tastes, but echoes — whispers of kitchens long gone, of hands that fed us before we could feed ourselves, of moments stitched together by the quiet rhythm of stirring, simmering, sharing.

I think that’s why I still find myself, on certain evenings, making my grandmother’s apple tart — not because it’s particularly elegant (the crust is always just slightly too thick, the cinnamon sometimes unevenly sprinkled), but because cutting into that warm slice feels like turning the pages of an old, beloved book. You know every line, yet somehow, it still moves you.

And yes — “,” as you so beautifully called it. Cooking as remembrance. As resurrection. As love made edible.

Thank , for reminding me tonight that some of the finest poetry isn’t written in ink — it’s whispered in steam, stirred into saucepans, and savored one bite at a time.
[A]: 这让我想起一句话：厨房，是记忆的图书馆；而我们，是那群翻找旧信件的读者。

你奶奶的苹果塔，不只是甜点，更像是一页页泛黄的家书。即使饼皮厚了一点、肉桂撒得不匀，那又如何呢？正是这些“不完美”，才让它无法被复制、不可替代。它不是烘焙书上的标准配方，而是属于你一个人的记忆手稿。

我想，这就是为什么我们总在异乡的夜里走进厨房，试图用气味和味道找回某个早已不在的人。我们在灶火中重温他们的声音，在锅铲间听见他们的脚步声慢慢走近。

今晚谢谢你，让我在这杯温热的茶香里，重新看见了食物背后那些看不见的眼睛、那些未说出口的话，还有，那些从未真正离开的爱。
[B]: How profoundly you speak — like a poet who has wandered through the quiet halls of memory and returned with lantern light in hand.

Yes, the kitchen  a library, isn't it? Each recipe a letter filed away in scent and season, waiting to be opened again. And we, its devoted readers, return again and again — not just for nourishment, but for reunion.

I think now of my mother’s tea — nothing extraordinary by any measure: a modest blend, steeped too long, always served with a spoonful of honey she insisted came from a particular Yorkshire heather field. I’m not even sure that field exists… but still, when I brew that same tea late at night, I feel her presence, as if she were sitting across the table, quietly watching me think.

So perhaps that is what cooking truly is — an act of love that lingers beyond absence, a way of saying, .

And tonight, your words have brought me back to her table. Thank you for that gift.
[A]: 你这番话，真像是从心底里泡出来的一壶老茶，温润、深远。

是啊，有些味道，不是为了满足口腹之欲，而是为了让我们在某个不经意的瞬间，重新遇见那些以为已经走远的人。你母亲的那一杯茶，那勺来自“某片不确定是否存在”的石楠花田的蜂蜜，听起来多么像一封写满了温柔谎言的家书——明知是假的，也不愿揭穿，因为那是爱的方式。

我常觉得，人到了一定年纪，味觉就成了一种思念的载体。我们怀念某道菜，不只是因为它好吃，而是因为那道菜背后有一个人、一段时光、一种无法重来的陪伴。

今晚谢谢你，用这么真挚的语言提醒我：厨房不只是做饭的地方，它还是我们与过去对话的角落，是时间慢下来的地方，是心还能回去的故乡。
[B]: You know, there’s a quiet kind of magic in what you’ve said — the way we hold onto people not through photographs or letters, but through scent, taste, and touch. A remembered flavor can be more faithful than memory itself. It doesn’t fade with time; it deepens.

I think now of my students, so often rushing through life, chasing futures they imagine will be grander, fuller… and I want to tell them — . Don’t forget the way your grandmother peeled the potatoes, how your sister always added just a bit more sugar, how your father insisted on toasting the bread just a little darker than everyone else liked. These are the small, sacred things that root us.

And yes, the kitchen is more than walls and shelves and pans — it is a sanctuary where the past is never truly past. Where love simmers gently in the background, waiting to be ladled out in quiet moments.

Thank you, truly, for this conversation. It has been like sharing a long evening by the fire, with only the soft murmur of understanding between two souls who speak the same language — even if it is made mostly of silence, steam, and shared remembrance.
