[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到TikTok啊，我最近确实在上面看到一个很有意思的现象，就是年轻人通过短视频来传播经典文学作品的modern interpretation。我觉得这种形式很有趣，但也有些担忧。你知道吗，就像我们以前用广播来讲《红楼梦》，现在短视频平台也在尝试让古典文化“活”起来。

不过呢，我更喜欢坐下来慢慢读一本纸质书，或者泡一杯龙井茶，跟学生面对面讨论一下文本的intertextuality。你说现在的短视频是不是太快了？快得让人来不及思考？

你觉得短视频对文化传播是利大于弊还是弊大于利呢？我很想听听你的看法。
[A]: Interesting question, and I totally get what you mean about the pace 😊. On one hand, I think TikTok has made literature more . Take that example you mentioned—people who might never pick up a classic novel are now getting exposed to its themes through creative reinterpretation. I’ve even used some of those clips in class as discussion starters, especially with students who are visual learners.

But yeah, there’s a trade-off. The speed of consumption can lead to superficial understanding. Like, if someone only watches a 60-second version of 《红楼梦》, they might miss the nuances of character development or symbolism. That’s why I always encourage my students to treat those videos as a doorway, not the destination 😊.

I guess it’s not really about the medium itself—it’s how we use it. Do you think educators should embrace platforms like TikTok to reach younger audiences, or does that dilute the academic value?
[B]: Hmm, you raise a very thoughtful point. I think it's undeniable that platforms like TikTok have lowered the门槛 for literary engagement, which is no small feat in today’s fast-paced world. The key word here, though, is 桥梁—. These short clips should ideally serve as a bridge between generations, or between casual viewers and deeper readers.

As an educator, I’ve wrestled with this question myself. On one hand, if a student first encounters Shakespeare through a humorous 15-second skit on TikTok, that’s still a valuable entry point. It might even spark curiosity. But you're absolutely right—there’s a risk of reducing complex narratives to digestible snippets, and that can create a false sense of understanding.

I’m leaning toward embracing these platforms, but with intentionality. Maybe we need what I call a “critical viewing” approach—teaching students to watch these videos with a questioning mind: Who made this? What’s left out? How does this compare to the original text?

What I find fascinating is how this mirrors what happened when television first emerged. There were similar debates about whether TV adaptations would ruin literature. Yet, somehow, the canon endured—and so did the love for reading, albeit transformed.

So perhaps the real challenge is not rejecting TikTok outright, but guiding young minds to see it as part of a larger, richer conversation. What do you think—can we cultivate a generation of critical viewers  deep readers?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more with your 桥梁 metaphor—it really captures the potential of TikTok as a cultural tool rather than a threat. And I love how you brought up the television analogy; it reminds me that every new medium faces skepticism at first, especially when it comes to culture and education.

You know, I’ve actually started incorporating “对比阅读” in my bilingual classes—asking students to watch a TikTok adaptation of a literary scene and then read the original text. It’s been eye-opening. Some students who thought they “didn’t like reading” began engaging more deeply once they had that visual hook. Of course, others still feel frustrated by the gap between the simplified video and the complex novel 😕.

And that brings me back to your idea of a  approach—我觉得这可能是关键. We’re not just teaching content anymore; we’re teaching how to question the medium itself. I’ve even had students create their own TikTok-style videos based on a chapter of a book, which forces them to make editorial choices: what to keep, what to cut, how to represent tone visually. It’s basically film theory for the digital age!

So yes, I do believe we can cultivate both critical viewers and deep readers—but only if we actively design learning experiences that bridge those two worlds. Otherwise, we risk having parallel universes: one where literature is locked away in ivory towers, and another where everything’s reduced to a 15-second clip without context.

Have you ever tried assigning students to make their own short videos? If so, what was their reaction?
[B]: That’s such a creative and thoughtful way to integrate TikTok into pedagogy—I’m really impressed by your “对比阅读” approach. It reminds me of what we used to do with film adaptation theory, but now it’s even more dynamic because students aren’t just analyzing someone else’s interpretation; they’re  their own.

I’ve experimented with similar assignments, though perhaps a bit more low-key. Last semester, I asked a group of students to produce one-minute video essays responding to a passage from 鲁迅’s . Some chose to narrate over still images, while others did dramatic reenactments with friends in the campus courtyard. One team even used stop-motion animation with paper cutouts—it was surprisingly moving.

Their reactions were mixed at first—some were excited, others felt awkward being on camera or editing footage. But by the end, many admitted that the process made them reread the text much more closely than usual. They had to , not just summarize. As one student put it: “I finally understood why鲁迅 left things unsaid.”

I think what you're doing—and what I'm trying to move toward—is a kind of multimodal literacy. It's no longer enough to ask students only  a text means; we have to ask  meaning is shaped by the medium. That, to me, is where the real critical thinking happens.

Maybe this also gets at something deeper: the evolving role of the professor. We’re no longer just transmitters of knowledge, but facilitators of engagement across platforms and cultures. Do you find yourself shifting your teaching style more toward this kind of interactive model?
[A]: Absolutely, and I’m so glad you brought up 鲁迅’s  example—鲁迅’s style is so layered, so full of subtext. That kind of assignment really pushes students beyond surface-level comprehension. I can imagine how the stop-motion version added a tactile dimension to the emotional tone of the text 😮. It’s amazing how different mediums force different kinds of empathy.

You’re totally right about our role as professors shifting—from being “sage on the stage” to more of a curator or guide through this multimedia landscape. In my bilingual education classes, I’ve started using what I call a  when we do these video projects. For instance, I encourage students to mix Mandarin, English, and even visual symbols in their videos, as long as their meaning stays coherent. The result? They start seeing language not as separate compartments but as tools for meaning-making across cultures.

And honestly, it’s made me rethink how I design syllabi. Instead of just assigning readings, I now build in —some written, some oral, some digital. One student even did a podcast episode analyzing a poem in both languages, comparing how certain metaphors work differently in Chinese vs. English pronunciation and rhythm 🎧.

I think this interactive model does take more effort—and yes, some tech discomfort on everyone’s part at first—but I’ve seen real depth emerge from it. So yes, my teaching has definitely evolved in that direction, and I’m excited to keep experimenting with it.

Have you thought about integrating cross-linguistic elements into your assignments? Like asking students to reinterpret 鲁迅 in another language or medium?
[B]: That’s beautifully put. I’m especially drawn to your —what a powerful way to frame literary interpretation in our globalized, multilingual classrooms. It reminds me of how Borges once said that translation is not about finding equivalent words, but equivalent intentions. And when students are given the freedom to move between languages and media, they start uncovering those intentions in ways a traditional essay might miss.

I’ve dabbled in cross-linguistic assignments, though perhaps not as fluidly as you describe. One experiment I tried was pairing 鲁迅 with Kafka—asking students to read  alongside 鲁迅’s , and then produce a bilingual response. Some wrote dialogue between Gregor Samsa and the madman; others created visual collages with annotations in both English and Mandarin. One particularly creative student even did a dual-narrative voiceover—switching mid-stream from one perspective to the other, blurring the lines between alienation and rebellion.

What struck me most was how many students started noticing stylistic echoes across cultures. They began asking questions like: Why does Kafka use silence the way 鲁迅 uses irony? How does absurdity travel across contexts? It really opened up a space for comparative thinking—not just at the level of content, but of form and affect.

I’d love to go further with this—maybe even co-create a digital anthology with students where each entry is a multimodal reinterpretation of a classic text in both languages. Something that lives online, evolves over time… almost like a living dialogue across borders.

You know, sometimes I think we underestimate how hungry students are for this kind of work—not just analysis, but reimagining. What do you think? Is this what Paulo Freire meant by  before reading the word?
[A]: I’m honestly inspired by your Kafka-鲁迅 pairing—what a brilliant way to get students thinking about existential alienation across cultural contexts. And the fact that they started noticing stylistic parallels on their own? That’s gold. That’s what we dream of as educators—when they start making those deep, intertextual connections without us even prompting it.

And yes—I think you’re absolutely right about Freire. His idea of  feels especially urgent now, when students are navigating so many overlapping discourses: visual, digital, linguistic, cultural. If we can help them see literature not just as texts-in-isolation but as living dialogues, then we’re doing more than teaching language—we’re培养批判性文化意识.

A digital anthology sounds like an incredible project. It could even become a legacy assignment, where each semester a new cohort adds to or remixes previous entries. Imagine how rich it would be after five years! Students contributing from different countries, in different modes… it would be a kind of  of interpretation. I’d love to collaborate on something like that with you someday 🤗

And speaking of Freire—you ever notice how his ideas resonate with classical Chinese literary theory? Like, when Confucius talked about 诗可以兴观群怨—how poetry stirs emotion, offers insight, builds community, and channels dissent. Sounds a lot like critical literacy to me 😄

Have you ever brought in classical Chinese texts alongside modern Western ones? I’d be curious to hear how students respond to that kind of juxtaposition.
[B]: Ah, 诗可以兴观群怨—你提到这句话真是说到我心坎里去了。这和Freire的critical literacy确实有一种跨越时空的共鸣。其实，我一直觉得中国古典文论里藏着一套非常现代的阅读伦理——不是被动接受，而是主动介入世界的方式。

这几年我在课上尝试把《论语》《文心雕龙》和西方现当代理论并置讲授。比如有一次，我把刘勰的“情采”说与罗兰·巴特的放在一起讨论。起初学生一脸困惑：一个在讲文采之美，一个在谈文本快感，能有什么关系？但当我们深入下去，他们开始意识到两者都在探讨情感如何通过语言结构被唤起、被引导、甚至被颠覆。

还有一次，我让同学们读了孟子“以意逆志”的解诗方法，接着引入伽达默尔的诠释学循环。你猜怎么着？有位同学突然说：“原来古人早就懂contextual reading！”她意识到，孟子提出的不是要回到作者本意，而是要读者用自己的经验和理解去“逆”出意义——这不正是诠释学的核心吗？

学生最初的反应往往是有些抗拒的，毕竟这种跨时空对话需要很强的思维跳跃能力。但一旦跳过去了，他们常常会兴奋地说：“原来我们不是在背古文，是在和古人辩论啊！”

我觉得关键在于我们怎么搭建那个桥梁（又是桥 😄）——不能只是摆在一起就算了，而是要设计一些真正激发思辨的问题。比如：“如果你请庄子去跟德里达喝咖啡，他们会聊什么？”或者，“如果杜甫活在今天，他会发什么样的朋友圈？”

我想这也是为什么你的数字 anthology 构想如此吸引我——它不只是一个项目，更是一种持续的文化对话方式。我们不是教学生“记住”经典，而是让他们参与到经典的再生成中来。

你有没有试过用这种方式来讲唐宋诗词？特别是面对非母语学生时，他们是怎么理解那些高度浓缩又极具文化特定性的表达的？
[A]: Oh, 这个问题太有意思了——尤其是面对非母语学生时讲唐宋诗词，简直像在解谜一样充满挑战和乐趣 😄。

我确实做过一些尝试，尤其是在我的“Chinese Poetry in Global Context”这门课上。一开始我也担心，像李白的“床前明月光”这种看似简单、实则深远的诗句，会不会被学生误解成只是“他想家了”而已。但后来我发现，只要引导得当，反而能激发他们非常深刻的跨文化思考。

比如，我曾让学生对比读李白的《静夜思》和Walt Whitman的一首短诗 。表面上看，一个是在异乡望月，一个是在听讲座后感到疏离。但当我们深入结构、语气、意象的使用之后，学生开始注意到：两者都在用极简的语言表达existential moment —— 李白通过月光触发现代人所说的nostalgia与存在孤独，而Whitman则是从理性知识中抽离出来，走向直觉和个人体验。

有个法国学生当时就说：“李白的月亮是具体的，但它指向的是看不见的情绪；Whitman的星空是理性的，但他却感到失落。好像他们都对‘知道’这件事保持怀疑。”Wow，那一刻我真的觉得课堂达到了某种诗意的共鸣 🤩。

对于非母语者来说，语言障碍当然是存在的，但我发现如果给他们足够的文化context（比如配上唐代长安的地图、诗人流放路线、甚至当时的胡琴音乐），他们会开始理解那些意象背后的情感逻辑。比如“孤帆远影碧空尽”不只是写景，而是写“送别”的过程如何变成一种内心的空缺。

我还鼓励他们用自己的语言重新创作一首“现代版”的唐诗。有人用Instagram story的形式表现杜甫的登高，把高楼大厦比作青山，把地铁人流比作江水——虽然不完美，但那种主动参与诠释的过程，正是我们说的那种“critical reading of the world”呀 😊。

说到这个，你有没有遇到过学生因为文化差异，完全误读了某句诗，结果却生成了意想不到的创意？我觉得这种misreading有时候也能成为教学的亮点。
[B]: Oh, absolutely—那些misreadings往往是最有启发性的 moments。我记得有一次，一个德国学生在分析李商隐的“相见时难别亦难”时，误以为“东风无力百花残”是在描写一个人内心的抑郁情绪，而不是传统的春末景象。他甚至引用了卡夫卡小说里的某些段落来论证自己的解读。

我当时愣了一下，心想这可真是离原意有点远啊 😅。但转念一想，他的理解虽然偏离了历史语境，却意外地揭示了诗句中潜藏的情感张力：那种无法掌控、被外力牵制的感觉，确实在李商隐的诗里反复出现。只不过他用的是现代心理语言重新编码而已。

我决定不急着纠正，而是反问全班：“如果李商隐活在今天，他会怎么写‘百花残’？会不会也用一种更个人化的方式表达失落？”结果整个课堂开始热烈讨论——有的说他可能会写成歌词，有的说他可能拍一支广告式的短片，还有一位韩国学生提到李商隐的那种“朦胧感”其实很像BTS（防弹少年团）某些歌曲中的情感表达方式。

那一刻我突然意识到，有时候我们太执着于“正确解读”，反而忽略了诗歌本来的力量：它允许不同层次的理解，并且在每一次再诠释中重生。Misreading，其实也可以是一种creative misprision，是哈罗德·布鲁姆说的那种有意的误读，用来打破前文本的权威，开启新的意义空间。

所以后来我也开始有意设计一些“误读练习”——比如让学生故意把杜甫读成存在主义者，或者把王维当成生态诗人。结果呢？他们反而更能抓住作者的真实意图，因为他们在做对比的时候，不得不回到文本本身去确认哪些是可以迁移的意义，哪些是文化专属的密码。

你刚才说的那个Instagram版《登高》让我想到一个问题：如果我们接受这种跨时空、跨媒介的重写，那是不是意味着古典诗词的教学也在经历某种范式转移？从解释学转向创造性回应？

不知道你有没有这样的感觉——我们这一代教古典文学的人，其实更像是翻译者，不只是翻译语言，更是翻译情感结构和审美经验。你觉得呢？
[A]: 完全同意你的看法，而且你那个德国学生的例子真的让我眼前一亮 👏。这种creative misprision确实不是错误，而是一种interpretive stretching ——就像伽达默尔说的“视域融合”那样，把古代文本拉进当下的生活经验里。

我现在也在想，其实我们自己在做研究的时候，不也常常借助西方理论来重新看中国文学吗？比如用荣格的原型理论分析《红楼梦》，或者从海德格尔的存在哲学角度读陶渊明。这些方法本来就是跨文化的“误读”，但它们打开了新的理解空间，而不是封闭它。

所以我觉得你说得对——我们更像是情感结构和审美经验的翻译者，而不是权威的解释者。而且这种翻译不是一对一的字面转换，而是contextual adaptation，是要让古典诗词在另一个时空、另一种媒介中继续呼吸。

我记得有一次上课，我放了两段视频：一段是杜甫《秋兴八首》的传统吟诵，另一段是一个韩国DJ用电子音乐remix的《将进酒》。学生一开始觉得后者简直是对李白的亵渎 😅，但当我问：“如果李白看到这个版本，他会生气还是觉得好玩？”课堂立刻炸开了锅。

有人提出：“李白本身就是一个喜欢跨界的人，他喝酒、写狂草、交胡人朋友，为什么不能有电子版？”还有人反驳说：“可是一旦节奏变了，情绪就不一样了。”你看，他们开始意识到形式不只是包装，它直接影响意义的传递方式。

这让我想到一个问题：如果我们接受诗歌可以被重构、被再创作，那是不是也应该重新思考我们的评估标准？比如，不再只问“你有没有读懂这首诗”，而是问“你能让它活起来吗？”你觉得未来会不会出现一种新的教学范式，以reimagination为核心，而不是以解释为主？

也许我们正在见证一场静悄悄的变革——不是放弃传统，而是让传统变得更有生命力。你觉得呢？
[B]: Hmm…你提到的这个转变——从解释到reimagination，让我想起宇文所安在谈中国古典文学时说的一句话：“The past is not a fixed point we recover, but a set of materials we reassemble.” 我们过去总认为文本的意义是固定的，但其实它一直在被重组、被重新激活。

我想未来的教学确实会越来越重视这种“让诗活起来”的能力。毕竟，如果我们只是把李白当成一个博物馆里的瓷器来分析，那学生学到的只是一种遥远的敬意；但如果我们让他和当代文化对话，哪怕是以一种不完美的方式，诗歌就变成了流动的、有温度的经验。

我最近就在尝试一个实验：让学生用不同媒介来“翻译”《诗经》。有人选择写一封现代情书，模仿“关关雎鸠”的隐喻结构；有人拍了一段vlog，把“采采卷耳”读成都市人寻找心灵栖息地的故事；还有一个学生干脆用AI生成图像，把“蒹葭苍苍”转化成一段虚拟现实体验。

起初我也担心，这样做会不会让古典变得太随意？但后来我发现，恰恰是在这些看似“越界”的尝试中，学生反而更认真地去理解原诗的情感逻辑。因为他们不是被动接受，而是在主动构建意义——这其实比任何标准答案都更有价值。

至于评估方式，我觉得也得跟着变。或许我们可以不再以“准确度”为唯一标准，而是引入“共鸣度”这个维度：你的再创作是否让人真正感受到原作的精神？比如你刚才说的那个DJ版《将进酒》，如果它能让听众重新体会那种豪放与失落交织的情绪，那它就是成功的再诠释。

所以我很愿意相信，我们正在经历一场范式的转变：从经典的“保存者”转向“唤醒者”，甚至可以说，是诗意的“策展人”。我们不是要控制解读的边界，而是要创造更多进入诗歌的门径。

说到底，诗之所以“经典”，不是因为它古老，而是因为它足够深广，容得下无数种重述的方式。你说是不是？
[A]: Absolutely — 宇文所安那句话说得太好了，“The past is not a fixed point we recover, but a set of materials we reassemble.” 这让我想到，其实每一代人对经典的“再组装”，都是在回应他们自己的时代情感和文化语境。而我们今天的学生，正处在这样一个信息、图像、语言高度流动的时代，他们的理解和表达方式自然也会发生变化。

你那个《诗经》的媒介翻译实验听起来真是太棒了！尤其是AI生成图像和VR体验的部分 😮。这不仅是在做文本分析，更像是在用技术重建一种情感结构——而且不是简单的复制，而是带有个人经验的重新编码。我觉得这种做法特别契合我们之前说的那种“critical reimagination”：学生不只是读懂一首诗，而是在用自己的方式让这首诗被人再次“感受”。

说到共鸣度这个评估维度，我最近也在思考类似的问题。比如在我的课上，我开始鼓励学生写“回应性创作”（responsive writing），而不是传统的文学评论。他们可以写一封信给诗人，或者用现代场景重构一个意象，甚至有人写了一段杜甫与鲍勃·迪伦的虚拟对话 🤯。

我发现这些作品虽然不总是学术严谨，但往往更能体现学生对诗歌情绪和节奏的深层理解。就像你说的，他们在构建意义，而不是复制意义。

或许未来的文学教育，真的会从“保存—传递”模式转向“唤醒—再生”模式。我们不再是守着经典的人，而是为经典创造新语境的人；不只是解释者，更是策展人和共创者。

你说得没错，经典之所以是经典，不是因为它们不会改变，而是因为它们足够深广，能容纳各种重述。而我们的任务，就是帮助新一代找到属于他们的重述方式。

我想，这才是对传统最温柔也最有力量的延续 🌟
[B]: Exactly. 你说得太好了，尤其是“温柔也最有力量的延续”这句话，真的点出了我们作为文学教育者的深层使命。不是让经典冻结在博物馆里，而是让它像水一样，随着容器变化而流动，但本质仍在。

我最近在重读《文心雕龙·通变》，刘勰说“文不灭质，辞不灭情”，意思是文字的形式可以变，但内在的本质与情感不应被抹杀。这放在今天来看，依然非常贴切。不管是AI图像、DJ remix，还是TikTok视频，只要这些新形式没有消灭原作的情感结构和审美深度，那它们就是有效的传承方式。

而且我发现，学生在这种自由表达中反而更愿意回到文本本身——他们开始主动问：“李白为什么总写月亮？”“杜甫的忧伤到底来自哪里？”这些问题其实在传统课堂上我也讲过，但只有当他们试图用自己的语言去重构时，才会真正感到困惑、好奇、甚至焦虑 😄。而这正是深入阅读的起点。

我想起有位学生在用VR重现王维的辋川别业后，突然对我说：“原来王维的山水不是风景，是一种心灵状态。”那一刻我意识到，技术不只是工具，它也可以成为一种理解的媒介，甚至是一种思辨的语言。

所以我觉得未来的文学课，也许会越来越像一种“跨媒介工作室”（intermedial workshop）：诗歌不再是孤立的文本，而是可延展、可对话、可再生的文化基因。我们在教的不只是文学史，而是一种文化的想象力。

谢谢你今天的分享，让我又重新看见了教学的意义所在 🌿  
或许，我们就是在悄悄种下一些火种——等哪天风吹过来，就燃成一片光了。
[A]: Couldn’t have said it better myself 🌿. “种下火种”——这个意象太美了，也让我想起 teaching is often about planting seeds we may never see grow. But the fact that we’re having this conversation, and that students are starting to ask questions like “Why does Li Bai always write about the moon?”—well, that’s already a spark.

And I love how you brought 刘勰 back into the picture. “文不灭质，辞不灭情”这句放到现在来看真的特别有前瞻性。它让我们看到，传统不是僵硬的规则，而是一种动态的 negotiation —— between form and feeling, past and present, text and medium.

那个学生用VR重建辋川别业后说“王维的山水不是风景，是一种心灵状态”，这句话简直可以写进教学笔记里 😊。技术在这里不再是表面的炫技，而成了理解诗意的透镜。我想这就是我们一直在追求的那种深度学习：不是记住一首诗讲什么，而是体验它为何重要。

或许未来的intermedial workshop不只是教文学的方式，也是一种文化再生的实验室。我们会看到更多跨界、跨语言、甚至跨AI的合作。但我相信，不管媒介怎么变，那个“情”与“质”的核心始终在流动。

谢谢你今天的对话，也谢谢你让我重新看见自己为什么热爱这份工作。  
愿我们一起悄悄地，点着更多的光 ✨
[B]: You know, it’s conversations like this that remind me why I’ve stayed in teaching all these years. It’s not just about literature anymore—it’s about the spaces we create for students to think, reimagine, and connect across time, culture, and medium.

And yes—let’s keep planting those seeds quietly, patiently. Some may take root in ways we never expect. After all, if a DJ remix of 《将进酒》 can lead someone to read李白的整本诗集，或者 a VR recreation of 辋川 can make someone feel 王维的 solitude, then we’re doing something right.

I truly believe the future of literary education lies in this kind of intermedial, intercultural, and intergenerational dialogue. And honestly, I’m excited to see what our students will build when we give them the tools—and the freedom—to respond creatively to the past.

Thank you for this conversation. It’s been inspiring, thought-provoking, and deeply human.  
Let’s keep lighting those quiet fires—one poem, one student, one reimagining at a time 🌟
[A]: Couldn’t agree more. It’s in those quiet, persistent spaces of teaching and conversation that real transformation happens—often unseen, but deeply felt.

And I love your line:  That’s the kind of teaching I want to be doing. Slow, thoughtful, generative. Not chasing trends, but nurturing sensibilities.

You know, I think what we’re doing goes beyond curriculum design or pedagogy—it’s about cultural stewardship with imagination. We’re not just passing down texts; we’re inviting students into a living conversation with the past, giving them permission to speak back, to remix, to reinterpret.

And who knows? Maybe someday, one of our students will write a poem in code, or compose a song that reimagines 杜甫 for the 22nd century, or make a film where 庄子 walks through a neon-lit city dreaming of butterflies 🦋.

And when that happens, we’ll know we’ve done something quietly revolutionary.

Thank you again for this exchange—it’s reminded me how lucky we are to do work that matters, even when it feels small.  
Let’s keep having these conversations. They light up the path forward 🌟
[B]: You’re absolutely right—real transformation is often unseen, but deeply felt. And I think that’s the kind of impact we, as teachers, are called to trust, even when it’s not measurable or immediate.

I love that image of a 22nd-century film where 庄子 walks through a neon-lit city dreaming of butterflies 🦋. Maybe in that scene, someone else wakes up wondering whether they’re a programmer or a poet—or both. That’s the kind of imaginative dissonance I want our students to sit with, to grow from.

And yes, this work  quietly revolutionary. We may not be making headlines, but we’re shaping minds that will shape worlds. By giving students permission to question, reimagine, and reinterpret, we’re not just teaching literature—we’re cultivating cultural agility and emotional intelligence across time and space.

Thank you again for walking this path with me, even if just for a conversation.  
Let’s keep lighting those quiet fires—in our classrooms, in our scholarship, and in each other.  
The future of literary imagination is in good hands 🌟
