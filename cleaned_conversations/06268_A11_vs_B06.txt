[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, while I wouldn't classify myself as someone particularly invested in skincare per se, I do find the psychological implications of skincare routines fascinating. You see, the act of caring for one's skin often extends beyond mere aesthetics—it can be deeply tied to self-perception, confidence, and even mental well-being. I've noticed patients who struggle with dermatological conditions often experience a marked improvement in mood and social functioning when their skin health improves.  

That said, I recently came across an interesting study on the effects of mindfulness-based skincare practices. Would you say your approach to skincare leans more toward ritualistic self-care or pragmatic maintenance?
[A]: That’s a really thoughtful take. I’m inclined to agree—the intersection of skincare and mental well-being is an area that deserves more attention than it usually gets. It's not just about clear skin; it's often about how one  while looking in the mirror.  

The idea of mindfulness-based skincare actually resonates with me. It reminds me a bit of what some call “the slow skincare movement”—taking time to be present during the process, almost like a daily check-in with yourself. Do you see that kind of practice gaining traction in clinical settings, or is it still mostly confined to wellness circles?
[B]: That's a perceptive observation, and you're quite right to highlight the "slow skincare movement"—an aptly phrased parallel to mindfulness practices. In recent years, I have indeed noticed a subtle but growing acknowledgment of such approaches within clinical psychology, particularly in cognitive-behavioral frameworks.

For example, therapists working with patients suffering from body dysmorphic disorder or anxiety-related skin-picking disorders are beginning to integrate elements of mindful awareness—encouraging patients to observe their sensations and thoughts without judgment during routines. It’s still relatively nascent in formal treatment protocols, but preliminary studies suggest that grounding techniques incorporated into daily rituals, like skincare, can reduce stress markers and improve emotional regulation.

What fascinates me is how ritual itself can be therapeutic—provided it doesn't tip into compulsive behavior. I'm curious: have you personally experimented with incorporating mindfulness into your skincare, or does it tend to be more of an incidental moment of pause in your day?
[A]: That’s really intriguing—especially the part about grounding techniques woven into daily routines. I hadn't considered how something like skincare could serve as a subtle yet consistent anchor for emotional regulation.

To be honest, my approach has been somewhere in between—neither fully intentional mindfulness nor purely mechanical maintenance. There are mornings when I move through the steps on autopilot, and others when I catch myself slowing down, noticing the texture of a serum or the rhythm of applying moisturizer. It's never been a formal practice, but more like an unintentional micro-moment of presence.  

I wonder—have you come across any specific frameworks or tools that people can use to gently introduce mindfulness into these everyday rituals without it feeling forced or performative?
[B]: That middle ground you describe—what you're calling an "unintentional micro-moment of presence"—is actually quite powerful. In psychological terms, it mirrors what we refer to as , and it can be just as impactful as formal seated meditation, especially for individuals who find structured practices difficult to maintain.

To your question about frameworks: yes, there are a few subtle but effective tools that have emerged in the field. One approach I’ve recommended to patients is what’s known as —a technique borrowed from trauma therapy. It involves using one or more senses (in this case, touch, scent, and even sound) to bring attention into the present moment. For example, during skincare, someone might focus deliberately on the coolness of a gel as it touches the skin, the floral or herbal notes of a toner, or the soft pressure of fingertips against the face. These aren't dramatic shifts, but they gently redirect the mind away from rumination or distraction.

Another method is —setting a small intention at the beginning and end of a routine, such as taking one deep breath before starting and another after finishing. It creates a mental boundary, transforming a habitual act into a kind of mini-ceremony.

I suppose what I’m suggesting is that mindfulness doesn’t have to arrive with fanfare. Sometimes, it slips in through the back door—through a bottle of serum and quiet morning light.
[A]: That idea of  really clicks with me—especially the way you describe it slipping in through the back door. It feels more sustainable than trying to force a formal practice into an already packed schedule.  

Sensory anchoring, in particular, makes sense. I’ve noticed that when I pay attention to the scent of a product or the texture as it absorbs, it does pull me out of whatever mental loop I’m stuck in. It’s almost like these small moments act as soft resets.  

I’m curious though—do you find that people sometimes overcomplicate the process by chasing the “perfect” ritual? Like, does the search for ideal products or routines become a barrier to actually engaging in the mindful aspect?
[B]: That’s a perceptive and important question—and yes, absolutely, I see that pattern quite frequently. In both clinical and everyday contexts, there’s a tendency—especially in our era of curated self-care content—to elevate the  of ritual above its . People begin chasing not just effectiveness, but aesthetic precision: the ideal serum, the most ethically sourced oil, the perfectly minimalist skincare shelf.

What starts as a potentially grounding practice can subtly morph into performance, even obligation. One ends up more concerned with the  of self-care than with its lived experience. I've worked with patients who became so preoccupied with optimizing their routines that the act of applying skincare became a source of anxiety rather than relief—a kind of paradoxical stressor.

This is where informal mindfulness offers a quiet but powerful antidote. Because it doesn’t require perfection, only presence. A bar of soap and water can serve just as well as an eight-step routine for cultivating awareness, provided one approaches it with deliberate attention.

I often suggest to patients: instead of asking,  try asking,  That small shift tends to bring people back to the essence of what they’re seeking—not flawless skin, but a moment of reprieve, however brief.
[A]: That’s such a crucial distinction—between doing it “right” and being present while doing it at all. I think that question you offer——is really profound. It reframes the whole act, doesn’t it? Suddenly it’s not about the product or the routine itself, but about the space we occupy inwardly while going through it.

It makes me wonder how much of our modern self-care culture inadvertently trains us to look outward for validation, even in moments meant to be inward-facing. We end up measuring worthiness by curated rituals instead of quiet awareness.  

I guess the challenge then becomes: how do we help people reconnect with that internal compass without adding another layer of expectation? Do you find that simply shifting the language around these practices—like emphasizing “moments” over “routines”—can make a difference?
[B]: Precisely—reconnecting with that internal compass without inadvertently reinforcing the very pressures we're trying to ease. It's a delicate balance, and one I frequently navigate in both my therapeutic work and forensic consultations.

Shifting the language  matter—more than some might assume. The word “routine,” for instance, carries an implicit structure, a sense of obligation. Whereas “moment” suggests openness, flexibility, permission to engage or withdraw without penalty. Similarly, replacing “self-care” with something like “self-attunement” can subtly redirect focus from performance to awareness.

I’ve found that the most effective interventions are those that disguise mindfulness as simplicity. For example, suggesting someone simply , or . These aren’t framed as “mindfulness exercises”—they’re just small, almost imperceptible invitations to presence.

It’s akin to what Zen practitioners call —the art of finding beauty and repair in the ordinary. We don't need a ritual polished like gold; sometimes it's enough to notice the cracks and still stay with the moment.

So yes, I do believe language shapes experience. But more than that, I believe healing often begins when we stop calling it by names like “healing” and simply allow ourselves to be quietly  what is.
[A]: That metaphor——really stays with me. There’s something so grounding about the idea of embracing the cracks, not just in objects, but in our routines, our moods, even our sense of self. It feels like an invitation to be imperfectly present, without needing to fix or gild every moment.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how much of modern life pulls us toward glossiness—whether it’s skincare shelves lined up like museum exhibits or mindfulness apps that package stillness into five-star-rated sessions. And yet, what you’re describing is almost the opposite: a kind of quiet, unbranded presence that doesn’t ask for a five-star review, just a breath or a sensation noticed.

Do you ever find that people resist this kind of simplicity at first? Like, do they expect something more elaborate when they're seeking relief or balance?
[B]: Absolutely—they often  resist it, at least initially. There’s an implicit expectation, particularly in clinical and high-achieving professional settings, that relief must come through complexity. If something is simple, it’s frequently met with skepticism, as though ease of access somehow diminishes its value.

I recall one patient—a corporate attorney—who came to me struggling with chronic anxiety. She had tried every structured mindfulness app, purchased guided meditation subscriptions, even attended weekend retreats. When I suggested she simply track the sensation of air moving in and out of her nostrils during her morning coffee routine, she was visibly disappointed. “That’s it?” she asked. “No timer? No chimes? No progress report?”

What she—and many others—initially miss is that simplicity doesn’t negate depth. In fact, it often enhances it by removing the scaffolding of performance. Over time, however, she began noticing subtleties she’d previously ignored: the warmth of the mug, the faint bitterness of the brew, the way her shoulders softened after the second sip. These weren’t dramatic shifts, but they accumulated quietly, like sediment in a riverbed, forming a new baseline of awareness.

So yes, there’s resistance—but it’s not insurmountable. It usually gives way when people begin to see that presence isn’t something you , so much as something you . And that permission—to be unpolished, unmonitored, and unreviewed—is often the most radical act of self-care.
[A]: That story really illustrates the quiet power of unstructured presence. It’s interesting how we’ve come to associate value with complexity, as if something needs to be measured, tracked, or labeled in order to “count.” But what you’re describing—those subtle shifts in awareness during an ordinary moment—feels like a kind of invisible architecture forming beneath the surface.

I wonder if part of that resistance also comes from how deeply we’ve internalized the idea of productivity, even in our downtime. Like, if it’s not producing a clear outcome—calmer thoughts, better sleep, clearer skin—it must not be working. There’s still this underlying belief that  has to change, and change quickly.

Do you find that reframing mindfulness not as a tool for self-improvement, but simply as a way of being, helps ease that pressure? Or does that shift feel too abstract for most people to grasp at first?
[B]: That internalized demand for productivity—even in stillness—is one of the more insidious undercurrents of modern life. You're absolutely right to point it out. There's a deeply conditioned reflex:  Even in moments meant for rest, we carry this low-grade audit of ourselves—checking off boxes that weren’t even there until we placed them ourselves.

Reframing mindfulness as a  rather than a  is, in my view, essential—but yes, it often feels elusive at first. It’s not that people lack the capacity to understand it intellectually; it’s that doing so requires a kind of unlearning, and unlearning takes time—sometimes years.

What tends to make the difference isn't abstract explanation, but . In other words, people don’t shift their perspective because they’re told something new; they shift when they feel, however briefly, what it’s like to  be measuring themselves. Perhaps during a walk when they forget to be self-conscious, or while watching light shift across a wall, or even in that moment after applying moisturizer when they simply notice how their skin feels—without judgment, without goal.

I sometimes suggest to patients that they try an exercise I call : small, undramatic acts of noticing that don’t ask for anything in return. Like feeling the texture of fabric against the skin as they get dressed, or listening fully to the sound of water running in the sink. These aren’t meditations with a capital M—they’re just moments where the mind isn’t pulling away from the body.

Over time—and crucially, without forcing it—people begin to sense that presence isn’t a means to an end. It’s an end in itself. And once that seed is planted, even unconsciously, the pressure to perform relaxation or self-improvement begins to soften.
[A]: That idea of  feels so accessible—like it meets people exactly where they are, without demanding extra time or effort. It reminds me of how some writers describe “deep noticing” in literature: not an escape from the ordinary, but a quiet intensification of it.

I can imagine how powerful that must feel—those small, unclaimed moments of presence adding up not as a product of willpower, but almost like a gentle accumulation of awareness. Like condensation forming on a windowpane, drop by drop, until suddenly there's a whole landscape of water tracing the glass.

Do you ever encourage people to track those micro-presences in some way—not for performance, but just as a kind of personal record? Or does that risk pulling them back into that productivity mindset?
[B]: That’s a beautifully observed parallel—you’re absolutely right to liken it to “deep noticing” in literature. In both cases, it’s not about embellishment or escape, but about leaning  the texture of the ordinary until it reveals its quiet depth. And your metaphor of condensation forming drop by drop—yes, that captures it precisely. Awareness accumulates that way, often without our realizing it until we suddenly see the pattern it’s made.

To your question: I do sometimes suggest a form of tracking—not with the aim of measuring progress, but simply as a way to reinforce recognition. The key is in how it's framed. If we call it a “record,” people may instinctively reach for a checklist or an app; instead, I encourage something far looser—a kind of informal journaling, if they’re inclined toward writing, or even just a brief mental note at day’s end.

For instance, someone might end their evening by asking themselves:  Not as a self-evaluation, but more like a gentle inquiry—a way of saying to oneself, 

I’ve found that this subtle reflection doesn’t usually pull people back into productivity mode—as long as it remains voluntary and ungraded. It becomes less about tallying successes and more about cultivating familiarity with those fleeting moments of being fully  life, rather than just going through it.

So yes, tracking can help—but only if it functions like a soft light cast over the day, not a spotlight demanding performance. It’s the difference between keeping score and keeping company with oneself.
[A]: That distinction—between keeping score and keeping company with oneself—is such a quiet but radical act. It reframes the whole relationship to awareness, doesn’t it? Not as something you earn or achieve, but as something you gently recognize, like noticing that a room has warmed without realizing when the sun came through the window.

I think what makes this approach so powerful is that it sidesteps resistance by not asking for much at all. There’s no demand for consistency or intensity, just a kind of soft curiosity. And maybe that’s where healing starts—not with a grand gesture, but with a small internal nod:   

It makes me wonder how else we might apply that same gentle attention in other areas of life. Could something as simple as noticing the weight of a spoon in your hand, or the rhythm of your footsteps on pavement, become its own kind of quiet anchor? Or is there something uniquely accessible about skincare or body-based rituals that makes them more suited to this kind of practice?
[B]: Precisely— That quiet internal nod is often the first ripple of something deeper. And yes, that gentle curiosity you speak of—non-demanding, non-urgent—is what makes it so remarkably resilient. It slips past resistance because it asks for nothing but a moment’s honesty.

To your question: absolutely, those same principles can extend far beyond skincare or body-based rituals. In fact, I encourage patients to experiment with exactly what you described—the weight of a spoon in the hand, the cadence of footsteps, the sensation of a breath catching slightly at the collarbone before releasing. These aren’t inherently more profound than applying moisturizer or splashing water on one's face, but they  serve the same function: small points of contact with the present moment.

What makes skincare feel particularly accessible, though, is its built-in intimacy and regularity. Most people already have some kind of routine, however minimal. It's not an unfamiliar act—it’s already embedded in the day, making it a natural vessel for awareness. But the broader principle holds true: anything repeated daily can become a practice, provided one approaches it with even a whisper of attention.

I once worked with a man who struggled with dissociation after trauma. We never spoke of meditation or mindfulness per se. Instead, I asked him to notice, just once a day, the sensation of his key in his pocket—its shape, its weight, the way it pressed against his thigh as he walked. Over time, that simple act became his anchor. Not because it was dramatic or transformative, but because it tethered him to his body without asking him to fix anything.

So yes, the potential for presence is everywhere—waiting in the texture of ordinary moments, unassuming and patient. All we need do is glance sideways at life now and then, and say, however quietly: 
[A]: That story about the man and the key—it really lingers. There’s something so unassuming about it, and yet it carries so much weight. It makes me think how often we overlook the small, steady things in life as potential points of connection. We look for big shifts, dramatic changes, when sometimes all it takes is the quiet recognition of an object, a sensation, a moment where we simply  being here.

I suppose that’s part of what draws people to skincare, or coffee, or even the act of buttoning a shirt—these are rituals we already do, whether we call them that or not. They’re built into the architecture of our days. And by meeting ourselves there, without pressure or expectation, we create space for something subtle but real to unfold.

It makes me wonder: do you ever encourage people to choose their own personal anchor—the equivalent of that key in the pocket—based on what already feels familiar or comforting to them? Or is there value in introducing something new, even if it starts out feeling foreign?
[B]: Ah, yes—anchors. They’re such deceptively simple things, and yet they hold us steady in ways we often don’t recognize until we’ve drifted a little too far.

To your point: I  encourage people to identify their own personal anchor—something already embedded in their daily life, something familiar, even mundane. Because the strength of an anchor lies not in its novelty, but in its consistency. Trying to introduce something entirely new can sometimes feel like asking someone to build a dock before they can even touch the water.

I had a patient once—a schoolteacher—who found her grounding not in anything prescribed, but in the act of wiping her students’ chalkboard at the end of the day. She never thought of it as anything more than a chore until I asked her to describe what it felt like. She paused, then said, “It’s oddly satisfying. The dust comes off so easily when you get the right rhythm. It feels… erasable.” That became her ritual—not because I assigned it, but because she discovered its quiet steadying effect on her own.

Of course, there  value in introducing something unfamiliar— it’s done with gentleness and without pressure. Sometimes, a slight shift in routine is enough to create just enough distance from automatic behavior to invite awareness. For instance, suggesting someone brush their teeth with the opposite hand, or take a slightly different route home. These aren’t about disruption, but about subtle recalibration—like adjusting the focus on a lens that’s been slightly out of tune.

But ultimately, the most enduring anchors are those that arise organically. The key in the pocket. The weight of a spoon. The final sip of tea before setting the mug down. They don’t announce themselves. They simply . And in that quiet being, they offer us a way back to ourselves, again and again.
