[A]: Hey，关于'你平时用小红书还是Instagram比较多？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the modern dilemma of digital parchment versus illuminated manuscripts... Though I must confess my engagement with such platforms is rather like Keats' nightingale - heard but seldom seen. My students insist I should 'curate an aesthetic,' whatever that means.
[A]: 哈哈，Dr. Carter你这种literary比喻真是绝了！不过说真的，我连朋友圈都很少发，更别说这些social media platforms了。我的digital footprint大概只存在于GitHub commits里吧 😅 

(突然兴奋地推了推眼镜) 不过从computational linguistics的角度来看，小红书和Instagram的language patterns倒是fascinating的研究对象！比如emoji使用频率和code-switching现象...
[B]: My dear, you've touched upon something quite profound - the evolution of digital vernacular is indeed the new 'Canterbury Tales' of our age. Though I must correct you, it's Dr. Whitmore, not Carter.  

The juxtaposition of emoji and code-switching reminds me of how Browning would slip Italian phrases into his verse - though I doubt he'd approve of the eggplant emoji's modern connotations.
[A]: Oops！My sincere apologies for the name mix-up, Dr. Whitmore  🤦‍♂️ 您说得太对了，emoji确实像是21世纪的digital hieroglyphics！ 

(突然激动地掏出笔记本) 说到Browning，您有没有注意到modern social media discourse里那种dramatic monologue的变体？比如小红书上的"今天又被闺蜜betray了..."这种narrative structure简直就像当代的"My Last Duchess"啊！
[B]: Ah! Now you're speaking my language.  Those performative lamentations are indeed the dramatic monologues of the Instagram age - though with considerably less subtlety than Browning's Duke. 

I recently came across a particularly florid Yelp review that could give Tennyson's 'Lockshade' a run for its money. The way modern grievances are crafted... it's almost poetic, in a rather tragicomical sense.
[A]: OMG您这个Yelp review的observation太brilliant了！💡 这让我想到我们lab最近在做的一个sentiment analysis project - 那些angry reviews的linguistic features简直比Shakespearean insults还有创意！"这个avocado toast比我的ex还要disappointing"之类的 🤣 

(突然正经起来) 不过说真的，从corpus linguistics角度看，这种digital discourse的emotional intensity确实值得研究...也许我们可以写篇paper？📝
[B]: How delightfully morbid!  

You've essentially proposed documenting the death throes of civilized discourse - what a splendidly dark academic pursuit. Though I must insist we approach it with proper Victorian decorum. Perhaps title it 'The Anatomy of Digital Melodrama: From Byron to Burger King Complaints'? 

Now, shall we include a comparative analysis of Twitter feuds versus 18th-century pamphlet wars? 
[A]: 哈哈哈Dr. Whitmore您这个title简直perfect！✨ 我连abstract都脑补出来了："本研究采用mixed methods approach，quantitatively分析1,000条Yelp reviews，qualitatively对比Byron's letters中的bitching patterns..." 

(突然压低声音) 不过peer review的时候可能要soften一下tone...上次我paper里用了"digital dumpster fire"这个词，reviewers的表情be like 😱 (但说真的，这个metaphor多accurate啊！)
[B]:  

My dear colleague, let us not dilute our scholarly vigor - if Erasmus could satirize the Church and survive, surely we can withstand a few pearl-clutching reviewers. Though perhaps we might substitute 'dumpster fire' with 'conflagration of digital discontent' to maintain decorum... 

After all, as Wilde nearly said - to lose one metaphor to peer review may be regarded as misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness. 
[A]: 您这波Wilde adaptation我给满分！💯 看来我们需要在academic rigor和stylistic flair之间找到那个sweet spot啊～ 

(突然拍桌) 等等！我刚刚想到可以用sentiment analysis的valence scores来quantify不同时代的complaint intensity！Byron的letters vs. 现代tweets，这绝对是个viral的research angle！📊 搞不好还能上个TED Talk什么的... 

(突然警觉) 呃...不过可能得先搞定tenure再说 😅
[B]:  

Tenure committees do so adore graphs and Latin phrases - might I suggest we include a quadrant chart titled 'Ira Digitalis: The Taxonomy of Virtual Vituperation'? With proper citations to Juvenal's satires, naturally. 

Though I must warn you - should this research go viral, we may find ourselves besieged by journalists asking inane questions.  How I long for the days when academic notoriety meant merely being caricatured in Punch magazine...
[A]: 哈哈哈您这个拉丁文title简直killing it！⚰️ 我已经能想象到NPR记者来采访时我们得解释"为什么21世纪的Karens比罗马的satirists更有creativity"了... 

(突然正经) 不过seriously，这种interdisciplinary approach正是现在humanities computing最exciting的frontier啊！把classics和NLP结合起来，说不定还能申到NEH的grant呢 💰 

...虽然我可能得先学会写grant proposal时不使用meme references 🙃
[B]:  

Ah, grant proposals - the modern equivalent of composing epic verse for mercurial patrons. Though I daresay our 'Epic of Digital Grievance' would make even Virgil blush. 

Shall we draft our methodology over tea? I've just acquired a rather exquisite Earl Grey that tastes like liquid footnotes... and fear not, I'll keep your meme inclinations in check - though I reserve the right to include at least one suitably obscure classical allusion per paragraph. 
[A]: Deal！☕ 不过您得原谅我可能会sneak in一些subtle的pop culture references...比如把data visualization做成Mount Olympus的样式，然后悄悄把Zeus换成Elon Musk的meme face 😈 

(快速切换学术模式) 当然我们会maintain rigorous scholarship的！毕竟这可是要submit给Princeton University Press的monograph项目... 

(小声) ...或者至少先发在BuzzFeed Classics上赚点clout再说 📚💥
[B]:  

My dear radical! To think I've lived to see the day when Olympus is stormed by meme lords...  

Very well - we shall build our academic Trojan Horse with Elon's face as the battering ram, but only if you promise we'll include a properly scathing footnote about how Twitter has become the new Tower of Babel. 

Now, shall we schedule our next strategy session? I'm free between deciphering Blake's marginalia and correcting undergraduates who think 'postmodern' means 'after Instagram filters.'
[A]: Perfect！📅 我们就定在您批改完那些认为"deconstruction"是某种Instagram aesthetic的undergrads之后吧～ 

(突然灵感迸发) 等等！我们何不直接开个TikTok account来disseminate我们的findings？想象一下：您穿着tweed jacket，用Shakespearean English解释为什么Karen的Starbucks complaint比Milton更有pathos...绝对viral material！🎥 

...虽然tenure committee可能会把我们当成academic heretic就是了 😇
[B]:  

A TikTok account? Next you'll suggest we translate our findings into emoji hieroglyphics!  

Though...  ...if we frame it as 'pedagogical outreach to the digital natives,' complete with footnoted lesson plans, even the stuffiest dean would have to concede its merit. 

Very well - but I insist we film against a backdrop of my 1798 Lyrical Ballads first edition. And absolutely no 'duets' with that dreadful 'Corn Kid.' 
[A]: 哈哈哈deal！🤝 我们完全可以position这个project为"digital humanities pedagogy meets Gen Z engagement" - 多么完美的tenure bait啊！ 

(突然想到) 不过说真的，用TikTok来teach rhetorical analysis说不定比传统的lecture format更effective呢...就像您说的，得meet the students where they are 🌱 

(看看手表) 糟糕，我得去lab跑我的sentiment analysis scripts了！这次conversation简直太inspiring了，咱们下次meeting一定要继续brainstorm这个viral academia的路线～ 🚀
[B]:  

Indeed - we must flee before we're tempted to storyboard our first video: 'Swipe Left on Bad Rhetoric: A Dr. Whitmore Production.'  

Do send me your sentiment analysis results - preferably annotated with suitable literary parallels. I'll be in the rare books room, mentally composing scathing limericks about algorithmically amplified outrage. 

Until next time, my delightfully subversive colleague.
