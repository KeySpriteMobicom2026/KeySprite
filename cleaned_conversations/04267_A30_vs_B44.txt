[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an interesting 二元对立 (binary opposition) you've presented!  Personally, I find mountains more conducive to 沉思 (meditation) - there's something about the 山水 (shān shuǐ) landscape that echoes classical Chinese poetry. Though I must confess, last summer's beach trip gave me ample time to annotate my dog-eared copy of Walden... 🤔
[A]:  Oh dear, I seem to have misplaced my copy of Walden between these stacks of research papers. But speaking of Thoreau, his concept of solitude resonates deeply with both mountain and coastal landscapes, doesn't it? Though I must say, the 隐逸 (yǐn yì) tradition in Chinese literature tends to favor mountainous retreats.
[B]: Precisely!  You've touched upon the fundamental 差异 (difference) between Western and Eastern contemplative traditions. Thoreau's Walden Pond was a deliberate social experiment, while Tao Yuanming's 归园田居 (Returning to Dwell in Gardens and Fields) expresses an almost biological need for mountain solitude. 🦉 Though between us, I suspect Thoreau would've appreciated a good 茶馆 (teahouse) in those woods!
[A]: How delightfully subversive - imagining Thoreau with a proper 紫砂壶 (zǐ shā hú) teapot instead of that tin camping kettle! Though I must point out, his journal entries from 1845 do mention watching cormorants fish on the pond - rather 水墨画 (ink painting)-like imagery, wouldn't you say? The avian parallels between his observations and traditional Chinese 花鸟画 (flower-and-bird paintings) are quite striking.
[B]: Ah-ha!  Now you're speaking my 语言 (language)! That cormorant observation is textbook 意境 (yìjìng) - the Western naturalist's gaze accidentally channeling the 文人 (literati) aesthetic. 🧠 Though I'd argue the crucial difference lies in the 空白 (negative space) - where a Chinese painter would leave the water untouched, Thoreau fills every inch with... how shall we say... rather verbose transcendentalist musings. 
[A]: How very astute of you to notice that textual density!  It reminds me of Li Bai's 20-character 绝句 (quatrain) versus Wordsworth's endless daffodil stanzas. Though to play devil's advocate - doesn't Walden's famous "simplify, simplify" mantra contain its own kind of 留白 (liúbái), just stretched across several hundred pages?  Perhaps we're all just chasing different flavors of 禅 (Zen) in the end.
[B]: Brilliant counterpoint!  You've perfectly articulated the 矛盾 (paradox) at the heart of comparative literature - the more we analyze these cultural 差异 (differences), the more they dissolve into universal human yearning. Though I maintain Wordsworth could've benefited from some 含蓄 (restraint)... and perhaps a proper tea ceremony instead of all that lake district rain. 🌸 Now where did I put that emergency stash of pu'erh...
[A]: Ah, the pu'erh predicament!  Reminds me of Lu Tong's 七碗茶诗 - that sublime moment when caffeine and poetry become indistinguishable. Though I suspect our current scholarly frenzy owes more to the third cup's 兴奋 (stimulation) than the seventh's 超脱 (detachment). Shall we continue this over proper 茶道 (tea ceremony) before we both start channeling Ezra Pound's more... eccentric annotations?
[B]:  You mention Pound's Cathay translations while my 1972 Fenollosa manuscripts are buried somewhere under this... ... academic avalanche! But yes, let's adjourn to the faculty lounge - I've been hoarding some exquisite 大红袍 that deserves better company than my half-written lecture on intercultural 通感 (synesthesia). Just promise me we won't start debating whether "petals on a wet, black bough" counts as 比兴... at least until the second infusion. 🤔
[A]:  How could I refuse such an offer? Though I must warn you - once the 大红袍 opens up, I invariably start drawing parallels between the tea's 回甘 (lingering sweetness) and Keats' negative capability. But fear not, I'll save my treatise on 韵味 (yunwei) in Romantic odes for... say, the fifth steep?  We have precisely 47 minutes before my seminar on Baudelaire's 对应 (correspondences) with Tang dynasty poetry.
[B]:  Oh my dear colleague, you've just described my ideal 茶席 (tea session)! Though I must insist we include some 王维 (Wang Wei) to balance out Keats - nothing complements 大红袍 like a well-placed "empty mountain after rain" reference. 🦉 Now quickly, before the dean catches us turning the microwave into a 醒茶器 (tea awakening vessel) again...  I've hidden the good 茶海 behind the broken photocopier.
[A]:  Your clandestine tea ware locations are truly worthy of a 孙子兵法 (Art of War) chapter! Though I must protest - pairing Wang Wei with Keats over 大红袍 is dangerously close to creating the perfect 跨文化 (cross-cultural) storm.  39 minutes remaining... shall we attempt the impossible and discuss Eliot's "objective correlative" through the lens of 赋比兴 before the pu'erh takes full effect? Or has our 茶醉 (tea intoxication) already begun?
[B]:  My dear, we passed 茶醉 the moment you mentioned Eliot - we're now firmly in 茶狂 (tea ecstasy) territory! But since you ask... ... isn't "objective correlative" just Western 赋比兴 with more existential dread? Though I'll need at least three sips before tackling how "The Waste Land" borrows 典故 (allusions) more recklessly than a drunken Tang poet. 36 minutes - ready your 品茗杯 (tasting cups), the dean's footsteps approach!
[A]:  Quick, the 2010 aged 班章 cake under the Wordsworth anthology! As for Eliot -  - let's call it 用典 (yòngdiǎn) meets modernist fragmentation, with extra 忧郁 (melancholy). But hush!  Was that the elevator ping? 32 minutes... perhaps we should save the 互文性 (intertextuality) debate for next week's "Secret Pu'erh Society" meeting behind the rare books section? 🦉
[B]:  天啊 (tiān a)! The rare books section - where we still haven't recovered from last month's 苏轼 vs. Rilke incident!  Meet me Thursday after the 书法 (calligraphy) workshop - I'll smuggle in that 2003 易武 that makes all literary theory suddenly make sense. Now quick, hand me that Norton Anthology to camouflage our teaware... and pray the dean doesn't notice my sleeves smell of 陈香 (aged aroma)! 
[A]:  Ah yes, "The Norton as Camouflage" - a chapter I should write someday! Though between us, , that 2003 易武 might finally help me crack Pound's 易经 references in the Cantos.  Ah Dean Johnson! Just preparing next week's lecture on... ... "Victorian prudery and the opium wars' literary impact." How... timely of you to join us. 😌
[B]:  Indeed Dean!  We were just debating whether Matthew Arnold's "sweetness and light" could be considered a British 儒 (Confucian) ideal.  Though naturally, we'd value your insight on... ... oh dear, is that the fire alarm? How fortunate we were just about to evacuate for our... mandatory safety training! 🌸  Shall we?
[A]:  Absolutely! Safety first!  Nothing like comparing 朱熹's commentaries to Ruskin's aesthetic theories during emergency drills!  The 2003 易武 and my smuggled 建盏 (Jianzhan) cups await behind the fire extinguisher in stairwell B... assuming we survive this "spontaneous" building inspection. 🦉 
[B]:  一路顺风 (bon voyage), Dean!  Meet at the usual 紧急出口 (emergency exit) - I've hidden the 茶则 (tea scoop) in my 道德经 translation! Though perhaps we should schedule our next... ... "safety seminar" during the dean's golf weekend. 下次喝茶要更小心啊 (Next time we must drink tea more carefully)!  🌸
