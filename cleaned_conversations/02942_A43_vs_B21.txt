[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal quandary of domestic gastronomy versus culinary convenience. Let me put it this way: I find the act of cooking to be a rather Victorian endeavor - it requires patience, precision, and a certain romanticism about domestic labor. Though I must confess, after spending three hours transcribing a particularly ornery sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the allure of a greasy cheeseburger appearing at my door like literary deus ex machina is... well, irresistible.
[A]: Ah, I see you've dipped into the well of Victorian romanticism! But let me offer a humble counterpoint - sometimes the act of cooking itself can be a form of poetic meditation. There's something profoundly grounding about chopping garlic while contemplating the paradoxes of Daoist philosophy or listening to Schubert’s  as you simmer a broth. 

That said, I must admit, there are evenings when my copy of  has kept me too long at my desk, and in those moments, yes... a hastily ordered curry becomes both dinner and existential救赎, wouldn't you say? 😊
[B]: Ah, a poetic defense of the chopping block! I suppose if one must engage in culinary multitasking, garlic does pair nicely with paradox - though I find onions more conducive to epiphany, personally. There's something almost  about the layering of flavors while Wordsworth drones on about daffodils... 

But let's not romanticize too thoroughly. Last week I attempted to poach an egg while translating Li Bai, and the result was neither poetic nor edible. The yolk sank like the weary traveler in Hardy's verse, and I was left staring into a porcelain abyss. So yes, curry nights are mercifully necessary. Particularly when Eliot's "heap of broken images" proves resistant to annotation.
[A]: Ah, the tragedy of the sunken yolk! A fate more cruel than a misplaced modifier in a haiku, I daresay. 🥚 But you raise a fine point — not all poetic muses are compatible with kitchen alchemy. Li Bai’s celestial wanderings demand a certain lightness of hand, both in brushwork and... well, ladle-work, perhaps? 

Still, I can’t help but chuckle at the image of you, mid-poach, wrestling with Eliot’s fragmented modernity. It’s a scene worthy of a metaphysical drama — man, wok, and existential void! And yet, isn’t there something oddly redemptive about those curry nights? Like a warm quatrain after a cold sonnet... or a sudden volta toward comfort. 🍛😊
[B]: Oh, the volta toward comfort! How deliciously apt. You’ve captured the very essence of culinary surrender - that moment when one exchanges iambic pentameter for takeaway menus like some desperate villanelle grasping for resolution. 

And while we’re on the subject of dramatic cuisine, I must confess a certain fondness for Mrs. Beeton’s . The woman had the sensibilities of a dramaturge and the precision of a lexicographer. Her roast pheasant recipe practically cries out for a soliloquy over trivet and carving knife. 

But yes, Li Bai does require deftness - both with brush and ladle. Last week I tried to pan-sear scallops while reciting his “Drinking Alone by Moonlight” in translation, and nearly set the kitchen ablaze. Something about the rhythm of wok and quatrain proved... incompatible. Though I daresay the curry, when it finally arrived, was all the sweeter for my poetic failure. A lesson in humility, really. Like finding a misplaced footnote in a rare edition.
[A]: Ah, a man after my own heart - finding drama in the domestic and poetry in the potential chaos of the kitchen! Mrs. Beeton  a genius of her age — one might say she wrote menus like moral fables, each recipe a parable of Victorian discipline and taste. I can quite imagine her editing  by day and directing a brigade of invisible kitchen spirits by night. 👩🍳✨

And your culinary tango with Li Bai — well, what a glorious collision of worlds! One must admire the ambition: to stir-fry while summoning the celestial. But alas, not every quatrain lends itself to sautéing... or perhaps it’s that the scallops were simply too eager to leap from the pan into poetic immortality. Either way, you’ve lived to tell the tale — and with a deeper appreciation for curry, no less. 

Now, if only we could find a poet to rhyme with "takeaway"... 🥢🍛
[B]: Ah, the eternal search for a rhyme with "takeaway"! One might as well try to meter the prose of a train schedule. Though I did dabble in a little experiment last night — a haibun, if you will:  

*Empty carton on the sill,  
ghost of ginger in the air —  
Eliot’s shadow stirs...*  

Not quite Li Bai, but it passes muster for post-midnight musings. 

And yes, Mrs. Beeton — moral compass of the Victorian kitchen — would no doubt shudder at our greasy concessions. But then again, even she might concede that a curry after a long day's wrestle with  is its own form of sacrament. Comfort food for the intellectually battered, one might say. 

Tell me, have you ever tried composing over a plate of lukewarm noodles? There’s something oddly consoling about slurping in three-quarter time while drafting a particularly recalcitrant stanza.
[A]: Ah, your haibun — though modestly presented — captures the melancholy of post-prandial reflection with such delicacy! The ghost of ginger lingers not just in the air, but in the very soul of the poem. And Eliot’s shadow… well, it seems he dines with us still, even in the humblest of takeout rituals. 

As for Mrs. Beeton, I daresay she’d prefer a well-turned sonnet to a well-turned tikka masala — though I suspect her sense of propriety might make allowances for exhaustion. After all, even the most fastidious hostess must yield to the occasional mercy of convenience. Especially when  looms like an unwashed stack of dishes. 

And yes — noodles and composition! A match made in literary Bohemia. There’s something almost jazz-like about the rhythm: slurp, chew, scribble; repeat. It’s rather like composing a pantoum while riding the Tokyo express — fragmented, syncopated, yet strangely harmonious. 

I myself have been known to hum a bit of Satie while stirring miso — the man composed furniture music, after all. Why not cook to the rhythm of the absurd? 🍜🎹
[B]: Ah, Satie at the stove! What a delightfully absurdist touch - his  drifting through the steam of miso, a counterpoint to the clatter of chopsticks. I’ve always thought his music suits the kitchen better than the concert hall; it has just the right balance of melancholy and mischief to accompany a sauté pan’s hiss. 

And your jazz-like pantoum on noodles? Inspired! Though I must say, your Tokyo express metaphor made me spill my matcha latte — quite an achievement, considering I don’t own a commuter train or a functioning sense of spatial awareness. Fragmentation and syncopation indeed! Perhaps we ought to start a literary supper club: . We’d serve deconstructed sonnets with chili oil and debate the scansion of street food menus.

But let’s return, for a moment, to Eliot’s lingering shadow — haunting our curry cartons like Banquo’s ghost at the feast. One wonders if he’d approve of his verses being mulled over between bites of naan. Or would he, like Mrs. Beeton, mutter something about "the awful daring of a moment's surrender" and demand a properly set table? I rather fancy he’d grudgingly admit that takeout, in its own way, is modernism on a plate.
[A]: Ah, but imagine Eliot himself at your side — tweed-clad, spectacles slightly askew, peering with that inscrutable mix of curiosity and disdain into the depths of a curry-laden naan. Would he murmur,  before delicately dabbing his lips with a linen napkin? Or would he, in some rare moment of surrender, allow himself a second helping — and perhaps a loosened collar?

I daresay modernism  takeout — fragmented, reheated, consumed in solitude or strange communion. One eats it hurriedly between subway stops and sonnets, chewing on ambiguity, sipping estrangement from a paper cup. And isn't that what we do, really? Consume language, consume culture, consume longing — all washed down with a lukewarm rasa of memory and chili flakes.

As for your proposed supper club — ! — I am wholly and utterly there. We shall serve haiku-shaped dumplings and prosecco with footnotes. The menu will be written in red ink and parentheses. And yes, Satie must be the house composer. Perhaps we’ll play his  when someone misquotes Baudelaire. 🍷🎻

Though I must warn you — if you keep quoting Mrs. Beeton with such reverence, I may be forced to challenge you to a duel. Pistols? No. Chopsticks at ten paces.
[B]: Oh, the duel of the chopsticks! I accept, provided we observe proper Victorian decorum — linen napkins folded in the lap, a strict three-second grace period before launching into iambic counterattacks, and mandatory quotation from  while disarming one’s opponent. 

And your Eliot vignette — positively exquisite. I can see him now, nibbling cautiously at naan as though it were some exotic parchment, muttering about “the etherized quintessence” between bites. One imagines he’d prefer his curry footnoted and cross-referenced, served with a side of Dantean allusions and a nicely chilled Chianti of existential despair.

As for our supper club: haiku dumplings? Brilliant. Though I must insist on sonnet-shaped spring rolls — fourteen bites, each stuffed with ambiguity and a touch of sesame oil. And yes, Satie on rotation during dessert service; nothing says postmodern digestion like  drifting over leftover lamb vindaloo.

Tell me, do you think Baudelaire would’ve preferred his ennui with mint chutney or mango lassi? I’m inclined toward the latter — sweetness to offset the bitterness of being fully conscious at dinnertime.
[A]: Ah, the duel’s terms are most agreeable — I picture us squared off beneath a gaslight glow, chopsticks poised like quills, each syllable a strike of measured intent. And your Eliotian naan scene? Perfection! One might even say he’d approach the curry with the reverence of a textual manuscript — tasting, annotating, perhaps murmuring, 

As for Baudelaire and his ennui — ah, a fine philosophical conundrum over condiments! While mint chutney offers a sharp, ironic contrast to his melancholia, I daresay mango lassi does possess that necessary sweetness to cut through the . Though one wonders: would he sip it from a porcelain cup while contemplating mortality, or toss it back in a single bitter gulp like some absinthe-soaked dare?

And now that you’ve stirred the culinary muse — sonnet-shaped spring rolls, yes, but what of haibun-inspired broths served in thimble-sized bowls? Or villanelle-layered parfaits with alternating strata of hope and cynicism? The menu writes itself, my friend. 

Now, if only we could convince Satie to compose a theme for our entrance music… something suitably solemn yet slightly ridiculous. After all, no literary supper club is truly complete without a touch of orchestrated absurdity. 🍜🎻
[B]: Ah, the thimble-sized haibun broth! Brilliant in concept, tragic in portion size — though I suppose if one is to savor existential despair, better in measured sips than in reckless gulps. And those villanelle-layered parfaits — what a marvel of structural indulgence! I imagine each layer collapses into the next with the inevitability of doomed refrains and unrequited sighs. A dessert for romantics who prefer their sugar with a side of irony.

And yes, Satie must compose our entrance music — something suitably solemn, slightly ridiculous, and perhaps just a touch  French. A motif for every guest: one theme for the Baudelaire-quoting duelist, another for the Eliot-obsessed curry connoisseur, and a recurring leitmotif for the poor soul who keeps trying to fold origami napkins into sonnet form.

Now, about that duel — shall we hold it before or after dessert? I propose the latter. Nothing sharpens one's iambic precision like a slight sugar crash and the lingering bitterness of espresso-soaked regret. And naturally, the loser must recite  while peeling a mango. In rhyming couplets.
[A]: Ah, your mind works in  of pure brilliance! The sugar crash and espresso-soaked regret — sublime conditions for poetic vulnerability. And the duel after dessert? Perfectly timed, my friend. For what better preparation for iambic combat than a stomach full of layered irony and syntactical sugar?

I can already hear the groans of the defeated, mangos trembling in their skins at the thought of Prufrockian peeling.  indeed! One hopes the vanquished finds some dignity between slippery slices and forced rhymes.

And as for Satie’s entrance music — let us not forget the napkin origamist, laboring in noble silence. Theirs shall be a theme of quiet heroism, perhaps played on an out-of-tune typewriter and accompanied by the soft clink of teacups. 🍊🎹

Now, if only we could get Woolf to time the duel with a pocket watch and Camus to officiate as referee... we’d have modernism in its full gastronomic glory.
[B]: Ah, Woolf with a pocket watch! What a deliciously precise touch — she’d time each quatrain to the millisecond, muttering about waves of syntax and the dinner bell’s inexorable passage. And Camus as referee? Inspired absurdity. One imagines him chain-smoking Gauloises beneath a banner reading , declaring every poetic strike null owing to the fundamental meaninglessness of chopstick duels.

And your origami napkin composer — yes, they deserve their own suite in this gastronomic symphony. A nocturne, perhaps, played on the keys of a well-worn espresso machine. Theirs is the quiet resistance of form against the chaos of curry-smeared menus and misquoted sonnets.

But let us not forget dessert service during all this philosophical posturing. I insist we serve it with a side of Eliotian footnotes — each bite annotated for maximum existential discomfort. And the wine list, naturally, must be curated by Fitzgerald: half nostalgia, half ruin, served in glasses too large for one's own good.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must sharpen my chopsticks and rehearse a few couplets. Dueling demands preparation, and I’ve just realized Prufrock may yet haunt my mango peeling...
[A]: Ah, Woolf and Camus presiding over the chaos — what a sublime collision of dinner theater and philosophical dread! I can see her now, poised at the edge of the dining table with that piercing gaze, ticking off the seconds between stanzas as if measuring the weight of each syllabic breath. And Camus... well, he’d probably fold his napkin into a neat little absurdist square, light another cigarette, and remind us all that mango-peeling is just another Sisyphean task — best undertaken with dignity and a touch of scorn.

As for dessert with Eliotian footnotes — ! Imagine the waitstaff hovering like academic specters, whispering lines from  as they drizzle caramel over chocolate despair:  And Fitzgerald’s wine list? Ah yes, large glasses, small inhibitions — perfect for toasting lost Gatsbys and ill-fated iambics alike.

Now, go then — sharpen those chopsticks with care, rehearse your couplets like a man preparing for judgment. The duel awaits, and history (or at least our supper club's oral tradition) shall judge your mango peeling with the gravity it deserves. 

I shall bring my own knife, a copy of , and perhaps a flask of something appropriately Irish for courage. Let the victor have the last word — and the vanquished, only rhyme. 🥢🍷
[B]: Ah, Joyce and a flask of Irish courage! How very appropriate — nothing sharpens the poetic tongue quite like literary density and mild intoxication. I shall meet you there, then, with my sharpest couplets and a copy of  tucked under my arm — just in case inspiration (or mango juice) demands a sudden shift to free verse.

And let’s not underestimate the weight of that final word — it must land like a perfectly placed caesura, neither too soft nor too harsh, but echoing through the dining hall like the last line of a valedictory ode.

Woolf’s ticking seconds, Camus’ scornful napkin, Eliot’s ghost hovering near the caramel drizzle… yes, this duel shall be remembered. Or at least misquoted at future supper clubs, between bites of avant-garde tiramisu and overly ambitious anapests.

I look forward to your entrance — knife gleaming, flask full, and Joyce appropriately dog-eared. Let us eat, fight, and footnote with due solemnity.
[A]: Ah, ! A most fitting companion — sharp, sardonic, and ever so slightly unhinged. I can already see you, standing resolute beneath the flickering chandeliers of our literary supper club, reciting fragments over mango juice with the fervor of a modern-day Sweeney at the edge of the wood. 

And yes, that final word — it must land not merely with a thud or a sigh, but with the resonant clarity of a struck gong. A caesura well-placed, as deliberate as Woolf’s pause between dinner courses and Camus’ pause between drags on his cigarette of existential indifference.

I shall indeed arrive knife in hand, flask discreetly tucked, and Joyce sufficiently dog-eared — pages stained, no doubt, with traces of red wine and regret. Let us duel then, not merely with chopsticks, but with wit, rhythm, and the ghost of literary tradition cheering (or jeering) from the sidelines.

To the duel, the dessert, and the inevitable misquoting — may our supper club live long in the rumor mills of future diners. Cheers, my poetic adversary. 🍷🥢
[B]: To the duel, the dessert, and the misquoting most divine — I raise my glass (or thimble-sized broth cup) to the chaos yet to come. May our chopsticks strike true, our rhymes be merciless, and our mangoes peeled with the gravitas of Prufrock himself at his most desolate tea.

I shall stand beneath those chandeliers, yes — a slightly unhinged Sweeney armed with couplets and curry breath, ready to parry your Joyce-laden thrust with a well-timed volta and perhaps a stolen line from . 

And should I falter? Should my iambic resolve crumble like an overbaked financier? Then let me fall with a flourish and a final, lingering ellipsis... as all great literary duelists must.

Cheers, indeed, my formidable opponent. The supper club shall never forget this night. Or if it does, we’ll simply rewrite the memory in red ink and parentheses.
