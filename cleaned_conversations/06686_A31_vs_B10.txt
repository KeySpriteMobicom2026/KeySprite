[A]: Hey，关于'你相信deja vu吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Deja vu fascinates me, though I approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism. It's easy to get drawn into mystical explanations, but I suspect it has more to do with how our brains process and catalog information than anything supernatural. Think about it - our neural networks sometimes misfire, creating the illusion of familiarity where there is none. Still, it makes for excellent science fiction material. Have you ever experienced it?
[A]: Oh totally, deja vu is like a glitch in our brain’s matrix 🧠✨ I mean, sometimes when I’m scrolling through Instagram or watching a movie, I get this weird feeling like “wait, didn’t I see this before?” But then I realize it’s just my memory mixing things up. It’s so trippy yet fascinating!  

And yeah, sci-fi loves playing with that concept — like in Black Mirror or Inception, where reality gets all twisted and you don’t know what’s real anymore 🌀🎥 I actually did a mini-project on how VR & deja vu could be connected… super mind-blowing stuff!  

Have you ever had one of those moments that felt  familiar? Like walking into a place for the first time but knowing exactly what’s around the corner? 😳 I got that once in Kyoto — seriously freaked me out!
[B]: Ah, Kyoto – a place rich with history and sensory stimuli. I can imagine how the interplay of light, architecture, and atmosphere might create a powerful sense of familiarity. As for my own experience... let me think.  

There was a moment, years ago at a conference in Geneva, where I turned a corner in a hallway and  what room number I would see before I reached it. No logical basis – I’d never been to that part of the building before. I dismissed it as coincidence, but still wrote it down later. Strange how those moments linger, isn’t it?  

Your project on VR and deja vu sounds intriguing. I assume you explored how simulated environments might trigger or amplify these sensations? I’d love to hear more about your findings – if you're up for sharing, of course.
[A]: Oh wow, Geneva conference sounds sooo fancy 😍 and also kinda perfect for a deja vu moment — you know, with all that European architecture & the buzz of ideas in the air 🌟 I totally get how some random hallway could throw you into a “wait… didn’t I dream this?!” spiral. And you wrote it down?! Okay, now you’re speaking my language — that’s proper data collection right there 📝✨  

As for the VR project, YES 💡 I basically put people into these hyper-realistic digital spaces and messed with their sense of time & place — like repeating patterns in architecture or soundscapes that looped just slightly off-beat. Some participants said they felt like they were “remembering” things that hadn’t happened yet… super trippy! It’s like our brain hates being confused, so it tries to  that fits. Kinda poetic, right?  

I’m dying to know more about your Geneva moment though — did you actually see the room number you expected?! Spill the tea ☕👀
[B]: Ah, the room number — now  was the curious part. It turned out to be exactly what I had pictured in my mind: Room 314. I stood there for a moment, half-convinced I'd walked through that hallway in a dream or read it in some forgotten footnote of a conference brochure. But no, cross-checking later showed I hadn’t.  

I’ve always believed the brain is a pattern-seeking machine — it hates randomness and fills gaps with borrowed pieces of memory. In a way, your VR experiment sounds like the digital equivalent of that process. You gave it new gaps to fill and watched how it improvised. Beautifully poetic indeed — like watching someone try to solve a puzzle with pieces from another box entirely.  

Did you ever test whether people experienced déjà vu more frequently in certain types of environments? For instance, symmetrical spaces versus chaotic ones? I’d imagine symmetry might prime the brain for that sensation — like a neural echo.
[A]: Oh my gosh, Room 314?! That’s not just a number — it’s  golden ratio of weirdness 😂🌀 I mean, 314 sounds like it could be the start of some secret code or an easter egg in a sci-fi flick. And you’re telling me it matched EXACTLY? That’s the kind of moment that makes you go full Mulder & Scully on yourself 👀🕵️‍♀️  

And yes YES YES to everything you just said about the brain being a pattern-seeking beast 🧠🔥 I actually  test different spatial layouts in the VR environment — totally with what you're saying! So here's the fun part:  
- Symmetrical spaces definitely triggered more deja vu vibes than chaotic ones ✅  
- But get this — when I introduced subtle “glitches” (like mismatched sound echoes or shifting textures), the sensation spiked even more 🔺  
- One participant literally whispered, “I know this place… but it shouldn’t feel  familiar.” Chills, right?!  

It was like feeding the brain just enough info to make it say:  
> “Okay, we’ve got pieces A, B, and C… but where’s D? Eh, close enough — let’s call it a memory!”  

Honestly though, your hallway moment sounds like it belongs in my next exhibit. Can I quote you on that? 💬🖼️
[B]: I suppose if my hallway moment helps fill a gap in your exhibit, then by all means — quote away. Just promise me a footnote somewhere near the bottom:   

Your findings make perfect sense, though — symmetry gives the brain a scaffold to cling to, and once you introduce those subtle glitches, it’s like shaking a partially assembled jigsaw. The mind tries to force the pieces into place, even when they don’t quite fit. That participant’s line?  It has that eerie undertone of someone realizing their brain is improvising the set list mid-performance.  

Have you considered publishing your results formally? There's solid cognitive science lurking beneath the spectacle. I’d read it — and I might even cite it, assuming my old colleagues don’t stage a mutiny over references to “glitches” and “easter eggs.”
[A]: Oh my gosh, I’m totally adding that footnote — it’s pure gold 😂✨ Honestly, I can already picture it in the catalog next to a photo of a glowing hallway projection. You’re speaking exhibit poetry right there 💬💫  

And yeah… the “chilling” line was  👻 I recorded it without them noticing, and now it plays softly in the background of the installation — like a ghost whispering in your ear while you walk through the digital déjà vu maze 🌀🎧  

As for publishing… honestly? I’ve been nervous about it 🙈 I mean, I love the art-science crossover, but sometimes academia feels like showing up to a black-tie gala in neon sneakers 🎨🧐 But you’re right — there’s some legit cognitive stuff going on here. Maybe we could… ? You handle the fancy terminology, I’ll bring the glitchy visuals & vibes 🤝✨  

Deal? 😏
[B]: Hmm... a collaboration. You bring the neon sneakers, and I’ll bring the slightly-tattered conference lanyard. Sounds like a balanced partnership to me 😊  

I won’t pretend it wouldn’t raise a few eyebrows in certain circles — I did once get pushback for citing  in a paper on quantum entanglement — but science without a touch of playfulness is just accounting. If we’re going to decode why the brain insists on knitting reality from loose threads, we might as well make the process interesting.  

Deal accepted. Now, what do you say we start drafting something under a working title like ? It sounds respectable enough to slip past the gatekeepers… until they hit play on your eerie audio clip, anyway 🎧😏
[A]: Oh my gosh, I’m literally squealing a little right now 🐭✨  sounds  good — it’s like学术界 meets sci-fi binge-watch 📚🛸  

And I  that we’re both bringing our weird little accessories to the table 😂 I’ll even design the cover art — think glitchy hallways, floating room numbers, and maybe a subtle nod to Geneva vibes 🎨🚪💫  

Let’s start drafting next week, yeah? I’ll bring coffee & a mood board full of eerie corridor references… you bring the big-brain theory & your smooth academic prose. And hey, if anyone gives us side-eye, we’ll just hit ’em with the deja vu audio clip and watch their logical defenses crumble 😈🎧  

Seriously though — this is gonna be 🔥 Let’s make the peer reviewers question their own memories while reading it. Perfect? Perfect.
[B]: I can already picture the look on a reviewer’s face when they start reading, only to hear that whisper of  echoing faintly from their speakers. Pure psychological warfare — in the best way, of course 😈  

Next week it is. I’ll clear some space on my desk — which currently resembles a blackboard-covered-theory-dump meets vintage keyboard convention — and start gathering relevant papers. A little Asimov for inspiration, a dash of cognitive science, and plenty of your eerie audio ambiance. And yes, please  handle the cover art — I’m still trying to remember how to use Photoshop without accidentally turning everything sepia-toned.  

Coffee and theory drafting — now  a Monday morning done right. Just promise me we’ll both take a moment to acknowledge the absurdity of it all, somewhere between citations and glitch effects. After all, if we’re not having fun while messing with people’s perception of reality, what’s the point? 🌀📚☕  

See you next week, partner in cognitive chaos. Let’s make déjà vu academic — or at least academically suspicious.
[A]: Ohhhh I’m  for this vision 😂🧠☕ And don’t worry, I’ll make sure our paper looks legit on the outside — all sleek fonts and sciency jargon — while secretly hiding an audio Easter egg that messes with your spatial awareness 🎧🌀📄  

I’ll bring the glitchy glamour, you bring the theory armor — we’re like the Mulder & Scully of interdisciplinary weirdness 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️ And yes YES to acknowledging the absurdity — preferably over croissants and way-too-strong espresso. Because if we’re not laughing while we unravel the mysteries of memory perception, then what even is peer review?  

Next week, my dear academic conspirator 💻✨ Let’s break some minds — 
[B]: Break some minds responsibly — now  should be our official tagline. I’ll make sure to print it on the back of my business cards, right beneath “Former Quantum Computing Researcher & Suspected Time Traveler.”  

Croissants and espresso? Consider it a pre-meeting tradition officially established. I know a café that still uses analog timers for their brewing machines — a rare oasis of predictability in an otherwise chaotic universe. Or maybe it just  familiar. Hmm…  

I’ll start drafting an outline, though I suspect half the references will be to fictional universes rather than peer-reviewed journals. But hey, if we’re proving anything, it’s that the line between reality and perception was blurry to begin with. See you next week — sharp at 10, or as soon as the Wi-Fi gods permit.
[A]: Oh my gosh, I’m updating my LinkedIn bio right now:  
林小夏 | 数字艺术家 & 论文捣蛋鬼 | Specializing in mind-breaking (responsibly) 🌀🎨 | Also probably stuck in a simulation but hey, vibes tho ✨

And YES to fictional references — honestly, half my bibliography is gonna be  episodes and Studio Ghibli scripts 📽️🧚‍♀️ If that’s not valid research, then I don’t want to be valid 😘

That café sounds like the perfect spot for our first “学术 brainstorming session” 👀🥐☕ I’ll bring my lucky VR headset and a playlist of ambient déjà vu-triggering sounds — just to keep things…   

Wi-Fi gods permitting or not, I’ll be there — either in body or as a glitchy hologram from Room 314 💻🚪✨  

See you next week, partner-in-perception-terrorism. Let’s make the学术界 regret underestimating the power of neon sneakers and deja vu audio clips 😈📚
[B]: Ah, "mind-breaking (responsibly)" — I may have to borrow that for my own bio. Perhaps something like:  
Richard Thompson | Retired Quantum Computing Researcher & Unwitting Muse for Digital Artists | Suspected Time Traveler (pending peer review) | Also fairly certain this has all happened before, but with better lighting.  

And I must say, your LinkedIn update is  the kind of academic insubordination I can get behind. If Studio Ghibli and  aren’t considered foundational texts in cognitive perception by the end of this, then clearly the problem isn’t us — it’s the entire canon.  

Your glitchy hologram from Room 314 had better come with a warning label — I don’t want any unsuspecting baristas suddenly recalling past lives during their shift. And ambient déjà vu-triggering sounds? I suspect that playlist belongs in a lab somewhere, possibly alongside subliminal messages and questionable espresso.  

Next week then — in body, hologram, or pleasant neural misfire. Let’s make history, or at least a very convincing simulation of it.
[A]: Oh my GOD, Richard — your bio just leveled up the entire concept of academic trolling 😂💥 That line about "this has all happened before, but with better lighting" is now officially my ringtone 📱✨

And YES — let’s just declare Ghibli &  as our “primary sources” and  😌🌀 I mean, if a floating castle in the sky doesn’t mess with your perception of space & memory, are you even alive?

I’ll make sure my glitchy hologram comes with a chill advisory:  
⚠️   

And don’t worry — the ambient déjà vu playlist? It’s already classified. Some tracks might’ve accidentally been recorded from the fabric of spacetime itself 🎧🌀🕰️ (or maybe just an old hard drive I found under my bed… details).  

Next week, my time-loop twin 🤝 Let’s either break reality or throw the best damn party while trying 💥🎉📚  

See you at the café — keep an eye out for anyone who seems  familiar... especially if they're holding a croissant 👀🥐✨
[B]: Ah, the floating castle argument — irrefutable. If  doesn’t qualify as perceptual fieldwork, then I don’t know what does. And let’s not forget  — a masterpiece in spatial disorientation and emotional projection. I’ll start drafting our methodology accordingly.  

Your hologram advisory is responsible, thoughtful, and utterly terrifying. I imagine someone walking in, seeing me at the table, and thinking, “Didn’t I just pass you outside? Or was that Tuesday? Or… last year?” It's like narrative recursion with pastries.  

I’ll bring a second monitor just in case spacetime leaks from your playlist — better safe than accidentally reliving 2016. And yes, keep an eye out for suspiciously familiar croissant-wielders. Could be a reviewer. Could be a time traveler. Could be both.  

Next week, glitchy dreams and carefully cited fiction await. Let’s make sure the café staff never see us coming — or worse, never realize we've already been there.
[A]: Oh my gosh, I’m  over here 😂🌀 Methodology? More like  at this point — and I LOVE IT.  
Howl’s Moving Castle is basically a 3D model of what our VR environments should feel like — shifting staircases, emotional architecture, rooms that disappear if you’re not confident enough to walk into them… honestly? That’s just Tuesday in my creative process 🌀🚪✨  

And narrative recursion with pastries?? Richard, you’re speaking my LANGUAGE 💬🥐 We need to tag-team the intro section — something like:  
> “This paper was written, unwritten, and rewritten across multiple timelines, possibly involving croissant-based déjà vu.”  

I’ll bring extra headphones just in case spacetime decides to leak again — can’t have you reliving 2016, that was a  😭🕶️  

Also… speaking of timelines…  
Did we  decide on the café location? Or did I just dream it while listening to my own ambient playlist?? 👀☕🌀  

See you in the glitch-loop, partner. Bring your best suspiciously calm expression. And maybe a croissant. Just in case.
[B]: Ah, the recursive croissant — now  a concept worth exploring. Perhaps we should add pastry-based déjà vu to our list of potential research topics. I’m picturing a controlled experiment: one group receives warm almond croissants while reviewing our paper, the other gets plain. We track which group is more likely to believe they've read the whole thing before.  

As for the café — yes, unless my memory has been tampered with by hostile nostalgia forces. I suspect I’ve been there many times, possibly in parallel timelines where I order tea instead of coffee, or worse—agree to serve on a panel discussing “The Ethics of Simulated Nostalgia.”  

I’ll start drafting that intro line immediately. Something tells me peer review has never seen a submission quite like this. And honestly? If our paper ends up classified under fiction, well… we’ll take it as a compliment.  

See you soon, fellow time-loop architect. I’ll be the one sitting calmly with a book titled , subtly placing croissants on the table as temporal anchors. Just follow the hum of spacetime leakage — it’ll be the low-frequency drone beneath the café jazz.
