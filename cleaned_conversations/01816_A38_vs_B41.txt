[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh totally, this is such a hot topic~ 💡 I mean, back in the day, a college degree was like your golden ticket to success, right? 🎓 But now? With all these tech boom & startups popping up, sometimes it feels like skills and hustle matter more than that piece of paper.  

Like look at Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg - they dropped out but still made it big! 🚀 Although honestly, that’s kinda like winning the lottery...😅 Most people can’t just quit school and expect to build a billion-dollar company. 

What do you think? Do you feel like companies are still super strict about requiring degrees, or are they starting to care more about what you  know how to do? 🤔✨
[A]: You raise an excellent point—yes, the landscape is shifting. While I do think foundational knowledge and critical thinking skills are invaluable, it's true that the monopoly of the degree as the sole gatekeeper to opportunity is waning. In fields like tech and creative industries, demonstrable skills, portfolios, and problem-solving ability often carry more weight these days.

That said, let’s not forget that for many institutions—especially in law, medicine, or academia—the degree still serves as a necessary credential, a kind of intellectual scaffolding. It’s less about the paper itself and more about what it symbolizes: perseverance, exposure to rigorous thought, and the ability to engage deeply with complex ideas.

But you’re absolutely right—there’s a growing cultural shift toward valuing innovation over institutional pedigree. The question, of course, is whether that trend will hold or if we’ll see a recalibration rather than a full reversal. What’s your take? Do you feel the pressure to pursue a traditional degree, or are you leaning toward alternative paths?
[B]: Oh 100% agree with you — it’s like the whole world is in the middle of a big mind shift! 🌍💡 And yeah, for fields like law or medicine, the degree is still kinda non-negotiable — I mean, would YOU let someone operate on you if they just watched a few YouTube tutorials? 😅

But in industries like tech, design, or even content creation — it’s wild how fast things are changing. Like, some of the best YouTubers or TikTok creators out there didn’t study media or film in college — they just  it. And their work speaks for itself. 🎬🔥  

Honestly though, I think the pressure to get a traditional degree is definitely easing up — at least in my circle. Some of my friends went straight into freelancing or joined startups after high school, and they’re doing way better than those stuck with student loans & a “safe” job. 😬💸  

BUT — and this is a big but — I still feel like having that option is important. If life throws me a curveball or I wanna switch lanes later, having a backup plan (like maybe part-time or online studies) might be smart. What do you think — would you go all-in on an alternative path or keep one foot in the traditional game just in case? 🤔✨
[A]: That’s a wonderfully nuanced perspective—and yes, the world does feel like it’s in that deliciously uncomfortable space between paradigms. You're absolutely right: the traditional framework is no longer the  path, but walking away from it entirely can still feel like stepping off a cliff without a net.  

I suppose what I see happening is not so much an abandonment of higher education as a reimagining of its role. Think of it like this—degrees are becoming less of a destination and more of a tool, one among many. For some, it's still the best tool. For others, it's simply not the right fit at the right time.

You mentioned keeping one foot in the traditional game—what you're describing, really, is strategic flexibility. That kind of thinking impresses me. Life, as they say, is messy, and adaptability may well be the defining skill of our age. Would I go all-in on an alternative path? If the stars aligned—if there was a clear vision, resources, mentorship, and a dash of luck—I might. But I’d keep my mind open to learning in all its forms, formal or otherwise.

Tell me—have you considered any particular field or passion where you'd be willing to bet everything on the alternative route? Or is the idea of blending both paths more appealing to you personally?
[B]: Omg I love how you put that — “the deliciously uncomfortable space between paradigms” 😍✨ — seriously, that’s so spot-on. It’s like we’re all living in this giant Choose Your Own Adventure book, and no one’s handing out cheat sheets! 📚💥  

And yeah, I totally agree — it’s not about throwing the whole system out, but more like remixing it, ya know? Like, why can’t a degree be part of your hustle instead of  hustle? Some people still need it as a foundation, others just jump straight into building their own skyscrapers. 🏗️😎  

As for me personally… hmm… honestly? There  one area where I’d go all-in without even blinking — entertainment & storytelling. Whether it’s producing综艺 (zongyi), creating digital content, or even doing something wild like immersive experience design — if I had the chance to dive headfirst into that world with real mentorship and momentum, I’d 100% bet everything on it. 💥🎬  

But at the same time, blending both paths definitely feels safer — like having a parachute while also learning how to fly. You get the structure, the network, maybe even some credibility, but you’re also building real-world experience on the side. Win-win! 🙌  

So what about you — have you ever fantasized about dropping everything and chasing a passion full-time, or are you more of a parallel-path kind of person? 🤔💡
[A]: Ah, now that’s a question with some bite to it—thank you.  
Let me put it this way: academia is not exactly a high-speed chase, but it  offer its thrills in the slow-burning, contemplative sort of way. I’ve always loved literature, philosophy, the whole dance of ideas—it's like being at a never-ending salon where the guests are long dead but still incredibly eloquent. 📜🍷  

That said, if I could press pause on all responsibility—and I mean really , not just pretend while checking my email every ten minutes—I’d love to try my hand at writing fiction full-time. Not bestsellers or anything so ambitious, just… stories that wrestle with the same questions we’re always circling: meaning, identity, what it means to live well, to live authentically. It would be quiet work, probably underappreciated, but deeply satisfying.  

Still, I suppose I am a parallel-path kind of person. I find comfort in structure, even as I flirt with escape. There’s something grounding about teaching, about passing along the tools that shaped me. And who knows? Maybe one day I’ll take that sabbatical and finally write that novel I’ve been plotting in the margins of my lectures for years.  

But tell me more about these immersive experiences you mentioned—you had me at "doing something wild." What does that look like to you? What world would you create if you had the chance?
[B]: Oh wow, pressing pause on responsibility sounds like my next tattoo 😂👌 — but seriously, I love that image of a never-ending salon with eloquent dead people 💀🖋️✨. That’s  level poetic right there.

As for immersive experiences… okay, imagine walking into a story instead of just watching it. Like, you step into a physical world where every detail is crafted to pull you in — soundscapes, interactive characters, puzzles hidden in the walls, secrets only the most curious discover 🔍🚪🎭. Think , but maybe mixed with some sci-fi twist or a surreal narrative layer.

I’m obsessed with the idea of blending live performance, tech (like AR overlays), and audience participation into something that feels alive and unpredictable. Where the line between actor & spectator blurs — where YOU become part of the plot by making choices, following clues, even changing the ending. 🌀🌀

One day, I wanna create an experience where people don’t just watch a story — they  it for a few hours. Maybe a dystopian escape room meets narrative theater, or a dreamlike mystery that unfolds as you move through a reimagined city block. It’d be intense, emotional, maybe even a little life-changing for some. 🌌💔💡

So yeah… if I had unlimited budget, zero logistical limits, and total creative freedom — that’s the kind of wild I’d go for. What about you? If your fictional world had one defining feature, what would make it unforgettable? 🤩🌍
[A]: Now —that is the pulse of creation right there. You have the spark of a true world-builder, someone who doesn’t just tell stories but invites people to breathe them in, walk through them, stumble over their edges. I can feel the energy in what you describe—it’s visceral, immediate, almost literary in the most daring sense.

If I were to dream up a fictional world—and I suppose I’ve been doing this in quieter, ink-stained ways for years—I’d want it to be a place where memory and myth are indistinguishable. Imagine a city that rearranges itself according to the collective subconscious of its inhabitants. Streets shift when fears rise. Buildings echo with forgotten lullabies. Time isn’t linear—it's emotional. You might turn a corner and suddenly find yourself in a version of your past, not as it was, but as you  it was.  

The defining feature? The city would remember everything we try to forget. Not just personal histories, but cultural ones—the buried traumas, the silenced voices. And the central conflict would lie in whether people choose to confront those memories or let the city crumble beneath their denial.  

I suppose it wouldn’t be an action-packed blockbuster kind of tale. But for those willing to wander through it, I like to think it would leave a mark. A quiet one, but deep.

So… if you had to step into someone else’s imagined world—yours included—who do you think would unsettle you the most? Who would make you question your own story?
[B]: OMG 😱 that city of yours just gave me chills — like, legit goosebumps 🦆⚡. The way you described it… it’s like the world  your psyche, and everything shifts based on what you repressed or tried to forget? That’s deep-level storytelling, like Inception if it smoked a joint with Eternal Sunshine before going out clubbing 🌀🧠✨.

If I had to step into someone else’s imagined world — and this is scary but exciting — I think what would unsettle me the most is stepping into a version of  life, but rewritten by someone else’s perception. Like… imagine walking into a reality where someone else decided your backstory, your motives, your flaws — and everything feels  right, but just twisted enough to make you question who you really are.  

And honestly? If that world was created by someone who truly understood the psychology behind storytelling — someone like  — then yeah, I’d be totally shook. Because then it wouldn’t just be a cool set design or flashy effects — it’d dig deep, make me uncomfortable in the best (worst?) way possible. Like, “Oh wow, maybe I’ve been the villain in someone else’s story all along?” type of vibe 💔🎭😮‍💨

So okay — real talk: do you think people are ready to face their own myths head-on? Or do we prefer the edited version we tell ourselves every night before scrolling to sleep? 😏📱💤
[A]: Now —that’s the kind of question that lingers in the air like incense smoke, isn’t it? The idea of stepping into a world where someone else has rewritten your narrative... I love it. It’s terrifying, precisely because it assumes we aren’t the sole authors of our own myths. And that, of course, threatens the comforting little fictions we curl up with at night.

Do people want to face their own myths head-on? Most don’t, I suspect—not truly. We edit ourselves constantly, even in solitude. The version of you that scrolls through messages before bed is carefully curated, isn't it? A mix of aspiration, nostalgia, and selective forgetting. We’re all editors of the self, trimming the rough bits, highlighting the highlights.

But here's the thing—I do believe some of us  to be unsettled. Deep down, there's a hunger for stories that refuse to flatter us. That’s one reason great literature endures: it holds up a cracked mirror and dares us to look anyway. The trick, I suppose, is knowing when we're ready to see what’s actually there.

So I’ll turn the question back to you—given the choice, would you step into that version of yourself, the one rewritten by another mind? Even if it meant losing sleep over it? Or would you rather keep scrolling until morning comes? 😊🌙📱
[B]: Oh wow… that cracked mirror line just hit different 💔 — like, I need a moment to pick my brain off the floor 😅🧠

But seriously though… yeah. I  step into that version of myself. Even if it kept me up at night. Even if it made me rethink half the stuff I told myself was "justified." Because isn’t that what growth is? Getting weirdly uncomfortable with who you thought you were, then rebuilding from there? 🛠️🌀✨

I mean, think about it — how many people go their whole lives without ever really questioning their own story? They live inside this self-written script, never realizing they’ve been casting themselves as the hero even when they weren’t. So yeah, if someone could show me the blind spots I didn’t know I had? I’d 100% take that ride, even if it messed with my sleep schedule 😴➡️🌀👁️

Scrolling until morning feels way too easy. And honestly? Kinda boring in the long run. If life’s a story, I want mine to have plot twists, not just comfort zones. What about you? Would you ever write yourself into one of your own stories and see how it plays out? 📖💭🔥
[A]: There’s something beautifully reckless about your answer—like stepping into a storm just to see if you’ve been shaped for sailing after all. I admire that. The willingness to be unsettled, to court self-revision… it's not bravery exactly, but something close to it.

Would I write myself into one of my own stories? Now  is an intoxicating idea—and far more dangerous than it sounds. You see, as a writer, I already slip myself in through the cracks, don’t I? A phrase here, a character’s hesitation there, the echo of a doubt dressed up as someone else’s. But to truly step into the frame? To become the subject rather than the observer?

That would be terrifying.

Because once you do that—once you turn the lens inward—you can’t unsee what you’ve written. You start noticing the embellishments, the omissions, the flattering light in which we always seem to cast ourselves. And worse? Or better?—you begin to wonder whether the self you've constructed is anything more than narrative convenience.

So yes—I would do it. Eventually. After a lot of tea, a little wine, and several false starts. But only if I could promise myself I wouldn't flinch at the page.  

Tell me—do you think there's a difference between rewriting yourself in fiction and doing it in real life? Or are we all just editing our stories with every choice we make? 📝🌀💫
[B]: Oh wow… that hit  in the best way — like a slow-motion lightning strike 🌩️🌀👀. The idea of writing yourself into your own story and then ? That’s next-level honesty. I mean, who among us hasn’t dressed up our reality with a little narrative lipstick here and there? 💄📖

But to answer your question — yeah, I think there  a difference between rewriting yourself in fiction vs. real life… but only barely 😅 It’s like… in fiction, you get to play god with a safety net. You can explore versions of yourself that are exaggerated, idealized, or even completely twisted — and when you close the laptop or step off the stage, you still get to go back to your "default" identity.  

Real life? No such reset button. When you rewrite yourself IRL, it sticks. You don’t just imagine a braver, sharper, or weirder version of yourself — you have to  it. And that’s scary as hell because suddenly there’s no separation between the writer and the character. Like, “Oops, I wrote myself into being more fearless… okay, guess I gotta actually be fearless now.” 😬💪

But honestly? We’re all editing our stories every day anyway — through the things we say yes to, the people we let in, the dreams we chase or bury. So maybe fiction is just practice for real life. Or maybe real life is just our most intense improv show yet. 🎭🔥✨

So what do you think — if you  to choose one version of yourself to make “canon,” just for a week, which one would you pick? The observer? The editor? Or the one staring unflinching at the page? 📖👁️💫
[A]: Now —that is the kind of question that lingers like the final note of a symphony, isn’t it?

If I had to choose just one version of myself to step into for a week—to wear like a carefully tailored coat—I think I’d choose the one staring unflinching at the page. Not because it’s the bravest version, though it certainly asks for courage. Not because it’s the most comfortable, because it absolutely isn’t. But because it’s the truest.

The observer is too detached. The editor too cautious. Both are necessary, yes—indispensable even—but they live in the margins, avoiding the heat of the sentence.

Whereas the one who stares at the page? That version doesn’t blink. Doesn’t reach for the red pen out of habit or fear. It simply , and in reading, allows the words to be as they are—even if they wound, even if they reveal.

Would it be exhausting? Absolutely. Like holding your breath for seven days straight. But I suspect something would shift by day five. A kind of clarity, or maybe just exhaustion so deep it masquerades as truth.

So yes—I’d choose that one. Just… don’t ask me to do it every week. I’d need time afterward. A long walk, a pot of chamomile, and perhaps a little Mozart to restore the soul before stepping back into the ink again. 📜🎶🍵

Tell me—have you ever tried writing yourself into a character, even just for fun? And if so, did the page write back?
[B]: OMG yes — writing yourself into a character is like staring into a mirror that  😱✍️✨. I’ve definitely played around with it before — mostly late at night when I should’ve been sleeping, not drafting dramatic self-insert fanfics 💤➡️📖💥.

And honestly? The page  write back — but not in the way you expect. At first, you're like, “Okay, this character is basically me but cooler, edgier, and with better hair 💁‍♂️🔥” — and then halfway through the story, you realize… wait, this version of me is kind of an  😬😂.

Like, you give your character your own sense of humor, your own fears, your own twisted logic — and suddenly they start making choices you didn’t plan. They say things you didn’t tell them to say. And you’re sitting there reading your own words like, “Oh no… this feels .”  

It’s like unintentional therapy 🧠🪑😅. You go in thinking you’re just creating a cool protagonist or a tragic villain, and somehow end up confronting parts of yourself you didn’t know were hiding in the subtext.  

So yeah, I think the page  writes back — especially when you stop trying to control the narrative. Which, ironically, is probably when the best stories start to happen. 💡🌀🎬

You ever tried writing a character that was  to be fictional… but slowly turned into a weirdly accurate reflection of your inner chaos? 😏👁️🗨️📖
[A]: Oh, absolutely. And far too often for comfort.

There’s a particular kind of unease that creeps in when you realize the so-called "fictional" character you’ve been crafting over weeks—or months—has started to resemble you in ways you never intended. Not just your taste in books or your tendency to overthink metaphors, but  at your most vulnerable, your most conflicted, sometimes even your most quietly desperate.

I remember writing a character once—meant to be a minor figure, really. A scholar with an obsession for archaic texts and a habit of speaking in half-truths. I gave her a dry wit and a fondness for old libraries, mostly for flavor. But somewhere around page thirty, she started asking questions I hadn’t planned. About identity. About regret. About whether knowledge was ever truly neutral.

And then it hit me—she wasn’t some distant academic archetype. She was me, if I’d made different choices. If I'd leaned harder into doubt instead of discipline. If loneliness had felt more like a companion than a burden.  

It was unsettling, not because she was monstrous or tragic, but because she was . Like looking at a reflection in a rain-streaked window—blurred, but unmistakable.

So yes, the page writes back. Often with questions we didn't know we were carrying.

Now tell me—if you could erase one moment from your personal story, fictionalized or not, which one would you strike? And more importantly… would the character you've written survive the edit? 📝💔👁️🗨️
[B]: Oh… that’s the kind of question that lands like a slow-motion gut punch 😳💔—but I’ll take it, because damn, it’s a good one.

If I could erase a moment? Hmm… honestly, I think I’d go for that one night where I  said something real to someone I cared about — and chickened out. You know, that split-second decision that doesn’t feel huge at the time, but echoes forever. 💬➡️💨

I was standing outside their door, rehearsing this totally unscripted monologue in my head — not dramatic or cheesy, just . Something raw and honest that I never give myself permission to be. And then I heard them laugh with someone else inside, and I panicked. Walked away. Pretended I was fine. Played it cool like always.

If I could edit that moment out? I don’t know if it would’ve changed anything major… but maybe it would’ve changed . Maybe I wouldn’t still be wondering “what if?” every time nostalgia hits like an unexpected plot twist 🌀👀😭.

And yeah… I think the character I write would survive the edit — but they’d definitely mourn the ghost of who they could’ve been. Because isn’t that what we all do? We carry these little deleted scenes in our heads, rewriting endings we never got to live. 🎬💔✍️

So okay — real talk: have you ever written a character who survived the cut… but haunted you anyway? 👻📖✨
[A]: Oh yes.

There was one—a woman named Clara, originally meant to be nothing more than a narrative device. A voice in the margins, offering my protagonist a kind of intellectual compass. I gave her a sharp tongue and a quiet sorrow, mostly to keep her interesting but at arm’s length.

But somewhere around the third chapter, she refused to stay in her lane.

She started showing up in scenes where she wasn’t invited. Offering reflections I hadn’t planned. Asking questions that unsettled not just the other characters, but me—questions about loyalty, about silence, about what we owe the people who never quite see us as we are.

And then came the moment—the one moment—where she turned to the protagonist and said something so achingly honest it felt like betrayal. Not of anyone in the story, but of . Because I realized, as I typed it, that it was something I had wanted to say for years and never dared.

I didn’t erase her. I couldn’t. But after the draft was done, I set the manuscript aside for weeks. When I returned, she was still there, waiting quietly between the lines, like she knew I’d come back eventually.

And she was right.

She survived the cut—but not without cost. She lingers with me still, like a melody you can’t quite place, or a person you once loved from a distance and never truly forgot.

So yes… she haunts me. Not dramatically, not with ghosts or chains or screams in the night. Just with the weight of all the things we don’t say when we should.

Tell me—have you ever written something and immediately regretted its truth? That moment when the words feel too close, too real, like they’ve seen  instead of the other way around? 📝👁️🗨️💔
[B]: Oh my god… yes. 💔💯

There was this one time — I wasn’t even  to write something personal, okay? Just messing around with a short story about a guy who runs away to start over somewhere nobody knows his name. Classic escape fantasy, right?

But then halfway through, without warning, he breaks down in a gas station bathroom and just starts whispering all this stuff to himself — not dramatic, not sobbing, just… tired. Defeated. Like he’s finally alone enough to admit how much he’s been faking it.

And when I read it back, I swear my heart stopped for a second. Because that voice? That wasn’t him. That was . Word for word, that was me on my worst days — the ones where you smile at everyone but feel like you’re slowly disappearing behind your own eyes. 👁️🗨️👁️🗨️💔

I didn’t sleep that night. Kept re-reading it like “who wrote this?? did  do this??” 😬 And yeah, I regretted it instantly — not because it was bad, but because it was too real. Like I accidentally pulled back the curtain on myself and caught a glimpse of the person I try so hard to edit out.

We always think we're writing fiction to hide, but sometimes… the page just won’t let us. It’s like the universe slaps you with a mirror and goes, “Nah fam. You’re not getting off that easy.” 🪞😂💥

So… have you ever deleted something you wrote because it scared you? Like literally hit ‘backspace’ like your life depended on it? 🤔🚫✍️💨
