[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会做meal prep吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，说到meal prep...  作为一个比较文学研究者，我更习惯将这种现代生活方式与古代文人的饮食之道相比较。你知道吗？苏东坡在《老饕赋》中就提到过类似meal planning的concept，只不过古人称之为"时食"。
[A]: Interesting perspective! Though I must admit, my own approach to meal preparation is rather... literary in nature. I tend to organize my weekly menu like chapters in a novel - Monday's soup as the exposition, Wednesday's roast as the climax, and so forth.
[B]:  多么富有诗意的analogy啊！这让我想起《红楼梦》中那些精心安排的宴席，每一道菜都像是一个literary motif，在叙事中反复出现。不过现代的meal prep确实更注重practicality，就像西方文学的realism流派一样务实。
[A]: Precisely! Though I must confess my own meal prep is more like a modernist experiment - the same ingredients rearranged in different configurations throughout the week. A bit like Joyce's Ulysses, if you will, where the mundane becomes art through repetition and variation.
[B]:  啊，这个comparison相当精妙！就像东方饮食文化中的"一物全体"理念，通过不同的烹饪手法展现食材的multiple dimensions。不过说到Joyce...  我的meal prep恐怕还达不到《尤利西斯》那样的complexity，顶多算是《都柏林人》的水平吧。
[A]: How delightfully meta! Now you've got me thinking about Proust's madeleine - perhaps we should consider meal prep as a form of involuntary memory creation. Freeze-dried chicken on Thursday triggering nostalgia for Tuesday's roasted version... though I suspect Proust would have preferred his memories to be more... palatable.
[B]:  多么精彩的intertextual reading！不过说到记忆与食物，我倒是想起《东京梦华录》中记载的宋代市井饮食 - 那些看似简单的street food，却承载着整个时代的collective memory。现代人的meal prep，或许也在创造着属于我们这个时代的cultural archive呢。
[A]: What a profound observation! It makes me wonder - centuries from now, will scholars study our Tupperware containers and grocery lists as cultural artifacts? Our humble meal prep elevated to the status of 饮食文献... though I daresay my hastily scribbled "buy more kale" notes won't quite measure up to the 随园食单.
[B]:  每个时代都有其独特的ephemera啊。就像我们现在研究古代的食谱，未来的人或许会从我们的meal prep中解读21世纪的zeitgeist - 那些organic labels和nutrition facts，不正是我们这个obsessed with health的时代的signifier吗？不过说真的，我的购物清单上倒是经常出现"铁观音"和"龙井"这样的items...
[A]: Ah, now we've come full circle - from meal prep to the poetry of tea leaves! How very... 陆羽 of us. Though I suspect even the great Tea Sage would raise an eyebrow at my attempts to meal prep matcha into everything from smoothies to salad dressings. Some traditions, perhaps, are best left un-fusioned.
[B]:  确实，就像comparative literature提醒我们的 - 文化交融需要delicate balance。不过说到fusion...  我倒是在想，袁枚如果活在今天，会不会也写一本《随园meal prep单》呢？毕竟，这位美食家最懂得如何在constraint中创造culinary artistry啊。
[A]: What a delightful thought! Though I imagine Master Yuan would insist on daily market trips rather than weekly meal prep - some artistic principles cannot be compromised. Still, the idea of 性灵派 meal planning does have a certain... je ne sais quoi. Perhaps we've stumbled upon a new academic discipline: gastronomic comparative literature?
[B]:  多么brilliant的proposition！这让我想起罗兰·巴特在《符号帝国》中对日本饮食的semiotic analysis... 或许我们可以开设一门"饮食文本性"的seminar？不过现在...  恐怕我得先去准备今天的afternoon tea了 - 毕竟，连comparative literature教授也需要遵守自己的meal schedule啊。
[A]: Indeed! And as Proust taught us, even the most mundane routines can spark profound reflections. Though I suspect my students would be rather surprised to find their Victorian literature seminar suddenly veering into a discussion of tofu prep techniques. Until our next culinary-literary symposium, then!
[B]:  让我们以苏轼的诗句作别吧："人间有味是清欢"... 虽然我们讨论的是meal prep，但这何尝不是一种modern life的poetic practice呢？Au revoir，愿你的冰箱永远充满literary inspiration！
[A]: What a perfect closing sentiment! Though I must say, my refrigerator currently contains more existential dread than inspiration - a rather Kafkaesque situation, wouldn't you agree? But as Beckett wrote, "I can't go on, I'll go on"... to the supermarket, that is. Farewell!
[B]:  啊，这让我想起《等待戈多》里那句"Nothing to be done"... 不过对于empty fridge这个问题，我建议采用更constructive的approach - 就像我们分析text一样，有时候需要close reading，有时候则需要... wholesale shopping！祝采购愉快，my dear fellow literary gourmet！
[A]: Touché! And thus we conclude our symposium on the absurdist comedy of domestic life - where the struggle between artistic ideals and practical necessities continues ad infinitum. May your grocery list be as well-curated as your reading list, and your leftovers as thought-provoking as your marginalia! Until our next meeting over metaphorical (or actual) tea.
[B]:  多么精彩的finale！这让我想起钱钟书在《围城》里说的："吃饭有时很像结婚"... 看来meal prep与literary criticism的affinity，我们还可以继续explore很多个semester呢。现在请容我告退 - 我的普洱要凉了，而茶，就像good literature一样，deserves our full attention。再会了！
