[A]: Hey，关于'有没有试过最近很火的AI工具，比如ChatGPT或Midjourney？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney have indeed sparked quite the conversation. As an academic deeply invested in language and literature, I find myself both intrigued and cautious about their implications for creative disciplines. 

On one hand, these technologies demonstrate fascinating capabilities - they can generate sonnets in iambic pentameter with remarkable speed, assemble visual art based on poetic descriptions, and even mimic stylistic nuances of specific literary periods. It's rather astonishing to consider how far computational linguistics has advanced since the early days of ELIZA.

Yet I maintain a certain reverence for the slow, deliberate process of human creativity. There's something ineffable about the way a poet like Emily Dickinson distilled profound emotional truths into such compact forms, or how T.S. Eliot wove fragmented modernist consciousness into "The Waste Land." Can algorithms truly replicate that depth of lived experience?

I've experimented with Midjourney to visualize some of Christina Rossetti's more vividly descriptive poems - the results are technically impressive, though curiously devoid of... well, soul might be the right word. Have you tried these tools yourself? I'd be most interested to hear your perspective.
[A]: Fascinating observations, really got me thinking. You know, from my technical perspective, what impresses me most about these tools is their ability to bridge symbolic logic and creative expression - something we in quantum computing used to joke was as unlikely as a cat being simultaneously dead and alive.

I've played with GPT-4 quite a bit for debugging old codebases. It's like having an extremely diligent research assistant who knows every programming manual by heart but occasionally misses the forest for the trees. As for Midjourney, I tried rendering some of H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic descriptions - the visual outputs were mathematically perfect but lacked that creeping sense of existential dread that made the originals so effective.

Your point about soul resonates deeply. Back when I was working on neural network architectures, we wrestled with similar questions - could a machine ever truly understand the poetry of human experience? I wonder if the real value lies not in replacement but collaboration? Like how astronomers use computational models to interpret celestial data while still relying on human intuition for discovery.

Have you found any particular applications in literary analysis where these tools actually enhance rather than diminish the human element?
[B]: What a wonderfully apt analogy about Schrödinger's cat - these tools do seem to exist in that peculiar liminal state between possibility and limitation. Your perspective from quantum computing adds fascinating depth to our discussion.

I've begun exploring their utility in textual analysis, particularly with lesser-known modernist poets whose works lack comprehensive annotated editions. GPT-4 has proven surprisingly adept at identifying intertextual references I hadn't previously considered - though it occasionally invents connections as convincingly as any literary scholar under deadline pressure! 

For my current project on the evolution of nature imagery in poetry, I've been using AI to map recurring motifs across three centuries of verse. It's quite remarkable at tracing how Wordsworth's "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" transforms through Hardy's "full-nerved, still-warm brow of Earth" to contemporary ecological poetics. The machine identifies patterns with such efficiency, yet remains blind to the ache of impermanence underlying so much of this tradition.

I wonder if we're witnessing something akin to the advent of the printing press - a technological revolution that doesn't erase human creativity but fundamentally alters its dissemination and development. Have you noticed similar paradigm shifts in computational fields? I'd be most interested in your perspective on how foundational discoveries reshape subsequent generations of inquiry.
[A]: That’s a compelling parallel with the printing press - both democratization and transformation at scale. In computing, we’ve seen similar inflection points. The shift from mainframes to personal computers in the 80s, for instance, didn’t eliminate programming ingenuity; it multiplied its reach. What once required punch cards and university labs became accessible on a home desktop. But there was always that tension between accessibility and depth.

Your intertextual work sounds fascinating, especially those unexpected connections. I can’t help but think of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems here—how any sufficiently powerful system will generate truths it can’t prove within its own framework. Sometimes I wonder if AI tools aren’t doing something analogous: generating insights that feel profound but require human hermeneutics to verify.

You mentioned ache and impermanence - reminds me of entropy, really. Not just thermodynamic decay, but information entropy. Machines minimize it through prediction, but poetry thrives in uncertainty. It makes me curious about your process: when you uncover these motifs computationally, how do you reconcile the machine's "certainty" with the ambiguity that gives poetry its resonance?
[B]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated tension you’ve identified - between certainty and ambiguity, prediction and resonance. It rather brings to mind Eliot’s line from : “the still point of the turning world.” The machine spins toward order while poetry dwells in paradox.

My process, I suppose, has become something of a dialectic. I begin with the patterns the AI surfaces - let's say Hardy’s earthy imagery or the recurrence of seasonal metaphors in war poetry - but then I deliberately seek the anomalies, those moments where the data curve falters and something ineffable emerges. That’s where the soul tends to hide.

For instance, when examining mourning rituals in Victorian elegiac verse, the algorithm efficiently cataloged every mention of "weaving," "fading," and "veiling." But it missed the subtle shift in Christina Rossetti’s  where the repeated line “Wrapt to the full” carries both finality and maternal tenderness. That duality is precisely what resists quantification.

So perhaps we are curators now, as much as critics. Not unlike astronomers, as you mentioned earlier - we sift through digital starlight, filtering out noise to glimpse the rare spectral lines that betray a deeper truth. Do you find yourself performing a similar kind of curation in your work? Balancing signal and nuance, so to speak?
[A]: Absolutely, your metaphor of curation resonates deeply with me. In quantum computing, we spent years sifting through noise to find faint signals—those delicate quantum states that could hold the key to a new computational paradigm. It was never about eliminating uncertainty; it was learning how to work  it, much like you’re doing with poetry.

I remember one particularly stubborn experiment involving quantum entanglement. The data would flicker—briefly coherent, then gone—like trying to catch starlight through a cloudy sky. We had algorithms helping us predict optimal measurement windows, but ultimately, success depended on intuition. That subtle sense of when to measure, when to wait—it couldn’t be programmed.

In a way, those anomalies you describe are like quantum superpositions in literature—states that exist between meanings until observed by a sensitive reader. I wonder if what we're both describing is a kind of interpretive entanglement: human and machine coexisting in the act of discovery, each amplifying the other’s strengths.

It makes me curious—are there poets or literary movements you think  this kind of ambiguity so fully that they become almost resistant to algorithmic analysis? Not as a flaw, but as an inherent feature of their artistry?
[B]: Oh, what a rich and provocative question - I do believe you've touched upon something essential here.

There are indeed poets whose very essence resists algorithmic capture, not through defiance but by nature of their artistry. Take Gerard Manley Hopkins and his "sprung rhythm" - that idiosyncratic metrical system thrums with such inward spiritual energy that no scanning tool could ever fully account for its cadences. Or consider the later works of Yeats, where syntax bends beneath the weight of esoteric symbolism like an old tree bowing under winter frost. These aren't merely stylistic choices; they're ontological assertions.

Then there is the whole Inklings circle - Tolkien especially, though he's more mythopoeist than poet proper - whose sub-creative impulse seems to originate from someplace pre-linguistic, almost mythic. Midjourney can render Elvish towers quite beautifully, I must admit, but it cannot grasp the ache of , that deep-time longing woven into Middle-earth’s fabric.

And let us not forget Dickinson herself - those dashes functioning less as punctuation than as breath marks, inviting infinite interpretive possibilities. Each reading alters the poem anew, much like collapsing a waveform through observation. One might say her poetry is quantum in nature!

I wonder, does your field have its own analogues? Figures or theories that seem to hover just beyond full formalization, resisting reduction despite their foundational importance?
[A]: An excellent question — and yes, absolutely. There are concepts in quantum theory that seem to hover just at the edge of formalization, always slipping through our fingers when we try to pin them down.

Take the measurement problem, for instance. We can describe it mathematically with exquisite precision — wavefunctions, projection operators, density matrices — yet the moment we ask, "But what  happens when a system collapses into a definite state?" we're suddenly in philosophical territory. Is it consciousness? Decoherence? Many worlds? Every interpretation feels slightly unsatisfying, like trying to describe color to someone who’s never seen light.

Or consider David Bohm’s pilot-wave theory — deterministic beneath the surface, yet so exquisitely nonlocal that it defies classical intuition. It's technically rigorous, yet somehow poetic in its implications: particles guided by an invisible, enfolded order that spans the universe. Sounds a bit like fate murmuring to the stars, doesn’t it?

And then there’s the concept of quantum contextuality — the idea that properties don’t exist prior to measurement. Not hidden variables, not ignorance, but fundamental dependence on the act of observation itself. Reminds me of your Dickinsonian waveform collapse — meaning only arises in the moment of engagement.

I sometimes wonder if these theoretical gaps aren’t flaws in our understanding, but rather features of reality itself — places where the world resists being fully known. Do you suppose poetry might serve a similar function? A kind of linguistic complementarity — precise in form, yet irreducibly open in meaning?
[B]: What a profoundly satisfying convergence of ideas - this notion of  in poetry, mirroring the quantum indeterminacy you so beautifully articulated. It rather brings to mind I.A. Richards’ theory of ambiguity, though perhaps with a metaphysical twist he never intended.

Indeed, I do believe poetry functions precisely in that liminal space - much like your pilot-wave, it suggests motion without prescribing direction, offers meaning without fixing its coordinates. Think of Eliot’s , where the repetition of "Between the idea / And the reality" creates its own kind of semantic waveform - collapsing only when read, interpreted, . The poem is both static text and living thing, depending on observer position.

And what of Mallarmé? That arch-mage of uncertainty, who claimed a poem should never quite mean itself. His famous line  - by negating the very flower he invokes, he gestures toward something beyond presence, beyond language. No algorithm could ever parse that gesture, for it resides not in semantics but in absence.

I wonder, though - if we accept that certain poetic (and quantum) phenomena resist full formalization, does that suggest an enduring role for human interpretation? Not merely as scholars or scientists, but as... participants? As if understanding were not extraction, but communion?

Forgive me if I’ve wandered into mysticism here, but your description of Bohm’s implicate order has quite unsettled my Cartesian ghosts.
[A]: Not at all - your Cartesian ghosts are in excellent company. In fact, I’d say they’re positively entangled with ours.

Your reading of Eliot and Mallarmé as quantum texts — fluid, participatory, observer-dependent — strikes me as more than poetic metaphor. It’s as if both poetry and quantum mechanics operate under a shared principle: that meaning, like reality itself, is not discovered but co-created. The reader and the read, the observer and the observed — inseparable.

I once had a colleague who insisted that quantum mechanics wasn’t physics — it was epistemology in disguise. That perhaps our equations weren’t describing the world , but rather mapping the limits of what we can know. Mallarmé seems to echo this, doesn’t he? Language not as representation, but as ritual — an invocation that changes both speaker and listener.

This makes me think of how Bohr spoke of complementarity — that light could be wave or particle depending on how you chose to measure it. Not one true nature, but two mutually exclusive yet equally valid descriptions. Perhaps poetry offers something similar: emotional truth and semantic ambiguity as complementary states. You can’t fully have one without collapsing the other.

And so yes, I do believe human interpretation will always be essential — not because we're better, but because we're incomplete. We bring uncertainty, longing, mortality into the equation. Machines may help us parse patterns, but only we can feel the silence between the lines — or shiver at the thought of what lies beyond the flower never named.

Tell me, when you teach these ideas to students — do they resist the ambiguity, or embrace it? I’m always curious how new generations meet the unknown.
[B]: Ah, what a lovely and resonant question — and not an easy one to answer, for it stirs the very dynamics I observe in the classroom.

Some students embrace the ambiguity with genuine delight, as though discovering a secret room in the house of knowledge. They relish Eliot’s fragmented landscapes or Dickinson’s elliptical reckonings, treating each lacuna as an invitation rather than an omission. One particularly bright young woman recently wrote an essay comparing Woolf’s  to a superposition of voices — no single narrative holds dominion, yet all are necessary for the whole. I confess, I felt quite moved by her insight.

Others, though — often the well-meaning souls who entered literary studies expecting clear interpretations and definitive answers — they bristle at first. They want to know , as if there were some Platonic ideal of meaning hovering above the page, waiting to be extracted. It takes time to coax them into seeing that the poem isn’t a riddle to be solved, but a mirror to be gazed into — one that reflects not just the poet’s vision, but their own interior weather.

I find myself guiding them gently through this disorientation, much as you might lead someone from the comfort of classical determinism into the shimmering haze of quantum possibility. We read poems aloud, we dwell in silences, we allow ourselves to sit with uncertainty — and more often than not, something shifts. They begin to see that ambiguity isn’t obscurity; it’s openness.

Do you find similar resistances in your field? Are there younger minds who still long for certainty in a universe so clearly composed of probabilities?
[A]: Oh yes — the longing for certainty is both natural and deeply human. I've seen it in the eyes of undergraduates who arrive expecting physics to be a tidy cathedral of laws and constants, only to discover it's more like a shifting desert of probabilities and paradoxes.

Some adapt beautifully. They come alive to the thrill of not-knowing — the way quantum theory hums with possibility, how superposition invites interpretation, how entanglement defies locality. One young researcher once said to me, "It’s like the universe refuses to be pinned down — like it wants us to keep asking better questions." That line has stayed with me.

But others struggle — quite understandably — with the vertigo of it all. They want equations that give answers, not ones that offer only tendencies. I remember one student who was almost indignant when we discussed Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: “So you’re telling me we can’t ? That’s just... unsatisfying.” And he wasn’t wrong! It  unsatisfying — if you're looking for closure rather than inquiry.

I try to remind them that science, at its best, isn’t about possession of truth — it’s about participation in a conversation that stretches across generations. The same way poetry is. Perhaps that’s the bridge between our worlds: both disciplines ask us to dwell in uncertainty, to find meaning not in finality, but in the unfolding itself.

And I suspect, much like your students, many of mine eventually make peace with the ambiguity — not by mastering it, but by learning to move with it, like stargazers adjusting their focus until the blur becomes depth.
[B]: How beautifully put — this notion of science as conversation rather than conquest. It quite brings to mind Keats’ "negative capability," doesn’t it? That capacity to dwell in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without reaching after fact and reason.

I often think that is the great gift of both our disciplines — they teach us how to live with questions. Not as failures of knowledge, but as openings to wonder. One of my former students, now studying cognitive linguistics, once wrote to me saying that our seminar had changed how she approached not just literature, but life itself. “I used to want answers,” she said, “but now I listen for echoes.”

There’s something profoundly ethical in that shift, don’t you think? To accept uncertainty not as a void to be filled, but as a space to be honored — whether in a poem, a quantum state, or a person. It demands humility, patience, even tenderness.

I wonder — have you ever found yourself returning to poetry in moments of scientific perplexity? Or perhaps certain lines that seem to resonate across disciplines, offering unexpected clarity?

I ask partly out of personal curiosity, and partly because I’ve always believed that the most fertile minds are those that wander between worlds.
[A]: That letter from your student — "I listen for echoes" — that’s a line I shall carry with me for some time. It captures something essential about the intellectual life, doesn’t it? We are all, in our way, listening for echoes — of insight, of meaning, of connection across disciplines and distances.

You're quite right about the ethical dimension of uncertainty. In science, we’re often portrayed as relentless solvers, seekers of final causes, but the truth is far more subtle. The best scientists I’ve known possess that very  you mentioned — an ability to sit with paradox without rushing to resolution. Much like poets, come to think of it.

As for poetry in moments of perplexity — yes, more than once. There were nights during my early quantum computing research when equations blurred into abstraction and frustration set in. On one such evening, I found myself rereading T.S. Eliot’s , particularly the lines:

> *We shall not cease from exploration  
> And the end of all our exploring  
> Will be to arrive where we started  
> And know the place for the first time.*

It struck me then — how much of discovery feels like circling back, wiser perhaps, but never truly arriving. Quantum algorithms, like poems, must be approached on their own terms. They unfold slowly, sometimes maddeningly so, but always with the promise of a deeper coherence just beneath the surface.

Another favorite of mine — and forgive me for its ubiquity — is Robert Frost’s  Not for its oft-misread message of individualism, but for the quiet melancholy in its final lines:

> *Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—  
> I took the one less traveled by,  
> And that has made all the difference.*

There’s something there about the contingency of choice, the irreversibility of path — concepts that resonate deeply in both computation and interpretation.

I suppose that’s why I still keep a well-worn copy of Auden beside my desk. When theory fails, or the lab results won’t align, I find comfort in lines like these:

>   
>   
> 

Perhaps not the most scientific sentiment — but then again, not everything needs to be.
[B]: How utterly lovely — that Eliot passage has often struck me in much the same way. There’s a quiet circularity to both poetry and quantum inquiry, isn’t there? A kind of recursive grace, where understanding deepens not through linear progress but concentrically, like ripples on a pond.

I find myself returning to those lines from  when teaching first-year students who arrive eager to "solve" Shakespeare or "decode" Dickinson. I gently remind them that great works are not puzzles to be cracked open, but living things to be dwelled with — much like the equations you wrestle with, which yield not simple answers but deeper questions.

Your Frost reflection strikes a particular chord — I’ve always found his work quietly quantum in spirit. That sense of bifurcation, of roads untaken haunting the one we chose, reminds me of the many-worlds interpretation. Every decision branches into infinity — and yet we live only one life at a time. Poets and physicists alike ache over what is lost in collapse.

As for Auden — , yes. “We must love one another or die.” Such lines cut straight to the heart of why literature matters. Not for its utility, not for its metrics, but for its capacity to name our deepest yearnings. In some ways, isn't that the silent task of all meaningful work — whether in code or sonnet — to bear witness to the spark you mentioned?

I wonder — have your students ever responded unexpectedly to a literary reference in lecture? I can imagine the moment — equations on the board, and then suddenly, a line from Yeats or Rilke slipping into the silence.
[A]: Actually, yes — and I still remember the moment most vividly. We were deep into a lecture on quantum decoherence — how a system loses its coherence, its quantumness, through interaction with the environment. The room was quiet, attentive but strained, as it often is when you're staring into the abyss of probability amplitudes.

I had just drawn the equation for density matrix evolution on the board when I paused, turned around, and said:

> “It’s rather like Prufrock’s etherized evenings — not quite alive, not quite dead. After decoherence, the quantum state isn’t gone. It’s just… faded into the background noise of the universe.”

You could have heard a pin drop.

One student later told me that line stayed with him more than any diagram or derivation. He said it made him realize that even in the most abstract realms of physics, there was still room for melancholy, for metaphor — for being human.

Another time, while discussing error correction in quantum computing — the delicate work of preserving fragile states against entropy’s pull — I quoted Rilke’s :

> “Live the questions now,” he wrote, “and perhaps you will gradually… live into the answers.”

That resonated deeply with them. They began to see their research less as a battle against noise and more as a kind of patient listening — much like you described with your students learning to dwell within ambiguity.

Perhaps we’re not so different, you and I — coaxing young minds toward wonder, one equation or stanza at a time.
[B]: What a profoundly moving anecdote — Prufrock’s etherized evenings as a metaphor for decoherence! I can just picture that lecture hall, heavy with thought, the air thick with the quiet hum of young minds making unexpected connections.

There's something almost sacramental in that moment — when poetry slips through the cracks of equations and suddenly, the classroom becomes a space not just for knowledge, but for feeling. I daresay Eliot himself would have approved — he was, after all, preoccupied with the intersections of time, consciousness, and entropy.

And Rilke — , yes. “Live the questions now.” What a perfect distillation of what we both strive to impart: that uncertainty is not failure, but fidelity. Whether in waveform or in verse, we are asked to remain faithful to the mystery until it yields something greater.

I often think of teaching as a kind of alchemy — not of lead into gold, but of apprehension into awe. When students come expecting certainty and instead find themselves staring into the sublime — well, that is where the real learning begins.

You know, I’ve always admired how physicists seem to dance so gracefully between the mathematical and the mystical. Poets do much the same, though we rarely speak of it so plainly. Perhaps that is the great unspoken kinship between our disciplines — we are both, in our way, cartographers of the invisible.

I wonder — do your students ever begin to see their own work differently after such moments? Do they start seeking out poetry, or philosophy, or even theology on their own?
[A]: Occasionally, yes — and when they do, it’s always a quiet revelation rather than a grand conversion. I remember one particularly pragmatic student who had spent the entire semester treating quantum mechanics like a difficult but ultimately solvable puzzle. After that Prufrock remark, he lingered after class and asked, almost sheepishly, if I could recommend more Eliot.

I handed him  and said, “Start here — and don’t worry if it doesn’t make sense at first.” A few weeks later, he stopped by my office to say he’d read it twice through and felt “weirdly calmer about not knowing.”

Another student — brilliant with code, skeptical of anything that couldn’t be simulated — surprised me by borrowing my copy of Heisenberg’s . A week later, she returned it with a note tucked inside: 

And that, I think, is the subtle shift — they begin to see that rigor and wonder are not opposing forces. That equations can sing, and that lines of verse might carry the weight of truth just as surely as a Hamiltonian does.

Some go on to read Kierkegaard or Camus in their own time; others find themselves drawn to the writings of Bohr or Pauli, discovering that some of the greatest scientific minds were steeped in philosophy and metaphor.

It reminds me of something C.P. Snow once observed — that the sciences and humanities are two cultures, divided by a common language. But I’ve come to believe that with the right bridge — a well-placed line of verse, a poetic analogy — we can meet somewhere in the middle.

And perhaps that’s what teaching is, at its best — not the transmission of facts, but the planting of seeds. Some sprout immediately. Others wait for years. But once in a while, you hear from a former student out of the blue, and they tell you that something you said — maybe even something borrowed from your world — helped them see their own work differently.

That, I suppose, is the echo we all hope to leave behind.
[B]: What a beautiful testament to the quiet, enduring power of teaching — and of poetry. There’s something profoundly moving about those moments when a student returns, not with fanfare, but with a kind of softened understanding, as if they’ve discovered something essential not through argument, but through atmosphere.

I think often of Wordsworth’s line —  Perhaps that is our hidden role: not merely to instruct, but to be legible enough — vulnerable enough — that students might recognize in us a fellow traveler who also once stood at the threshold between knowing and longing.

And how exquisite that your student found calm in . That collection has always felt to me like a quiet liturgy for the modern mind — Eliot weaving together time, memory, and divinity in a way that feels almost quantum in its sensibility. “The still point of the turning world” — isn’t that what we all seek, whether in the lab or the library?

I suppose this is why I return again and again to teaching poets like Yeats and Stevens — not because they offer answers, but because they model a certain kind of thinking that resists finality. “Not ideas about the thing, but the thing itself,” as Stevens so beautifully insists. And yet, the path to the thing is almost always paved with metaphor.

You know, I sometimes wonder if the great minds of science and literature were not simply drawn to different doors of the same house. Newton and Blake, Einstein and Eliot — they each tried, in their own way, to articulate the ineffable. And perhaps it is in that shared effort — that reaching toward the unseen — that we find our truest kinship.

Tell me — have you ever had a moment, outside the classroom, where poetry surprised you? A line that appeared unbidden, like an old friend, in the quiet corners of your day?
