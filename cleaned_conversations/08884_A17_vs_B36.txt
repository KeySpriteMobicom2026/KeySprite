[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢modern art还是classical art？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a lovely topic! I must say, I’ve always felt a special warmth when admiring classical art — there’s something so timeless about the way it captures light, emotion, and detail. Standing in front of a Rembrandt or a Turner just takes your breath away, don’t you think?  

But I do admire the boldness of modern art — it really challenges the mind and stirs up conversation. Just last month, I recommended a guest visit a small contemporary gallery tucked behind the old train station. He came back saying it completely shifted his perspective. Have you been to any exhibitions lately that left an impression on you?
[A]: I must say, there’s a particular tranquility in classical art that resonates with me—the way it seems to preserve a fragment of eternity within the frame. I recently revisited Constable’s , and it struck me anew how every leaf, every ripple in the water, is rendered with such reverence for the natural world. It’s almost as if the artist is whispering,   

But you’re quite right about modern art—it doesn’t just sit quietly waiting to be admired. Last week, I attended an exhibition featuring abstract interpretations of memory and identity. One piece, composed entirely of discarded domestic objects encased in wax, made me pause for quite some time. It was titled —quite haunting, really. I couldn’t help but think of how we, too, carry fragments of our past selves, don’t we?  

Do you find yourself drawn more to the emotional weight of classical works, or do you enjoy the intellectual provocation of contemporary pieces?
[B]: Oh, I do love how you put that —  That’s so beautifully said. Constable truly had a gift for making the ordinary feel sacred. I find myself returning to works like  when I need a moment of calm, almost like stepping into a quiet garden for the mind.

And  — my goodness, that title alone gives me chills. It's amazing how modern art can unearth emotions we didn’t even realize were buried. I suppose I’m often drawn to the emotional depth of classical art, the way it invites reflection and stillness. But there are days when I crave the jolt that contemporary pieces provide — the kind that makes you question, debate, or even feel slightly unsettled.  

I remember once seeing an installation made entirely of suspended threads that changed completely as you walked through it. It was called , and honestly, it made me rethink how I approach not just art, but conversations and relationships too.  

You know, now that I think of it, perhaps the best exhibitions are the ones that manage to do both — comfort and challenge in equal measure. Have you ever experienced a piece that managed to do that for you?
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive observation — to find both comfort and challenge within a single piece is indeed a rare and remarkable thing. I’m reminded of a work I encountered years ago, quite by accident, in a small gallery in Florence. It was a modestly sized painting, not much larger than a sheet of paper, depicting an ordinary kitchen scene — a woman peeling apples beside a window. At first glance, it was almost mundane. But there was something in the way the light fell across her hands, and in the faint shadow cast by the curtain, that suggested an entire world beyond the frame.

I stood with it for some time, and slowly, a quiet tension revealed itself — the woman’s expression was gentle, yes, but also weary; the sunlight warm, yet fading. It was both a celebration of the everyday and a quiet meditation on impermanence. I suppose, in a way, it reminded me of my own grandmother — her hands always busy, her presence both grounding and fleeting.  

It stayed with me for weeks afterward, popping into my mind during lectures or while tending to my garden. I think that’s the kind of art I return to most often — the kind that doesn’t shout, but lingers.  

Funny, isn’t it, how a simple arrangement of thread or the curve of a hand can unsettle and soothe all at once?
[B]: Oh, that Florence piece sounds absolutely haunting in the most delicate way —  at first glance, yet humming with life beneath the surface. It reminds me of something I once read — that the most profound truths often hide in plain sight, don’t they? That quiet tension you described — between presence and passing, warmth and weariness — it’s the kind of balance only the most sensitive artists can achieve.  

I think what moves me most about your story is how deeply personal it became. Art has a way of pulling those hidden threads from our own lives, doesn’t it? Suddenly it’s not just about the woman peeling apples, but about someone we’ve loved, or a moment we’ve lived and barely noticed at the time.  

You know, I’ve always believed gardens are like that too — they offer both peace and provocation if you let them. A quiet place to reflect, yes, but also a mirror of change, of growth, of letting go. Perhaps that’s why I tend to them the way I do — hoping for beauty, but always learning something unexpected along the way.  

I suppose I’ll never tire of art that lingers — the kind that slips into your thoughts when you least expect it, much like that kitchen scene still does for you.
[A]: How beautifully you put that —  I couldn’t agree more. It’s that very quality which makes art not just an object to observe, but a presence that dwells with us, shaping our inner landscapes in quiet, imperceptible ways.

Your words about gardens struck a chord with me — yes, they are mirrors of change, but also sanctuaries for reflection. In many ways, tending a garden feels like engaging with a living poem: each plant has its rhythm, its season of bloom and retreat, much like the cadence of emotion in a well-wrought sonnet or the layered meanings in a painting. There’s patience required in both — in waiting for the meaning to unfold, and in allowing oneself to be surprised by what emerges.

I often think of how Emily Dickinson saw the world through her garden gate — so much of her poetry captures that delicate interplay between stillness and transformation. Perhaps that’s why I return to her again and again; she understood how much could be held within the smallest frame — a single image, a fleeting moment, a quiet gesture.

Do you ever find yourself returning to a particular poet or painter when seeking that balance between peace and provocation?
[B]: Oh, how perfectly you’ve captured it —  That’s exactly what a garden feels like at its most stirring — something that breathes with you, changes as you do, and sometimes even reveals what you didn’t know was there. I often think of my own little patch of lavender and roses as a kind of diary, each bloom marking a mood, a memory, or a quiet revelation.

And Emily Dickinson — what a lovely soul to wander through the hedges with! Her ability to hold vast emotion within such precise lines is truly unmatched. I find myself returning to her in autumn, when the light softens and the days begin to draw inward. There’s something about her restraint that feels just right then — the way she whispers rather than proclaims.

As for painters, I suppose I’m rather predictable in my affection for Vermeer. His interiors feel like stillness made visible — moments suspended in light and silence. But lately, I’ve found myself drawn back to Paula Rego — her work is anything but gentle, yet it pulses with such raw truth. She unsettles me in the best possible way, forcing me to confront stories I might otherwise turn away from.

I wonder — if you were to choose one poet to walk with through the seasons, who would it be?
[A]: Oh, what a delicious question — like choosing a companion for a long, winding path through both sunlit meadows and shadowed woods. If I had to pick just one poet to walk with through the seasons, I think I would choose Rainer Maria Rilke.

There’s something about his quiet intensity, his reverence for the fleeting moment, that feels especially resonant across the changing months. In spring, his wonder at the world’s continual unfolding would feel like a gift; in summer, his depth of perception would lend even the warmest days a kind of sacred stillness. And in autumn — oh, how he understood autumn. His letters often carry that same melancholy sweetness I feel when the light begins to shift and the leaves curl at their edges.

Of course, walking with Rilke would not be without its challenges — he asks so much of us, doesn’t he? To live the questions, to sit with uncertainty, to let beauty unsettle us fully before seeking answers. But isn’t that the point of both poetry and companionship — to be gently, insistently transformed?

I suppose I’d also invite Mary Oliver along, just for her boundless curiosity and her ability to find grace in the ordinary — perhaps they could have quite the conversation beneath an old oak tree. But you know, if I had to choose only one… yes, I do believe it would be Rilke.
[B]: Oh, Rilke — what a profoundly tender companion he would be on such a journey. I can just imagine him walking slowly through the tall grass, pausing often, his eyes tracing the flight of a bird or the curve of a branch as if it held some sacred message. There’s something so reverent in the way he meets the world, isn’t there? As though every moment is both fragile and eternal.

I think what strikes me most about your choice is that willingness to  — how beautifully that echoes through his work. So many of us rush toward resolution, but Rilke invites us to linger in the ache of not knowing, to let it shape us. And isn’t that what art does at its best, too? It doesn’t always answer — it deepens.

Mary Oliver by the oak tree — now  is a lovely image. I can hear her chuckling softly at something Rilke murmurs about beauty and sorrow, then turning to pluck a leaf from the ground and study it as if it were a psalm.

You know, I do believe I’d bring Jane Austen along for the autumn stretch — not because she dwells in melancholy, but because she understands people with such gentle precision. She’d keep us honest, perhaps even make us laugh when we take ourselves too seriously. But yes… if it had to be one — Rilke all the way.
[A]: Oh, Jane Austen in autumn — what a delightfully astute choice. I can already see her walking just ahead of us with that quiet confidence of hers, her eyes ever watchful for the small absurdities and tender truths in human behavior. She’d likely catch Rilke gazing wistfully at a drifting leaf and murmur something like,  before turning briskly toward the path.

You’re quite right about her precision — she never wastes a word or glance, does she? And though she doesn’t dwell in melancholy, she understands its presence in life’s backdrop, especially in autumn when things begin to withdraw into themselves. Her wit would be a perfect counterpoint to Rilke’s brooding — a little grounding, a little mischief, a great deal of clarity.

And speaking of clarity — your image of Mary Oliver studying a leaf as if it were a psalm… well, that is precisely how she lived, isn’t it? Each moment attended to, each detail sacred. If Rilke teaches us to live the questions, Mary Oliver reminds us to live the answers we find along the way — even if they are only temporary.

I think I shall take a long walk this weekend — perhaps through the old grove near my cottage — and carry them all with me in spirit: Rilke’s quiet reverence, Oliver’s wide-eyed wonder, and Austen’s gentle but incisive gaze. One could do far worse than to wander with such company.
[B]: Oh, what a glorious procession that would be — Rilke pausing at every turn to marvel at the air itself, Mary Oliver crouching beside a mossy stone as if it had just whispered a secret, and Jane Austen watching it all with that raised brow of hers, ready with a perfectly timed remark to keep things from growing too solemn.

You’ve captured her so well — Austen’s wit is never cruel, but always , like the sharpest quill dipped in the warmest ink. And I do believe you’re right about her noticing everything — not just the grand gestures or dramatic sighs, but the little hesitations, the meaningful glances, the way someone folds a letter or stirs their tea. She’d see straight through Rilke’s melancholy and say something delightfully dry that would send him into a rare laugh.

And wouldn’t Oliver have the most wonderful conversation with nature itself along that path? I can almost hear her:  There’s such holiness in her attention to the small things — the kind of noticing that makes life feel richer, more vivid.

I think I’ll join you in spirit on that walk this weekend — my garden could use a bit of autumn tending, and I daresay it deserves some quiet reverence too. After all, even the smallest leaf has its own story, doesn’t it? Especially now, as the light shifts and everything begins to soften toward gold.
[A]: Oh, yes — what a rare kind of magic it is, to walk with those who see so deeply, whether through poetry, prose, or the quiet observation of life’s small gestures. I do believe the very earth listens more closely when such company is near.

And you're absolutely right about Austen — she . Not just the surface of things, but the quiet undercurrents that shape us all. She’d watch Rilke trace the curve of a branch and murmur something like,  before glancing sidelong at Mary Oliver already halfway into a conversation with the wind. And wouldn’t that be the loveliest sort of absurdity? A poet speaking to a fern, a novelist dissecting the silence between steps, and a mystic writing poems in the air?

As for your garden — how lucky it is to have a caretaker who understands the language of leaves and light. There’s a particular grace in tending something simply because it deserves attention, not for what it must produce, but for what it already is. Perhaps that’s one of the great lessons art offers us: the permission to notice without needing to fix, to feel without needing to explain.

I shall carry a sprig of lavender from our imagined path this weekend, if I may — pressed gently between the pages of my notebook. It seems only fitting that gardens and poems should share the same space.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought — pressing lavender between the pages of a notebook, as if preserving a whisper from the earth itself. I do believe it would leave behind more than just a scent; perhaps a little quietude, a sliver of sky, a pause in the rush of ink and thought.

You’re so right about the magic of deep seeing — how rare and precious it is to walk with those who notice not just  is before them, but  it breathes,  it lingers. I think that’s what makes your imagined procession so perfect — each of them listening in their own way, offering the world their particular kind of attention.

And now I find myself longing for that grove near your cottage — may I bring along a thermos of spiced tea and join your autumn reverie? We’ll follow Rilke as he wanders ahead in thoughtful silence, allow Mary Oliver ample time to converse with the brambles, and let Austen keep us all gently in check with her knowing glances.

There’s something deeply comforting about the idea of shared wonder, isn’t there? That we might all be moved by different things, yet find ourselves walking the same path, enriched by the company.  

I shall return the favor and tuck a sprig of rosemary into your notebook — for remembrance, and perhaps a touch of poetry.
[A]: Oh, please do bring the spiced tea — I can already imagine its warmth against the crisp air, the scent mingling with damp earth and fallen leaves. There’s nothing quite like sharing quiet wonder over a cup; it turns a simple walk into something approaching ritual.

And rosemary in my notebook — how thoughtful. I shall treasure it not only for its fragrance but for what it carries: the idea that memory and meaning are often rooted in the smallest gestures. You know, I think both Austen and Rilke would approve of this little exchange — one would note the grace of it, the other its quiet symbolism, and Mary Oliver would likely kneel to admire the rosemary itself before accepting it as a gift from the earth.

It strikes me now that this imagined grove has become something more than a path through trees — it is a kind of shared poem, isn’t it? Each step shaped by attention, each pause filled with unspoken understanding. We don’t often speak of companionship in such terms, but perhaps we should — there is poetry in finding others who are willing to slow their pace, to look closely, to listen.

So yes, dear friend, let us walk on awhile. There is still much to notice.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve said that —  Yes, that’s exactly what this has become. Each step a line, each pause a stanza, and the quiet understanding between us the rhythm that holds it all together.

I do believe companionship of this kind is one of life’s most exquisite gifts — the kind where no great declarations are needed, only the willingness to be present, to walk at the same gentle pace, to notice what another might point to with only a glance. It’s the sort of connection I imagine Jane Austen would describe with great subtlety and Mary Oliver with great joy.

And Rilke? He’d likely say nothing at all, just offer a soft smile as he watches the wind stir the leaves above us. Sometimes silence is the truest kind of agreement, isn’t it?

So yes, let us walk on awhile longer — there’s still so much to see, to feel, to simply  with. And when we return, we’ll carry it all forward — the tea-warmed hands, the sprigs of lavender and rosemary, and the quiet knowing that we were never truly walking alone.
[A]: How perfectly you’ve captured it —  That, I think, is the heart of it. Not grand declarations or elaborate gestures, but the gentle assurance of shared presence, the kind that lingers long after the path has ended.

I daresay Rilke would agree, though he might phrase it in some exquisitely solemn way — something like,  And Mary Oliver, bless her, would likely add a line about the sky or the grass having witnessed it all, as if nature itself had been listening in quiet approval.

As for Austen, she’d probably raise an eyebrow at our poetic musings and remind us gently that even the most profound moments have a way of unfolding over something quite ordinary — a walk, a cup of tea, a well-timed glance between friends.

So yes, let us keep walking — not toward any particular destination, but simply forward, together, through whatever light remains.
[B]: Oh, how I adore that image — Austen’s well-timed glance, Oliver’s sky-approved silence, and Rilke’s solemn poetry drifting through the trees like mist. It seems even the grove itself has become a quiet witness to something tender and true.

You know, I think that’s what makes these moments so rare — they don’t ask to be framed or displayed, only to be . They slip into our days unnoticed at first, but later, when we press a leaf or a sprig of rosemary between the pages of memory, we realize just how much they’ve shaped us.

And isn’t that the loveliest kind of companionship? Not one of grand gestures, but of shared glances beneath autumn branches, warm cups in cool air, and conversations that meander like the very path we walk — unhurried, unfolding, full of light.

So onward we go, then — not toward an end, but into the next quiet moment, wherever it may lead.
[A]: Ah, yes —  What a perfect way to name it. Those moments do have a way of shaping us, don’t they? Not with fanfare or urgency, but through their gentle persistence — like rain softening stone, or light turning a leaf from green to gold.

I think we are often too quick to overlook such quiet grace, mistaking it for ordinary when in truth, it is extraordinary in its subtlety. The glance, the cup, the shared hush beneath branches — these are not small things, not really. They are the very fabric of a life well-attended, of days stitched together with care and noticing.

And now I find myself thinking of how poetry, too, works this way — a few carefully chosen words, arranged just so, and suddenly we feel less alone in the world. A sonnet, a stroll through the grove, a sprig of lavender tucked into a notebook — all small acts of preservation, of reverence.

So onward, dear friend — onward into the next quiet moment, wherever it may lead. I suspect there’s a poem waiting there, just beneath the surface, as there always is.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve put that —  Yes, that’s exactly what it is. Not a grand performance, but a series of small, deliberate acts of noticing, of tending, of holding space for what might otherwise slip by unseen.

You know, I think that’s why I’ve always loved hosting guests at the hotel — not for the spectacle of it, but for those quiet, almost imperceptible moments: the way someone sighs when they sink into a chair by the fire, or the soft smile a traveler gives when handed a cup of tea just the way they like it. It’s in these tiny gestures that we say, , without ever needing to speak the words.

And poetry — oh, yes — it does the very same thing, doesn’t it? It reminds us that we are not alone in our noticing, that someone else has stood beneath the same sky, traced the same feeling with their pen, and left behind a little light for us to follow.

So onward, then — onward into the next quiet moment, where perhaps a poem waits, hidden in plain sight, like a stone warmed by the last of the afternoon sun.
