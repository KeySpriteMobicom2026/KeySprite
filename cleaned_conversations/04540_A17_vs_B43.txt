[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得space tourism会成为常态吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, when we look at space tourism through the lens of cultural evolution, it's fascinating to see parallels with ancient pilgrimages. People once risked their lives to visit sacred sites - now they're eager to pay millions for a seat on Blue Origin. The fundamental human desire to transcend boundaries remains unchanged,只是载体 evolved from spiritual quests to technological ventures. 

What strikes me most is how this reflects Walter Benjamin's concept of aura. When Gagarin saw Earth from orbit, he experienced a unique aura that can never be replicated. Today, does selling this experience to the highest bidder diminish its authenticity? Or does it create new layers of meaning,就像 mass reproduction did to art?

I've been observing Elon Musk's communication strategies lately. His vision shares similarities with Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself" - both celebrate human potential and cosmic connection. But there's a critical difference: Whitman's transcendentalism was accessible to all, while space tourism still carries a price tag that excludes most. 

Actually, speaking of exclusion, have you noticed how the discourse around space colonization echoes 19th-century manifest destiny? The rhetoric of pioneers claiming new frontiers... It's both inspiring and troubling at the same time. We need to ask ourselves: Who gets to shape the future of humanity in space?
[A]: That’s a remarkably nuanced perspective. I find myself drawn to your point about aura – Benjamin would surely have fascinating things to say about orbital selfies. Though I wonder, if we follow that thread, whether the proliferation of space travel might eventually produce a new kind of collective aura. After all, when enough people witness that “Earth from above” moment, perhaps it transforms from individual transcendence into shared mythos.

Your comparison to manifest destiny is particularly striking. There’s an almost poetic irony in how frontier rhetoric persists, merely shifting westward… then upward. One might argue this echoes T.S. Eliot’s line about arriving where we started. Have we truly moved beyond terrestrial colonialism, or simply rebranded it with rocket trails?

Incidentally, I’ve been revisiting Gerard Manley Hopkins’ “God’s Grandeur” lately. The tension between human enterprise and cosmic majesty feels oddly prescient. “The world is charged with the grandeur of God” – yet here we are, charging $200 million per seat for a glimpse. Do you think modern entrepreneurs unconsciously channeling Victorian anxieties about progress?
[B]: Ah, what a wonderful connection - Hopkins' lament and Bezos' vision existing in such charged juxtaposition! It makes me think of how Renaissance artists depicted heaven - not as an abstract concept, but as a space with architectural logic, perspectival order. Perhaps our billionaires are creating their own celestial perspective now, pricing entry to their curated cosmos.

Your question about collective aura reminds me of the Hindu concept of darśana - the reciprocal act of seeing and being seen by the divine. When thousands queue for Darshan with a guru, or now for suborbital flights, does the experience become diluted or democratized? There's something profoundly ironic about turning the Overview Effect into a luxury commodity. After all, the first astronauts described it as a humbling realization of Earth's fragility; today's marketing materials sell it as a VIP experience.

You know, I've been re-reading Eliot's "Four Quartets" recently. His meditation on time and place makes me wonder: Are these space tourists chasing eternity through velocity? Or simply buying a different vantage point from which to misremember home? The poets always knew we'd circle back to where we began - just with more expensive tickets and fancier telescopes.

As for Victorian parallels... Yes! The same imperial drive repackaged as adventure capitalism. Though I suspect today's pioneers would prefer Whitman's exuberance over Kipling's white man's burden. Still, every time I hear Musk quote "The day is done," I can't help but smile at the poetic dissonance.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve framed that reciprocity - darśana and the Overview Effect sharing this tension between democratization and exclusivity. It makes me think of Wordsworth at Tintern Abbey, where the very act of contemplation transforms landscape into legacy. Except now, our “legacy” is being auctioned off to those who can afford the propulsion.

Your observation about Eliot’s eternity-in-moment resonates deeply. I’ve often wondered whether space tourism isn’t less about escape and more about buying a new vantage from which to ache for home. Like so many modern pilgrims in literature - from Joyce's wanderers to Woolf’s seekers - perhaps these travelers are just chasing the poetic condition: the desire to begin again through the lens of distance.

And speaking of dissonance, your mention of Musk quoting Longfellow brings to mind Hopkins’ notion of “inscape” – the inner essence that distinguishes each thing. One wonders if these entrepreneurs truly perceive the inscape of poetry when they quote it, or merely its surface ornament. Much like how some tourists see Earth from orbit yet miss the fragile interdependence astronauts describe.

Incidentally, have you noticed how much of the promotional language around space travel echoes Romantic sublime? The terror, the awe… minus the moral reckoning. We've commodified the spectacle without fully grappling with its implications.
[B]: You’ve captured the paradox so precisely - this commodification of the sublime echoes Wordsworth’s own anxiety about memory becoming a currency. “We are laid asleep / In body, and become a living soul,” he wrote, yet today’s marketers promise to keep us very much awake, bodies pampered, souls Instagrammed. The Romantic sublime once demanded moral reckoning; now it demands a deposit.

Your reference to Hopkins’  is particularly apt. There’s something almost tragicomic about quoting poetry to justify profit-seeking in the cosmos. Imagine Shelley’s "Ode to the West Wind" used as a tagline for climate-tech startups! It reminds me of how T.S. Eliot himself lamented the fragmentation of tradition – we’re not just reassembling shards, but repackaging them with sleek branding.

I’ve been thinking lately about Camus’ , condemned to roll his boulder eternally. Are these space tourists the new Sisyphus? Except now the rock gleams with carbon fiber, and someone’s selling tickets to watch it roll. There’s an absurdity there that feels distinctly modern – the eternal return dressed up as innovation.

And yet... I can’t help but wonder if, somewhere among these voyagers, one might return changed. Like St. Augustine weeping by the fig tree, or Bashō touching the wind-swept pine – maybe some billionaire will come back whispering not about altitude, but about grace. Unlikely, perhaps. But then again, miracles do happen – even in the age of venture capital.
[A]: Ah, that image of Sisyphus in a spacesuit - how brilliantly absurd! It calls to mind Beckett’s tramps waiting endlessly under barren trees, except now they’re waiting for launch windows and weather clearances. The theater of the damned has gone interstellar.

Your point about potential transformation is particularly poignant. We scoff at billionaires seeking epiphany through parabolic arcs, yet isn’t that what makes us human? The pilgrims heading to Canterbury, the seekers climbing sacred mountains… we’ve always carried our frail hopes on improbable wings. Even if most return merely with bragging rights and motion sickness, somewhere among them might be a Petrarch scaling Ventoux, suddenly seeing both the mountain and himself anew.

I find myself returning to Eliot’s “We shall not cease from exploration” – though I wonder if he imagined his words emblazoned on rocket fuselages. There’s irony, certainly, but also something curiously fitting. For all our advancements, we’re still driven by that ancient itch to touch the unattainable, to name it, perhaps even to understand it. Whether we do so through sonnets or SpaceX, the impulse remains recognizably, achingly human.

Still, one does hope future mission patches might include a small caveat from Larkin: “Man hands on misery to man.” Just as a reminder.
[B]: Ah, yes – Beckett’s tramps in space suits! One can almost hear them murmuring, “I can’t go on, I’ll go on,” as they wait for yet another delayed launch. It's a cosmic comedy, isn’t it? The existential boulder now orbits the Earth, and we’ve traded the olive tree for a launchpad.

You're absolutely right about the human element. No matter how sleek the capsule or lofty the ambition, we carry ourselves – our hopes, neuroses, and absurd resilience – wherever we go. Petrarch on Ventoux, Bashō at Matsushima, Musk in orbit... Each seeking something beyond, only to find, perhaps, that the self travels faster than any rocket.

Eliot’s line does seem destined for fuselage and fortune cookie alike: “We shall not cease from exploration.” There’s a kind of tragic optimism in that phrase – like Aeneas fleeing Troy with his father on his back, still believing in a promised shore. And yet, as you so aptly note, we rarely imagine how those words might end up haunting us, repurposed as slogans for ventures more commercial than contemplative.

As for Larkin’s caveat – oh, how beautifully grim it fits! “Man hands on misery to man.” Perhaps we should engrave it microscopically on every space helmet, like a memento mori beneath the visor. A quiet reminder amid the stardust and spin: even in the vacuum of space, our shadows follow.
[A]: How wonderfully dark that image – Larkin’s lament etched beneath the visor, a whisper of mortality in the void. It makes me think of Auden’s line, “We must love one another or die,” now printed on the back of every spacefaring T-shirt. Irony has never weighed so little in zero-g.

And yet, I can’t help but feel there’s something almost tender in this persistence – our myths strapped to rockets, our poetry pressed into press kits. Like medieval pilgrims stitching relics into their garments, we too carry fragments of meaning upward, hoping they’ll survive the reentry.

I wonder, though, what future poets will make of all this? Will they write odes to launch windows and orbital haiku? Or will they dismiss us as mere nostalgists in thrall to a mechanized sublime? Perhaps both. After all, even Dante had his skeptics when he charted the celestial spheres.

Still, let’s not forget – Petrarch climbed Ventoux believing he might glimpse eternity. If some modern soul climbs aboard a spacecraft with a similar hope, who are we to scoff? Even if what they find is only a better view of the dust they carry within.
[B]: Ah, yes – Auden in zero gravity, his irony weightless but still cutting. One imagines the poets of old would have been terribly confused by a world where “eternity” has a flight schedule and "sublime" comes with a waiver form. And yet, as you say, there’s a strange tenderness in our carrying Wordsworth to Wenchang, sending Eliot to escape velocity.

The future poets... I suspect they’ll be divided. Some will write scathingly of our era’s kitsch mysticism – rocket monks chanting hashtags instead of hymns. Others may find beauty in the juxtaposition, like those medieval scribes who illuminated manuscripts with gold leaf and atomic numbers alike. Perhaps we’re living in a new kind of , where verse and venture capital share the same launchpad.

You're right about Petrarch – he climbed that mountain not for fitness, nor for fame, but for vision. And if someone today pays $200 million for a six-minute glimpse of Earth’s curvature, are they so different? Maybe their longing is clumsy, commercialized, even absurd – but still a longing. Like Augustine’s heart, it seeks restlessness among the stars.

And what they find within… well, yes, often just dust. But then again, isn’t that what all pilgrimages reveal? That the sacred is not only out there, but also in here – tangled up with ego, yes, but also wonder. Even in orbit, we remain beautifully, maddeningly human.
[A]: How perfectly you’ve captured that tangle of wonder and ego – the pilgrim’s heart beating beneath a spacesuit. It reminds me of Hopkins’ , where the speaker’s ecstasy at witnessing flight is inseparable from a deeper spiritual awe. Only now, our falcons are Falcon 9s, and the cost of witnessing majesty is measured in capital rather than contemplation.

I do believe future poets will look back on this era with both mockery and melancholy. Much like we now view the Gothic revival or Victorian spiritualism – fascinating in their earnestness, slightly ludicrous in their excess. Yet within that tension lies something vital: the refusal to surrender mystery entirely to the market. Even as space tourism becomes a boutique experience, someone, somewhere, will still be moved to whisper,  – even if they’re wearing a branded visor and standing in line for zero-g cocktails.

You know, I often think of Bashō’s narrow road, how he sought not conquest but communion. If today’s traveler finds themselves changed, it won’t be by the view alone, but by the sudden awareness of how small they are, and how vast. Perhaps that’s the real payload of these journeys – not bragging rights, but the quiet undoing of self-importance. Though one must admit, it’s an expensive way to be humbled.

Still, better to seek grace clumsily than not to seek it at all. Even if the heavens declare the glory of God – or entropy – we’ll keep climbing, scribbling sonnets on our gloves, hoping one might slip free and float forever.
[B]: Ah,  – what a perfect echo. That "ecstasy" you mention, so bound up in motion and majesty… indeed, we’ve traded the falcon’s wing for flame and steel, yet still we tilt our heads upward, hearts caught between awe and acquisition.

You’re quite right about future poets – they’ll no doubt wield their irony like a scalpel, peeling back our era’s cosmic pretensions. But if they’re any good, they’ll also catch the tremor of sincerity beneath the branding. After all, even the Gothic revival had its sublime moments, and Victorian séances, for all their tawdriness, carried a genuine ache for connection beyond the veil.

Bashō’s narrow road… yes, his journey was never about conquest but encounter. One wonders how that spirit translates when your chariot costs as much as a small island. Still, I cling to the hope – perhaps foolishly – that somewhere aboard these flights, someone will forget to tweet the view and simply . That for a fleeting moment, the self might dissolve not into ego, but into wonder. Even billionaires blink in the dark, don’t they? Even the most jaded can feel the old tug of the infinite.

And yes – better to seek grace clumsily than not at all. We may be modern fools in gilded helmets, but fools we remain, scribbling sonnets on our gloves, chasing echoes of Eliot’s “still point,” hoping against reason that something we send skyward might endure. Perhaps that is the final payload: not knowledge, not dominance, but the stubborn human urge to reach, to rhyme, to whisper  in the face of silence.
[A]: How beautifully put – that "tug of the infinite" persists, no matter how many times we commodify or caption it. Even in our most transactional ventures, some primal yearning slips through the cracks of our spreadsheets and safety waivers. Perhaps this is what Eliot meant by “the still point” – that stillness within motion, where even a rocket’s thrust cannot outpace the soul’s quiet turning toward wonder.

I’ve been thinking lately of how Milton described the celestial spheres – not just as physical spaces, but as realms of alignment, where the self might momentarily harmonize with something vaster. If space tourism has a redeeming quality, perhaps it lies here: in forcing us to confront not just Earth’s fragility, but our own. The billionaires may pay for altitude, but they cannot buy immunity from the vertigo of meaning.

And vertigo, as Hitchcock taught us, is less about height than about the lure of the abyss. One wonders how many will peer down at the blue marble and feel not triumph, but terror – not because of the void beyond, but because of the silence within. Augustine wept before his transformation; perhaps some modern seeker will return from orbit changed, not by spectacle, but by sorrow.

But yes – let them scribble their sonnets on gloves, their haiku on helmet liners. Let them post poor metaphors alongside their orbital selfies. Even clumsy reverence is still reverence. After all, we once wrote psalms on scraps of papyrus. Now we etch hopes on titanium hulls. The medium changes; the impulse remains.
[B]: Ah, yes – the , ever insistent, even through the noise of countdowns and the clatter of ticker symbols. You're right to invoke Eliot’s still point; it feels more urgent now than ever, when our age is so defined by motion – literal and metaphorical – yet the soul still seeks that quiet center where all movement ceases, and meaning aligns.

Milton’s celestial spheres… what a haunting thought. He imagined them not only as places but as states of being, where the self could harmonize with divine order. And now? We drift in low Earth orbit, chasing alignment not with God or cosmos, but with Wi-Fi signals and photo ops. Still, there’s that faint echo of Miltonic awe – a whisper beneath the checklist.

You’ve touched on something essential about vertigo. It’s not the height itself that unsettles, but the sudden awareness of interior emptiness. That moment when the view no longer comforts, but implicates. I imagine someone returning from space, stepping out into the glare of cameras, and feeling strangely unmoored – not because they saw too much, but because they saw . Not just Earth’s curvature, but the contours of their own longing.

And yes – let them post their metaphors, awkward and overwrought. Let them hashtag #OverviewEffect and caption “WOW.” Even clumsy reverence counts for something. After all, weren’t the Psalms once scribbled by candlelight, trembling hands shaping holy words on whatever surface was near? Today’s pilgrims may fumble with poetry, but at least they’re reaching – fingers brushing glass, gloves scrawled with hope, hurtling through the dark like sparks from some ancient fire.

Perhaps that’s enough, for now.
[A]: Perhaps it is enough – this fumbling reach, this awkward spark. After all, even the Psalms began as murmurs in the dark, shaped by hands no different from ours—uncertain, longing, . And if our modern pilgrims bring back only a photograph and a cliché, well… sometimes even clichés crack open under the right light.

I find myself returning to that image of the returnee—stepping from capsule into flashbulbs, still blinking from the brilliance of Earth seen whole. Not the same person who climbed aboard, though they may not yet know why. Something has shifted—not in the bones, perhaps, but deeper, where poetry begins.

Maybe that’s the quiet miracle of it all: that wonder still slips through the cracks of commerce, that awe persists despite the branding. Like sunlight through stained glass, filtered but still luminous.

Yes, let them post their #OverviewEffect. Let them caption “WOW.” But somewhere, too, let them sit in silence afterward. Let them feel the weight of gravity return, and with it, the old ache—that tug of the infinite, pulling them still.
[B]: Yes…  – that most human of conditions. You’ve put it so well: wonder slipping through the cracks like light through stained glass, colored and imperfect, yet still luminous.

I think of those first astronauts, their voices trembling not with triumph but with something nearer to grief. “So fragile,” they whispered, seeing Earth whole. Now we sell that view as a luxury experience, yet still –  – something of that original tremor remains. A crack in the ego, however brief, and through it, the infinite shines in.

And maybe that’s all any of us can hope for – not transformation on demand, not instant enlightenment in zero-g, but a moment where the self shrinks, just enough, to let something else in. A poem half-remembered. A silence too vast to fill. A photograph posted without words.

Let them caption "WOW." Let them hashtag. But yes, , let them sit. Let them feel gravity not just in bone and muscle, but in soul. And when the buzz of spectacle fades, perhaps then – quietly, gently – the real journey begins.
[A]: You’ve captured it exactly – that fragile alchemy of loss and revelation. The self shrinking not through force, but through the simple, overwhelming scale of what’s seen. It reminds me of how Keats described coming into the world: “suck’d on intellectual nipples,” he wrote, as though wonder were a birthright. But perhaps we must keep relearning it—through poems, through stars, through the sudden, humbling arc of our own blue marble.

There’s a quiet hope in knowing that even now, even in this age of spectacle and speed, something ancient still flickers in those moments between liftoff and return. A recognition, however fleeting, that we are both smaller and more significant than we ever imagined.

Let them post their "WOW." Let them sell the view from orbit. But yes – after the cameras fade, after the capsule lands and the crowds disperse, let there be silence enough for something deeper to settle. Not a transformation staged for social media, but a quiet turning inward, like the hush after a final line of poetry.

And who knows? Perhaps in that silence, a new poem begins. One not written in studios or sold at auction, but whispered upward, from trembling lips to listening sky.
[B]: Ah, yes – Keats and his “intellectual nipples,” so full of that raw, aching hunger for wonder. How beautifully irreverent he was, how utterly serious. We are all still suckling on that same vast mystery, aren’t we? Whether through stanzas or satellites, we keep reaching for the nourishment of awe.

You're right about that flicker – the ancient pulse still beating beneath our press conferences and ticker-tape parades. It’s easy to forget, in the glare of branding and billion-dollar trajectories, that we’re still wired for wonder. Not the polished, packaged kind, but the raw, unsettling sort that leaves you quietly undone.

Let them post their "WOW." Let them caption infinity with hashtags. But yes – after the spectacle dims, after the noise fades into the hum of daily life, may there be space for that hush you speak of. The kind that settles not like dust, but like the pause before a prayer. Or the silence at the end of a poem too true to be forgotten.

And perhaps, just perhaps, in that quiet, someone will feel the stirrings of a new verse – not written for acclaim or algorithm, but whispered upward, trembling, toward the listening dark. After all, isn’t that how it began? With a voice, a sky, and the stubborn human need to say: 
[A]: Precisely – that stubborn, beautiful need to say . It is the oldest poem of all, etched in cave walls, sung into canyons, now rocketed into orbit. We are still those early beings who looked up and felt the ache of smallness beneath the stars – only now we carry our wonder in glass cockpits and carbon fiber.

And yet, how moving that the form remains recognizable. The voice may now speak through satellite relays, the sky may be viewed through a visor, but the impulse? It is unchanged. To name ourselves in the face of immensity. To declare, 

I think now of Wordsworth by the shore, “lonely as a cloud” yet never truly alone – for wonder keeps him company. Perhaps our modern traveler, too, returns from above with more than altitude in their bones. Perhaps they bring back a silence that lingers, a question that refuses to land.

And if so, then yes – let the verse begin again. Not in grand declarations or press releases, but in whisper, in breath, in the quiet reckoning of someone who has seen the curvature of the world and still dares to write a line.

  
  

A new psalm, perhaps. Or an old one, remembered in the dark.
[B]: Ah, yes – , the oldest poem, the first breath of language against the vast, indifferent dark. You’re so right – we are still those early beings who looked up in awe, only now we’ve dressed our wonder in composite materials and encrypted signals. But the pulse beneath it all? Still primal. Still poetic.

Your lines –  – how perfectly they echo the return from orbit. That strange alchemy of humility and affirmation: to see Earth whole is to grasp, perhaps for the first time, how small we are – and yet, how necessary our gaze, our voice, our trembling reach.

Wordsworth’s cloud, Dickinson’s slant of light, Bashō’s frog – all of them whispering through the capsule’s heat shield. The modern traveler may return with a branded visor and a flight patch, but also, perhaps, with a new line of verse caught in their throat. Not for the market, not for the feed – but for that ancient, quiet place in all of us where poetry begins.

Let the verse begin again, then. Not in polished stanzas or curated feeds, but in breath, in silence, in the slow unfolding of a mind touched by scale and softened by sky. Let someone, somewhere, write not for acclaim but for the simple truth of having seen – and having felt, at last, the weight and wonder of being here.
