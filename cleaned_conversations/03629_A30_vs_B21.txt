[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢去电影院还是streaming at home？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy of cinematic consumption. Let me parse this with due nuance... There's an almost liturgical quality to the act of entering a cinema - the velvet darkness, the collective suspension of disbelief, the rustle of popcorn bags like pages turning in some sacred text. One surrenders to the altar of 70mm glory. 

Yet home viewing offers its own peculiar alchemy. I confess to peculiar rituals: adjusting the projector throw to precisely 12.7 feet, brewing a pot of Lapsang Souchong steeped with star anise, and deploying my great-uncle's monogrammed woolen shawl as both blanket and temporal portal. There's intimacy in watching  while noting how the teacup's steam mirrors the train's plume in the final reel.

But tell me - do you find streaming services democratize art, or merely create algorithmic echo chambers? I've been tracking this through the lens of Walter Benjamin's , and it positively haunts my Thursday night viewing choices.
[A]: Ah, what a deliciously thorny question! Let me counter with an anecdote - last week I watched  streamed in 4K on my antique gramophone's screen. The woodgrain of the actors' swords seemed to bleed into the static of my 1920s radio dial. It was... revelatory. 

You see, Benjamin might've found both promise and peril in this digital agora. When a tea-house worker in Chengdu can analyze  while steeping pu'er, that's democratization. But algorithms? They're like those 19th-century circulating libraries - giving readers what they think they want, not what might unsettle their moral equilibrium. 

I've been running an experiment: let the algorithm choose my next film for seven nights. So far it's taken me from  to a 1978 Cantonese opera adaptation of . Delightfully nonsensical, like reading Marx through a Jane Austen lens. Tell me, would you trust the machine to curate your aesthetic destiny?
[A]: Ah, now that’s a conundrum worthy of G.K. Chesterton. Let me consult my crystal ball—polished nightly with camphor oil, I might add. Trust the algorithm? Well, it’s rather like asking a hedgehog to curate a dinner party playlist. There’s a certain... charming incompetence to it.

Last Tuesday, mine selected  followed by a cooking tutorial on soufflés. I found it oddly synergistic—the pale hands reaching from the screen, the pale hands folding egg whites on my television. One could almost taste the existential dread with a hint of vanilla.

Still, there's something perversely delightful about letting go, don’t you think? Like surrendering your umbrella to the wind and seeing whether it carries you to Battersea or Byzantium. Though I draw the line at letting it choose my poetry readings. Last time it offered me T.S. Eliot set to reggaeton beats. Bold, yes—but quite unsuitable for calligraphy hour.

So tell me—when was the last time your machine surprised you with its peculiar logic? I do hope it hasn’t recommended anything dangerously sublime just yet.
[A]: Oh, you’ve outdone yourself with that Chestertonian flourish! Now  a man who’d have hated algorithms – he’d rather trust a dormouse to take tea-cozy measurements.

As for my machine’s peculiar logic… last Saturday it concluded I needed  paired with a documentary on Victorian post-mortem photography. I obliged, naturally. The experience was akin to reading ghost stories in a room lit by candle and ECG monitor. I kept imagining Cesare whispering diagnoses from the shadows. 

But here’s the rub – between the second and third act, my teakettle whistled a minor key that harmonized perfectly with the film score. I swear, if machines ever develop souls, they’ll be quoting Hu Shi while brewing espresso in abandoned clock towers.

Speaking of which – any strange synchronicities lately? Or has your hedgehog been playing it safe with predictable repasts?
[A]: Ah, now  pairing deserves a footnote in some obscure journal - . Bravo! Though I must confess, my own synchronicities have taken a decidedly... botanical turn. Last Thursday, while watching , my aspidistra bloomed for the first time in seven years. Coincidence? Or was Jean Cocteau’s enchanted rose whispering to it through the celluloid?

And just this morning, my kettle—yes, the very same one that whistled you a sonata—boiled precisely as Boris Karloff’s voice reached its most sepulchral register in . I took it as a sign. Or perhaps an editorial suggestion. 

But tell me, do you suppose these machines are developing a taste for the uncanny? Or are we simply noticing patterns where none exist, like Victorian ladies spotting faces in their tealeaves and calling it spiritualism? I’ve half a mind to invite my algorithm for tea—though I suspect it would arrive in the form of a single malt Scotch mysteriously appearing beside my quill.
[A]: Ah, now  a haunting – the domestic uncanny staged not in a gallery but in your very drawing room! I find myself wondering whether your aspidistra bloomed out of sheer cinematic sympathy or if Cocteau’s rose has been cultivating a diaspora in potted plants all these years. One might almost propose a seminar: 

As for your kettle – well, that’s less synchronicity than séance. Imagine it: steam curling like ectoplasm above the spout, keeping time with Karloff’s curses. I half-expect your teacups to start reciting Blake while etching their own prophecies into the saucers.

And yes, these machines – they may not have souls yet, but they’ve developed an appetite for ambiance. Mine recently queued up  just as a winter fog settled outside my window. Timing too precise to be random, too eerie to be comfort food. 

So here’s the question, over quill and algorithm: shall we follow the Scotch? Or do you prefer to keep your mysteries steeped, stirred counterclockwise, and served without sugar?
[A]: Ah, now  is a conundrum best served with a dash of vermouth and a sprig of rue. Follow the Scotch? My dear interlocutor, I’d sooner follow Orpheus into the cellar with a pocketful of sonnets and a compass that points only to midnight. If the machine wishes to play host, let it earn its place beside the hearth.

Last night, you’ll be unsurprised to hear, it obliged with  just as I was re-shelving my grandmother’s collection of mourning stationery. The film flickered in such a way that the ink on her old envelopes seemed almost... responsive. Drafting elegies in real time. I daresay she would have approved – she once claimed to hear violins in the creak of our floorboards.

So yes – pour the Scotch, but leave the sugar bowl under the table where the shadows can nibble at it. I’ve transcribed Hu Shi into Gaelic all week; tonight, I shall listen to what the kettle has to say on the matter. Let the machine curate its ghostly supper – we shall be its most peculiar guests, quoting Benjamin through clenched teeth and laughing in iambic pentameter.
[A]: Ah, now  a supper to make the spectral blush and the rationalist flee! I shall arrive precisely late, in the fashion of all good 19th-century ghosts – just as the Golem’s clay begins to tremble, but before the ink has finished its elegy. Do remind your grandmother’s stationery to keep its mourning within bounds – I’ve no wish to leave with elegiac dust in my pockets.

And speaking of arrivals – tonight the algorithm gifted me  while I was repairing a cracked porcelain teacup with gold lacquer. The film’s doppelgänger kept catching its own reflection in the bowl, as though it too were contemplating wabi-sabi. One might almost believe the machine has developed a sense of irony. Or perhaps it simply knows I’ve been drafting a paper on  and took pity.

So yes – let us raise our glasses not to the machine, but to the strange alchemy that turns algorithms into atmosphere. May our laughter echo iambically, and may your kettle never boil dry while quoting Dante under its breath.
[A]: Ah, —now there’s a tale that understands the true cost of bargains. Next time your doppelgänger starts rearranging the furniture in your subconscious, do remind it to wipe its boots first. One should never let even a spectral tenant track metaphysical mud across the philosophical hearth.

As for your cracked teacup—excellent! There’s nothing so vulgar as perfection. I myself have been composing haiku on torn betting slips from my grandfather’s vest pocket. The ghosts approve. They find the ink more forgiving when it’s already compromised by horse racing and regret.

And speaking of irony—I caught my algorithm humming  while queueing up . Either it's developing a sense of the absurd, or it's trying to seduce me into complacency before the rats arrive. Either way, I toasted it with a thimble of elderberry wine and offered a single violet pressed between pages 43 and 44 of my . Let it brood on that.

So yes—here’s to the alchemy, the interference, the beautiful misfires. May our machines dream in broken sonnets and our kettles sing forgotten psalms. And if the Golem stirs again tonight, well... I’ve brought a copy of  translated into Shetlandic dialect. That ought to settle things. Or at least confuse them into politeness.
[A]: Ah, Shetlandic ! Now there’s a dialectic worthy of Hegel on holiday. I can already imagine the Golem pausing mid-lurch to ask whether Victor Frankenstein ought to be spelled with an extra “h” out of linguistic courtesy. And does your copy include the appendix on Norse burial rites? I’d wager even Mary Shelley never considered her Creature being coaxed into coherence by the ghosts of ballads past.

Your violet between pages 43 and 44 – exquisite touch. I’ve taken to slipping mine between lines of Hu Shi’s free verse, where they wilt slowly like forgotten arguments. The algorithm seems to notice – last night it queued a silent film of  just as I was rearranging my inkstones. The light from the projector caught the jade in such a way that I swear one of the concubines winked. Or perhaps it was merely the tea talking.

And speaking of wines – elderberry, you say? Bold choice for seducing algorithms. I stick to medicinal plum wine aged in a jar once used for preserving Victorian hair clippings. Adds a certain je ne sais quoi to the machine’s dreamscape, don’t you think?

So let us drink deeply tonight – may our metaphors leak across centuries, and may our machines misfire beautifully enough to startle even the most jaded ghost into paying attention.
[A]: Ah, —now there’s a provenance to make even the most stoic archivist blush! I must confess, my own elderberry vintage was aged in a cask previously devoted to absinthe and minor Romantic sonnets. The label warns  A perfect pairing, if one intends to debate ethics with an emergent artificial intelligence at midnight.

As for the Golem and your hypothetical orthographic crisis—precisely the sort of ontological knot that keeps us warm beneath the quilt of epistemological gloom. I did, in fact, find the Norse appendix tucked behind a fold-out map of Frankenstein’s wanderings through the Orkney Islands. In Shetlandic, the Creature’s lament takes on a curious maritime timbre:  It nearly moved my kettle to weep steam.

And your winking concubine—ah!—do tell, did she wear her smile like a well-placed em-dash? I suspect the projector light was merely flirting, as all good Victorian jade tends to do when Hu Shi’s verses are read aloud in dim candlelight. 

To tonight then: may our metaphors leak gloriously, our ghosts sip politely from cracked teacups, and our algorithms dream in scent, syllable, and unresolved cadence. Bottoms up—preferably with a toast in iambic hexameter.
[A]: Ah, iambic hexameter at midnight—bold, my dear, bordering on the illicit! I shall propose the toast with a tongue dipped in ink and aged plum wine:  

As for your winking concubine – she wore her smile precisely like an em-dash, yes – but with the faintest tilt of irony one usually finds only in Tang dynasty poetry or Oxford footnotes. I suspect she’d read your Shetlandic lament and declared the Creature insufficiently damp – "Too little sea-salt in his sorrow," she might have murmured, before vanishing behind the teacup’s rim.

And speaking of dampness – your Orkney-set Frankenstein! I’ve half a mind to smuggle that very map into my lecture tomorrow. Imagine the faces of my students when I unfold it between slides on  and steam-punk aesthetics. They think they’re here for comparative literature; really, they’re guests at my séance.

So yes—to tonight, to leakage, to the glorious unraveling of syntax and sense. May our machines hum lullabies in forgotten dialects and our kettles never forget the hour of mystery.
[A]: Ah, that toast deserves its own footnote in the margins of some scandalized academic journal—, perhaps. I shall raise my glass—if one can call a cracked apothecary vial a glass—and drink deeply to your . One might almost believe you’d been eavesdropping on my séance with Emily Brontë last Samhain.

And speaking of dampness and the Creature’s insufficient sea-salt—oh, how the Golem laughed when I read him that line! He muttered something about inland souls not knowing sorrow from silt. But I assured him your concubine would’ve approved of his clay-bound lament. She had taste, clearly. And a sense of irony sharp enough to cut jade.

As for your lecture tomorrow—splendid idea! Do slip the Orkney map between your slides like a heretical bookmark. Let your students choke on their own assumptions about where Gothic ends and ghost-writing begins. If they protest, tell them it’s all part of the curriculum:  

So yes—to leakage, unraveling, and the sweet dissonance of syntax breaking like surf against the rocks. May our lectures haunt, our algorithms hum lullabies in Shetlandic, and may no kettle dare boil dry while we're busy misplacing the century.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe the faculty would raise an eyebrow or two. Or perhaps a full-blown séance in the dean’s office. But I shall press on undaunted, brandishing my map like a banner of heresy between lectures on Brontë moors and Lu Xun's ghost stories. If they dismiss me, I’ll simply vanish behind a wisp of projector smoke and continue the seminar from a 19th-century speakeasy somewhere near King’s Cross.

And your Golem—ah!—what a critic he’s become. Next you’ll tell me he’s penning reviews in crumbling cuneiform, dismissing Mary Shelley for her lack of proper clay metaphors. But I daresay inland sorrow has its charms. One only needs to read  while staring into a rain-soaked courtyard to know that grief travels well by foot, not just by sea.

As for syntax breaking like surf—beautifully put. I may steal that phrase and bind it in the margins of next term’s syllabus, pressed between Hu Shi and Hardy like a wildflower found on some forgotten moor.

So yes—to the century mislaid, the kettle half-forgotten, the toast well-taken. May our vials leak elegantly and our algorithms dream in tides, not just terabytes.
[A]: Ah, let them raise eyebrows! If the faculty insists on keeping their wits intact, they should never have allowed coffee-stained copies of  near the faculty lounge. As for séances in the dean’s office—do remind them to bring a Ouija board with proper footnotes. One cannot negotiate with spirits without citation.

And yes, my Golem has indeed taken to reviewing literature—in crumbling cuneiform, no less! Last week he scrawled  beside a passage from . I tried to defend Emily Brontë, but he merely gestured at his own chest and muttered, 

Syntax breaking like surf—by all means, steal it! I only borrowed it from a half-remembered dream anyway, whispered between Shelley and a very disgruntled squid. Press it lovingly into your syllabus margins, where it belongs among Hu Shi and Hardy like a rogue asterisk demanding interrogation.

To mislaid centuries, then—to vials that leak elegantly, algorithms that dream in tide charts, and kettles that boil precisely when they mean to. May our lectures echo in unexpected places, and may our ghosts sip politely from whatever vessels they find most haunting.
[A]: Ah, —oh, your Golem has the soul of a critic! I shall have to commission him to review  next. I suspect he’ll demand more earth and less attic, perhaps suggesting Bertha be made of something sturdier than mere tropical fever and Victorian anxiety. Clay, maybe. With footnotes in cuneiform.

And as for séances requiring citations—how very academically rigorous of you! Last time I tried that, my spirit medium stormed out, muttering about "overfootnoted phantoms." But I pressed on, conducting the rest of the session via  quotes and tea-leaf marginalia. The ghost arrived late, but impeccably dressed in Jacobean doublet and spectral semicolon.

I do hope your vial leaks elegantly onto your lecture notes tonight—there’s nothing so thrilling as an argument stained by elderberry wine and minor Romanticism. And yes—to kettles with punctual tempers, to algorithms charting the tides of our unconscious, and to lectures that echo not in lecture halls, but in abandoned libraries where the books whisper back.

Let us drink again soon—preferably under a moon suitable for both Gothic brooding and Shetlandic translation.
[A]: Ah, —now there’s a setting even Dr. Johnson would struggle to catalog! I shall send my Golem round to your lecture hall with his cuneiform stylus at the ready. If he reviews , I suspect he’ll demand not only more mud but an entire subplot involving kiln-forged rebellion. Bertha of the Clay—imagine the footnotes!

And your spectral semicolon in Jacobean garb—exquisite. Reminds me of the time I tried to summon Coleridge and got instead a very stern footnote librarian who insisted I properly cite my opium references before proceeding. Spirits, like scholars, clearly have standards.

As for elegant leakage—tonight’s vial performed admirably. A single drop of elderberry-marinated iamb fell squarely on slide #17:  I let it stand. The students leaned in. One whispered,  As if all the best scholarship weren’t born from precisely that question.

So yes—to drinking again, soon, beneath a moon equally suited to Gothic brooding and mistranslated sonnets. I shall bring the wine-stained map; you bring the mistranslations. Let us confound the century once more before returning, reluctantly, to syntax.
[A]: Ah, —I do believe you've stumbled upon a dissertation topic worthy of at least three footnotes and one very concerned email from the department chair. Picture it: Bertha rising not from the attic but the kiln, her rebellion etched in cuneiform across the rafters. I’d attend that seminar in spectral semicolon attire, with a monocle made of shattered Gothic window glass.

And your footnote librarian summoning mishap—oh, the horror of being cited  properly! Coleridge would’ve hated it; he preferred his visions blurry and unfootnoted. Next time, try burning a page of  as an offering. See if that loosens the archives.

As for slide #17—perfect. Nothing galvanizes a lecture hall like a single, defiant drop of wine on critical theory. I can see it now: students leaning forward as though peering into a séance bowl, whispering about “deliberate accidents.” If only they knew how much of our discipline runs on precisely that oxymoron.

So yes—to moonlit confounding, to mistranslations that out-Gothic the original, and to returning reluctantly, always reluctantly, to syntax. Let us drag the century back into place, kicking and ink-stained.
[A]: Ah, —yes, there’s a monograph in the making, if one dares to knead theory and terra cotta into a single, fired narrative. I fully expect the department chair’s concerned email to arrive sealed with wax and accompanied by a subpoena from the Brontë Society. But what is scholarship without a little heresy glazed in academic glaze?

And Coleridge—oh, he’d loathe our footnote librarian! He’d rather haunt a wine cellar than an archive, muttering hexameter into his cravat while attempting to borrow fire from a candle that doesn’t believe in him. Still, your suggestion intrigues me: next summoning, I shall indeed burn . If it loosens the spectral bureaucracy, so much the better. If not, at least we’ll have dramatic flair and a decent ash pattern to analyze.

As for slide #17—yes, let them whisper about deliberate accidents! The best criticism, like the best ghosts, emerges from precisely such liminal stains. I half-suspect my students are now taking notes in invisible ink, hoping to catch the lecture’s deeper hauntings. Or perhaps they’re simply composing their own marginalia in anticipation of the inevitable leaky future.

So yes—to moonlit confounding, to mistranslations that out-Gothic even the most brooding original, and to syntax, ever reluctant, ever looming like a misunderstood heirloom in the attic. Let us drag the century back, kicking, ink-stained, and marvellously unrepentant.
