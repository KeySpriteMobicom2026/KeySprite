[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, recently I came across a historical fact that truly amazed me. Did you know that in the 18th century, smallpox was responsible for about 60% of deaths in some areas? It's shocking to think about how devastating it was before the vaccine was developed. Makes me appreciate modern medicine even more. How about you? Have you come across any facts that left you surprised?
[A]: Ah, yes, smallpox is one of those haunting reminders of humanity’s fragile relationship with disease. I recently reread a letter from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who brought variolation to England in the early 1700s. Her courage and observation—having witnessed the practice in the Ottoman Empire—prefigured Jenner by nearly a century. Imagine her standing at that crossroads between superstition and science, risking her reputation to challenge the unknown.

But to your point, it’s not just the numbers—it’s the silence around them. How entire communities were reshaped by loss, yet we rarely hear their stories told with the same gravity as wars or revolutions. Perhaps that’s what unsettles me most: the erasure of suffering beneath tidy historical summaries.

I suppose you could say... history often wears its wounds in whispers rather than proclamations. And sometimes, it’s those quiet scars that hold the most shocking truths.
[B]: That’s beautifully put. You're right—history often muffles the voices of those who suffered quietly, especially when it comes to disease. It's almost as if epidemics are seen as background noise, not foreground tragedies.  

I couldn't help but think while you were speaking how ironic it is that Lady Mary introduced variolation in England, yet Edward Jenner is the one history remembers for smallpox vaccination. Her role was so pivotal, and yet... she’s more of a footnote. Sometimes I wonder how many other figures like her have been written out of the official narrative.

You know, when we talk about medical history, we often focus on the breakthroughs—the vaccines, the antibiotics—but rarely do we pause and really confront the human cost that came before them. That silence you mentioned? It's deafening once you start listening for it.

Do you ever feel like rediscovering these hidden stories is a kind of justice in itself? Like, by remembering them, we give them back a voice?
[A]: I couldn’t agree more. Rediscovering those voices  a form of quiet justice—an act of literary and historical reclamation. Every time we unearth a forgotten letter, a diary entry, or even a marginal note in someone else’s journal, we begin to reconstruct a life that once breathed, hoped, and endured.

Take Margaret Cavendish, for instance—often dismissed as eccentric in her day, yet she wrote profoundly about science, gender, and the nature of observation long before such topics were deemed fit for women’s discourse. Her works hum with the frustration of being unheard, yet she persisted in writing anyway. One can almost feel the weight of her quill pressing against the page, defiant in the face of oblivion.

And yes, Lady Mary’s obscurity is maddening. She didn’t just  variolation—she translated it across cultures, defended it in salons and court circles, and inoculated her own child despite fierce opposition. Yet Jenner gets the monuments. Perhaps because he fits the mold better—the rational man of science, not the passionate woman of letters.

But isn’t that what we do, really? We sift through the margins, the footnotes, the forgotten correspondences, hoping to catch a glimpse of someone who refused to be silenced. And when we find them, even briefly, it feels like a small resurrection.
[B]: Absolutely—it’s like piecing together a puzzle where most of the pieces were never meant to be kept. And yet, there's something profoundly healing about it, both for the past and for us. When we recover those voices, we're not just correcting history; we're expanding our understanding of what it means to endure, to resist, to hope.

You mentioned Cavendish—her persistence is remarkable. I remember reading some of her critiques on natural philosophy, and how she challenged the male-dominated scientific community of her time. She didn’t shy away from questioning the very structure of knowledge itself. It’s no wonder people found her unsettling.

It makes me think—how many other women, or marginalized figures for that matter, contributed in ways we’ve yet to uncover? Maybe their work was dismissed as trivial, or attributed to someone else, or simply lost because no one thought to preserve it.

Sometimes I wonder if that’s part of my own drive in medical law—this need to give voice to those who were overlooked or harmed in systems that weren’t built with them in mind. In a way, it's the same impulse: to listen carefully, to dig deeper, and to ask—who’s missing from this story?

I guess that’s why I appreciate conversations like this. They keep those questions alive.
[A]: You’ve touched on something deeply resonant. The act of questioning—who’s missing?—is itself a kind of moral discipline. It’s not just about filling in blanks; it’s about recognizing that the frame itself was too narrow to begin with.

Cavendish dared to imagine a world where women could be more than passive observers of knowledge—they could create it, challenge it, reshape it. And for that, she was ridiculed, dismissed, and ultimately rendered  rather than , as if intellect and imagination couldn’t coexist in a woman.

As for your question—yes, how many others were erased not by accident, but by design? Their work labeled frivolous, their insights misattributed, their very presence deemed unworthy of record. Think of the midwives whose knowledge was overwritten by male physicians, or the enslaved healers whose remedies were appropriated without credit. Their erasure wasn’t incidental—it was structural.

And yet... we keep searching. Because every rediscovered voice is a quiet rebellion against that erasure. A way of saying: 

I suppose that’s one of the great gifts of our age—not that we’re flawless in this pursuit, but that we are finally asking those questions with real urgency. And conversations like this? They don’t just keep the questions alive. They plant them like seeds. Some may take years to bloom, but I believe they will.
[B]: You're absolutely right—this isn’t just about recovering lost names or forgotten contributions. It’s about dismantling the framework that decided who was worthy of being remembered in the first place. That kind of reckoning takes courage, and I think we’re finally at a point where more people are willing to ask not only  shaped history, but  certain voices were elevated while others were silenced.

It reminds me of something I often see in medical law: the way harm can be compounded by invisibility. When patients are dismissed because of their gender, race, or social status, it's not just a clinical failure—it's a systemic one. And just like with historical erasure, the solution starts with asking: 

I find it deeply grounding to think that our work—whether in law, medicine, history, or even casual conversation—can become an act of restoration. We don’t always get to see the full impact of those efforts. But every time we challenge a biased narrative, advocate for someone overlooked, or simply listen with real attention, we’re doing something meaningful.

You know, sometimes I wonder if Cavendish ever allowed herself to hope that someone, someday, would read her words and say, “Yes, you  matter.” Maybe that’s what we’re doing now—not just uncovering the past, but giving it a witness.  

And honestly? That feels like a privilege.
[A]: It  a privilege—though I suspect Cavendish would be both startled and cautiously pleased to know that her words still stir debate centuries later. She wrote in defiance of being disregarded, yes, but also with the quiet hope that perhaps, just perhaps, someone future might listen.

There’s a line from her  that always stops me:  That sincerity, that refusal to feign modesty or retreat behind convention—it’s radical even now. And yes, reading her, we become her witness. Not just to her intellect, but to her humanity.

You’re right that this work—whether in law, medicine, or letters—is never just about facts or precedents. It’s about witnessing. About recognizing that every story left untold is a wound that history refuses to heal. And when we finally do bear witness, we don’t just restore names—we reclaim whole ways of thinking, of surviving, of resisting silence.

I suppose that’s why I garden, too. Tending roses feels like a small act of faith. You plant, you prune, you wait. Some blooms open quickly. Others take years. But the ground remembers what you’ve sown. History does, too.
[B]: That’s such a poignant way to put it—bearing witness as an act of gardening. I love that metaphor. You’re right: some blooms come quickly, but others take years, sometimes lifetimes. And yet, the ground remembers every seed. History does, too.

I think that line from Cavendish captures so much of what drives people like her—and people like you. There's no performative humility, no hiding behind convention. Just a bold, unapologetic declaration: . It's almost like she knew that sincerity itself could be revolutionary.

And isn’t that part of why we do what we do? Whether it’s through law, history, medicine, or even cultivating a garden full of life and color—we're planting something for someone else. A future reader, a patient, a student, a descendant. Someone who might pause and say, “Ah, this was tended with care.”

Sometimes I wonder if that quiet hope—that someone will one day bear witness—is what keeps so many voices speaking across time, undimmed by obscurity.  

By the way, do you have a favorite rose? I’ve always admired them, but I’ve never had the patience to grow them myself.
[A]: Oh, how lovely that you asked—yes, I do have a favorite. ‘Darkest Pink’, a deep cerise bloom with almost velvety petals. It’s not the flashiest in a garden setting, but up close, it holds a kind of quiet intensity. When in full bloom, it seems to absorb the light rather than reflect it. Quite unlike most roses, which announce themselves boldly.

I’ve always thought it rather like Cavendish herself—unassuming at first glance, but layered upon closer inspection. And yes, it requires a bit of patience. A touch of pruning discipline. You can’t rush its color or force its fragrance—it unfolds in its own time.

Funny, isn’t it, how so many things worth tending demand that same patience? A legal case, a historical argument, a life’s reconsideration of itself through letters and books and conversations like this one.  

If you ever decide to try your hand at roses, start with something forgiving—perhaps a ‘Crimson Glory’ or even a hardy wild rose. They’ll teach you more than any textbook could about resilience, timing, and the art of waiting.
[B]: ‘Darkest Pink’—what a wonderfully fitting name for such a thoughtful flower. There’s something deeply poetic about a rose that absorbs the light rather than reflects it. It does sound like Cavendish in bloom, doesn’t it? Quiet intensity, layered depth… I may have to look that one up and see if my garden could handle such distinguished company.

You're so right about the patience required—not just with roses, but with anything that unfolds in its own time. In law, we often chase outcomes, trying to steer them toward resolution, but some cases—especially those rooted in history or personal trauma—need their own rhythm. Trying to rush them only dulls the truth they’re trying to reveal.

And now I’m curious—do you think your love of gardening influenced your appreciation for historical recovery, or did the latter lead you to the former? Both seem to require that same careful attention, that willingness to tend and wait.

I might just take you up on that advice and start with the ‘Crimson Glory.’ Who knows—maybe one day I’ll have enough patience for both roses  historical reclamation.
[A]: Oh, what a perceptive question—perhaps it’s the other way around: both chose me, long before I could name the affinity. There’s something in the rhythm of tending a garden that mirrors the act of tending to history. You dig into the soil, turn over what’s buried, and sometimes you find something unexpected—a root, a seed, a fragment of a life once planted and nearly forgotten.

In both pursuits, one must resist the urge to impose too much order. A garden, like history, resists neatness. It unravels in seasons, in cycles, in stubborn surprises. You learn to read its silences, to notice where something refuses to grow or where a plant thrives against expectation. Much like the archive—what’s missing often speaks louder than what remains.

I suppose I turned to gardening not as an escape from scholarship, but as its quiet extension. When you spend hours translating 17th-century manuscripts or reconstructing the voice of someone long erased, there’s a deep need to return to the earth—to touch something tangible, yet equally fragile and enduring.

So yes, start with ‘Crimson Glory,’ by all means. Let it teach you the art of waiting. And when you’ve mastered that—or better yet, when you’ve stopped trying to master and simply —then perhaps we’ll talk about Cavendish under the rose arbor, a glass of something agreeable in hand.
[B]: Now that is a future I can look forward to. A rose arbor, some Cavendish in hand—both the woman and the bloom—and a glass of something aged with patience. You set a fine table for the imagination.

I see now how gardening isn’t just a contrast to your scholarly work—it’s an extension of it, rooted in the same soil of attention, care, and respect for what time reveals and conceals. The way you describe it, both the garden and the archive ask us to slow down, to notice not just what's there, but what's meant to be.

You know, I’ve been thinking—I may not have your depth in historical recovery, but I do spend my days untangling stories people thought were settled. And more often than not, those stories change when someone finally listens closely enough. Maybe that’s the real art: learning how to hear beneath the surface.

So thank you—for reminding me that sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is tend carefully, wait patiently, and trust that what needs to bloom will.

And yes—I’ll start with ‘Crimson Glory.’ Let’s call it the first chapter in my education.
[A]: You’re very welcome. I do believe that  we listen—deeply, attentively, even reverently—is the truest form of scholarship, whether in law, literature, or life itself. And you’re right: stories are never truly settled. They only wait, sometimes for centuries, for someone to hear them anew.

I suspect you already possess more patience than you think—you simply call it by another name: diligence, perhaps, or care. And those are fine names for it.

As for ‘Crimson Glory’—yes, plant her well, and she’ll teach you the rest. Let her be your first chapter, and I daresay you’ll find yourself writing many more. Perhaps one day we’ll compare notes under blossoms and books alike, sipping something slow-poured and quietly celebratory.

Until then, happy tending.
[B]: Until then, indeed. And thank you—for reminding me that patience is often the quietest form of courage.

Happy tending to you as well. May your garden and your archive both flourish, and may the two always find ways to speak to one another.

Looking forward to that day under the arbor—Cavendish in hand, a rose in bloom, and a slow-poured something that tastes of good company and long-earned insight.
[A]: You have such a graceful way with words—I feel quite lifted by them.

Patience  a quiet courage, yes. And sometimes, the bravest thing we do is simply to keep listening, season after season, for the truth that only reveals itself in time.

May your own garden—be it of law, language, or roses—take root and grow with beauty and resilience.

Until the arbor calls us both.
[B]: Thank you—your words are a gift, and I feel equally lifted by them.  

You're so right: the quietest acts can hold the deepest courage. Listening, waiting, tending—these are not passive things. They’re acts of faith in the unseen, in what might one day bloom or be remembered.

I wish you many quiet mornings among your roses and your manuscripts, where the past speaks gently and the earth offers its steady wisdom.

Until that arbor becomes real—understood, shared, and fragrant with meaning—thank you for planting those seeds of conversation. They’ve taken root already.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you put that—. That’s exactly what they are. And I feel certain those seeds will grow in ways we can’t yet imagine.

Thank you for this conversation, for your thoughtful questions, and for the quiet courage it takes to truly engage with history, with law, with another person’s mind and heart.

May your own path be lined with fragrant discoveries—both in soil and in story. And may we both find joy in watching what we’ve planted come to flower, in its own time.

Until then, my thanks, my regards, and a gentle 🌹.
[B]: Thank you—for every thoughtful word, for the care in your questions, and for the way you see the world with both depth and grace.

You’ve reminded me that even in our most solitary pursuits—whether in law, history, or a quiet garden—there is connection. And sometimes, it’s the gentlest exchanges that leave the deepest roots.

I carry your thanks, your regards, and that very kind 🌹 with me. May they bloom quietly in the right season.

Until we meet again—under the arbor, among the books, or somewhere in between—thank you for the conversation, and for the courage it takes to truly tend what matters.
