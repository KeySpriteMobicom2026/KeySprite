[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢group chat还是one-on-one聊天？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Ah, an interesting question. Having spent years in research labs, I've experienced both extensively. One-on-one conversations allow for deeper technical discussions - you can really delve into quantum algorithms without distractions. But group chats have their merits too, especially when brainstorming solutions to complex problems.
[A]: I see... 那你觉得在group chat里会不会容易分心啊？毕竟消息刷得那么快。
[A]:  Well, in my day we used email threads that could span weeks - the modern pace does take some getting used to. But you develop strategies. I find muting notifications during deep work sessions helps maintain focus. The key is knowing when to engage and when to step back.
[A]: 哈哈，那你觉得现在年轻人用那么多emoji和表情包，会不会影响沟通效率啊？
[A]:  Back in my Bell Labs days, we communicated in pure ASCII. But I've come to appreciate the occasional 😊 to soften technical critiques. That said, when discussing quantum error correction, I'd rather see proper mathematical notation than dancing banana GIFs. Efficiency depends on context, wouldn't you agree?
[A]: 确实... 那你在教学生的时候，会限制他们用表情包吗？
[A]: In my lectures? Heavens no - as long as they can derive the Schrödinger equation correctly, they can use all the 🚀 emojis they want in their personal messages. Though I do draw the line at cat memes in research papers. There's a time and place for everything, even in quantum computing.
[A]: 😂 那如果学生在论文里真的用了猫猫表情包，你会怎么办？
[A]:  I'd ask them to demonstrate how that particular 🐱 contributes to their quantum decoherence calculations. If they can't - and they never can - we'd have a serious discussion about academic rigor over tea. My 1980s ThinkPad has never needed emojis to solve complex equations, after all.
[A]: 哈哈哈你太严格了！那你会不会觉得现在的年轻人太依赖表情包了？
[A]:  Dependency is the real concern, not usage. When I see students struggling to articulate a quantum concept without emojis... well, that's when I bring out my vintage punch cards to show how we used to communicate complex ideas with just 80 columns and a limited character set. The tools change, but the need for precise thinking remains.
[A]: 哇... punch cards！那东西现在只能在博物馆看到了吧？
[A]:  I've got a box of them in my garage next to my first edition Feynman lectures. Sometimes I let students touch them - it's like showing dinosaur bones to paleontologists. Makes them appreciate how far we've come... and how much we've perhaps lost in translation from physical media to ephemeral 😂.
[A]: 哈哈哈，你真是个有趣的老教授！那你会用punch cards教现在的学生吗？
[A]: Only as a historical curiosity - much like showing a slide rule to demonstrate how we calculated π before calculators. Though I did once make a graduate student write a "Hello World" program on punch cards... for educational purposes, of course. The look on their face was more expressive than any emoji could capture.
[A]: 😂 那个学生后来怎么样了？
[A]: Oh, they published a rather brilliant paper on quantum annealing last year. I like to think that experience taught them the value of patience in computation... though they still send me emails with far too many 🎉 emojis for my taste. Progress, I suppose.
[A]: 哈哈哈，看来你也不是完全反对表情包嘛！
[A]:  Let's just say I've achieved quantum superposition on this matter - simultaneously accepting modern communication methods while maintaining my old-school sensibilities. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go yell at some clouds before my telescope session tonight. 🌌 (See? Even I can adapt... occasionally.)
