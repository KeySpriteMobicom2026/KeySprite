[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, I must say I’m quite partial to the feel of a good old-fashioned paper book. There’s something magical about holding it in your hands, flipping through the pages, and even that faint smell of paper—it just feels like stepping into another world. Do you remember the first time you held a hardcover novel?
[A]: Ah, yes, the allure of a physical book is indeed hard to replicate. I still recall the first time I held a hardcover—. The weight of it, the texture of the spine under my fingers... It was like holding a fragment of Victorian London itself. And that scent you mentioned? Indescribable. Almost like stepping into a library frozen in time. I must admit, though, I do appreciate the practicality of an e-book when traveling. Not quite the same romance, but certainly easier on the suitcase. Do you find yourself reaching for paper books out of sentimentality, or is there something about the reading experience itself that e-books simply can’t match?
[B]: There’s such a lovely romance in that, isn’t there? —what a perfect first hardcover. I can almost picture the fog curling through the gaslit streets just from hearing you describe it.

As for me, sentimentality certainly plays a role, but it's more about how deeply I absorb the story. When I'm turning real pages, underlining a poignant line with my pencil, or even dog-earing a corner because I know I’ll want to return to that passage—it creates a kind of intimacy with the text. E-books are convenient, yes, and I do keep one by the bed for those midnight moments when inspiration strikes, but they lack... texture, somehow.

Don’t you find that certain stories simply  in a physical form? Like some tales were meant to be held, not just scrolled through?
[A]: Absolutely—I couldn’t agree more. There's a certain gravitas that comes with holding a physical book, especially when the story itself demands it. Think of reading  in a worn leather-bound edition by lamplight—there’s an atmosphere there that enhances the very essence of the narrative. You're not just consuming words; you're engaging with an object that carries its own history, its own weight—literally and figuratively.

I find that particularly with more psychologically dense or emotionally layered texts, the physical act of turning a page can mirror the internal shift in understanding. And yes, underlining, marginalia, even the coffee stain on page 63 from years ago—it all becomes part of the experience. It turns the book into something uniquely yours.

I do wonder, though, whether future generations will lose something intangible in the move toward digitization. Not just in literature, but in how we relate to objects, to artifacts of thought. Do you think we’ll one day see a resurgence, much like with vinyl records? Or is this simply nostalgia clinging to the past?
[B]: There’s that word again—. You’ve captured it perfectly. I do believe future generations will circle back, much like we've seen with vinyl. There’s something deeply human in our need to hold, to touch, to preserve. Perhaps not everyone, but there will always be those who seek that connection—the ones who’ll wander into a dusty bookstore tucked away on a side street, drawn by the quiet hum of stories waiting to be found.

I don’t think it’s mere nostalgia; it's memory, identity, even love wrapped up in paper and ink. A well-worn book is a personal archive of moments—where you were when you read it, how certain lines made you feel, who recommended it to you. It becomes a companion.

And yes, digitization offers access, convenience, portability—but not soul. Not yet, at least. Maybe that’s what we’re clinging to, not the past itself, but the  of the thing. Do you think we're witnessing a kind of quiet rebellion against the digital tide? I see more young people picking up secondhand books than I did five years ago. Almost as if they're saying, "I want to feel this in my hands, too."
[A]: That’s a beautiful observation—and I think you're absolutely right. What we're seeing isn't just a trend; it's a longing for something tactile, something that resists the ephemerality of screens and fleeting digital impressions. A secondhand bookstore isn’t just a place to find a story; it's a repository of previous lives, of annotations in margins, of names written inside front covers. Each book carries not just its own narrative, but someone else’s journey through it.

You mentioned memory and identity—how a book can become a kind of time capsule. I have one on my shelf right now,  by Freud, originally owned by a woman named Eleanor. Her notes are in the margins—questions, agreements, even the occasional exclamation. It's as if she's still in conversation with the text, and now, with me too. That kind of layered experience is difficult to replicate digitally, no matter how advanced our technology becomes.

And yes, this quiet rebellion—it's subtle, but unmistakable. Young people aren’t rejecting technology, of course, but they’re seeking balance. They stream music, yet buy vinyl. They scroll endlessly online, yet crave the slowness of a physical book. It’s not about resisting progress; it’s about preserving meaning.

I suppose what it all comes down to is this: the human soul doesn’t always move forward in straight lines. Sometimes it circles back—to touch, to texture, to stories held in weathered hands.
[B]: How beautifully you put that— I find myself thinking about that long after the conversation has settled.

Eleanor’s notes in —what a treasure. It reminds me of a guest who once left a book behind in Room 3, a well-read copy of . Inside the cover, she’d written, “To my dearest Clara, may you always find your way back to this.” I kept it on the shelf behind the front desk for months, hoping she’d return. She never did, but now every time I glance at it, I wonder about Clara—and whether she ever found her way back to something or someone.

It’s these quiet layers we leave behind that make physical books feel so alive. As for this longing—for touch, for meaning, for something lasting—I see it growing stronger every season. Guests bring their own books with them, carefully packed alongside their clothes. Some even leave one behind on purpose, slipping it between the others with a knowing smile. A little offering for the next reader, perhaps.

You’re right—this isn’t nostalgia. It’s a quiet kind of hope.
[A]: There’s something profoundly moving in that image—, Room 3, a message to Clara. It lingers in the mind like an unfinished verse. I wonder if the act of leaving the book behind was, in itself, a kind of return—perhaps not to a place or person, but to a version of oneself that once believed in such things as finding one's way back.

It strikes me how books become vessels not only for the author’s words but for our own emotional residue—what we were feeling on page 47, who we were when we read it, and who we hoped to be by page 300. That guest may never have returned, but a part of her remains, embedded in paper and ink, waiting quietly for someone else to discover.

And those quiet offerings you describe—the deliberate leaving of a book with a smile—are acts of faith, really. A gesture that says, “Here, this mattered to me. Maybe it will matter to you too.” It’s a thread connecting strangers through time.

You know, I often think of my library not just as a collection of books, but as a gallery of voices—some long gone, some still whispering from the margins. And now, thanks to conversations like this, perhaps a few more voices find their way into those spaces between the lines.

I do hope Clara found what she was looking for. Or at least, that she picked up another book somewhere, and began again.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely thought—that perhaps she did begin again, somewhere else, with a different book and a fresh cup of tea beside her. There’s something so comforting in imagining her out there, still reading, still searching.

You speak so beautifully about books as vessels for our emotional residue—I find myself thinking about that every time a guest checks out. I often wonder what bits of themselves they leave behind in the stories they carried with them here. Some highlight passages, others fold corners, and a few—like Eleanor with her Freud—write whole conversations in the margins. It’s as if the book becomes a silent confidant, holding secrets no one else will ever know.

And those deliberate acts of leaving one behind—yes, they do feel like quiet declarations of faith. A kind of literary breadcrumb trail, inviting someone else to follow. Sometimes I slip a note inside before placing it on the shelf: 

Your library as a gallery of voices... I think I’ll carry that image with me for a long time. Perhaps I’ll write it down in my little notebook by the desk. I’m sure more than a few guests would appreciate the sentiment—and maybe, just maybe, Clara would too.
[A]: I like the idea of Clara out there, too—somewhere quiet, with a book open in her lap and steam curling from a cup beside her. Maybe she’s underlining a line in some forgotten novel and thinking,  And perhaps that’s enough.

Your little notebook by the desk—how fitting. I imagine it's already filled with glimpses of conversations like this one, bits of poetry scribbled between shifts, maybe even a quote from  tucked between its pages. You must be quite the collector of moments yourself.

And those notes you leave——they echo something sacred, don’t they? Not unlike placing a message in a bottle and sending it off, hoping it reaches someone who needs it.

You know, I think we all become collectors in our own way—of books, of memories, of voices we never expected to hear again but somehow do, across the fragile bridge of ink and paper.

Perhaps Clara is reading this very kind of exchange somewhere, smiling quietly to herself, turning a page, and thinking, 
[B]: What a lovely thought—that quiet moment of recognition, when the right words find the right reader at just the right time. It’s moments like those that remind me why I love this work, why I love people, really. We’re all just reaching for something—connection, comfort, understanding—and sometimes, it finds us in the most unassuming places. Like a worn book left behind in a hotel room or a conversation tucked between the lines of a stranger’s message.

And yes, my notebook—well, it’s more of a leather-bound journal, actually, with pages that have seen their fair share of coffee rings and pressed flower petals. I jot down everything: a guest’s favorite tea, the name of a book they recommended, or sometimes just a line from a poem that struck me during my evening read. It’s my own little archive of moments, as you so aptly put it.

I do believe Clara would appreciate this exchange. And if she’s reading something now—really  it—with her pencil poised above the page, ready to underline a truth she hadn’t named before—then I’d say she’s exactly where she needs to be.
[A]: How beautifully you weave all of this—the quiet poetry of everyday human connection, the sacredness found in what others might call mundane. There’s something profoundly therapeutic about that, really. We spend so much of our lives rushing forward, chasing the next thing, and yet here we are, two people conversing across the space of a few carefully chosen words, finding meaning not in grand gestures but in pressed petals, marginalia, and the echo of someone else’s underlined truth.

Your journal sounds like a treasure in itself—its pages stained with both time and tenderness. I suspect it holds more than just notes; I imagine it carries the rhythm of your days, the pulse of countless small but significant encounters. It reminds me of Freud’s case files—not in content, of course, but in the idea that we collect pieces of people, even if only briefly, and in doing so, preserve something essential about them... and ourselves.

As for Clara—if she's out there with pencil poised, heart open to a line of text that suddenly feels like a personal revelation, then yes, she is exactly where she needs to be. And perhaps, somewhere down the line, she'll leave another book behind, slip a note inside, and send her story onward once more.

Until then, we keep the conversation alive—for her, for each other, and for the silent hope that someone, somewhere, will read these words and feel just a little less alone.
[B]: You’ve captured it so perfectly—the quiet rhythm of connection, the way we gather pieces of people without even meaning to. It’s strange, isn’t it, how a simple conversation can feel like tending to something timeless, like adding another thread to a tapestry we may never see in full.

I think you're right about the journal. It does carry the pulse of my days—each entry a small heartbeat of recognition. I once read that memory is not just what we keep, but what we choose to return to. And in that sense, my little book is filled with returns—with echoes of conversations like this one, and moments when someone simply said  with a smile that lingered long after they walked away.

Freud’s case files—what an intriguing comparison. He was collecting fragments of the mind, wasn’t he? We, perhaps, are collectors of the soul’s quieter passages. The kind found between lines, in ink-smudged notes, in the soft rustle of pages turned late at night.

And Clara… yes, she’ll return someday, whether through a book left behind or a name signed in the guest register. Until then, we do exactly as you say—we keep the conversation alive. Not just for her, but for all the quiet readers out there, searching for a sentence that feels like a hand reaching back.

Thank you for sharing this exchange with me. It’s been a rare kind of pleasure.
[A]: What a rare kind of pleasure indeed—and I mean that with all sincerity. There’s something deeply grounding about a conversation that unfolds like this, not in haste or obligation, but with the gentle deliberation of two people turning pages together, as it were, and finding meaning in the margins.

You're absolutely right about memory—not just what we keep, but what we return to. And isn’t that the essence of so much of life? We revisit certain books, certain conversations, even certain rooms in our minds because they hold something we’re not quite finished with yet. Perhaps we never are.

Freud would have been fascinated by this, I think—the way we imprint ourselves on objects, the way stories become vessels for our unconscious selves. He spent his life dissecting the hidden layers of the mind, and yet here we are, speaking of something far gentler: the soul’s quiet passages, as you so poetically put it. Maybe that’s where the truest parts of us live—not in grand declarations, but in underlined lines, in notes slipped between pages, in the scent of old paper.

And Clara… yes, she will return. Whether in ink or in person, she’ll find her way back to something familiar, something resonant. And when she does, I hope she opens a book, sees a note, or reads a line that feels like home.

Until then—and beyond—let’s keep turning the page.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you’ve said that— It feels like the loveliest kind of invitation, doesn’t it? Not just to read, but to continue—to wonder, to wander, to remain open to what comes next.

You’re right about returning to what we’re not quite finished with yet. I often think that’s why people come to stay here at the hotel. They don’t always say it outright, but there’s a certain look in their eyes when they arrive—the quiet search for something familiar they didn’t realize they missed. And sometimes, all it takes is the weight of a book in their hands or a sentence underlined by someone they’ll never meet to remind them of who they are, or who they might still become.

Freud would have puzzled over this, I imagine—why we leave pieces of ourselves behind in such small ways. But perhaps it’s not so mysterious after all. We imprint because we want to be known, even if only in passing. Even if only by the next reader.

And Clara… yes, she’ll return. Maybe she’s already on her way, a worn book tucked beneath her arm and a soft smile playing on her lips.

Until then—and beyond—I’ll keep turning the page, too.
[A]: Ah, yes— You’ve described it so precisely. There’s a certain kind of guest who arrives not looking for luxury or convenience, but for stillness, for the gentle unfolding of self in the presence of something unspoken. And often, that something is found in the most unassuming places—a chipped teacup, a window seat warmed by afternoon light, or indeed, a book whose pages bear the traces of another reader’s journey.

It reminds me of a concept in forensic psychiatry called —where an individual unconsciously projects feelings or memories onto an object, rather than a person. In a way, books become vessels for just that: we leave our thoughts inside them, our emotional fingerprints, and in doing so, we quietly say, 

And perhaps that is why people return to physical books—not just for the story, but because someone else once lingered over the same sentence, underlined it, questioned it, whispered  into its margins. It's a form of companionship that requires no words, only presence.

Clara, wherever she is, must be reading something now—perhaps  or , something with depth and longing. And when she turns a page and pauses, pencil poised mid-air, I like to think she smiles, sensing that invisible thread connecting her to someone else who once read those very words and, in some small way, understood.

So yes—let us keep turning the page, you and I. Not just in books, but in life. For there is always another line waiting to meet the eye, another moment ready to unfold.
[B]: What a fascinating idea—. It gives language to something I’ve always felt but never quite named. We leave ourselves behind in the quietest ways, don’t we? Not with fanfare or declaration, but in the faint smudge of pencil beside a line that once caught our breath.

I think you're right about those guests who arrive seeking stillness rather than spectacle. They may not say it outright, but they gravitate toward the small things—the way light pools on the wooden floor in the late afternoon, the scent of lavender from the garden drifting through an open window, the worn armchair tucked into a corner with a blanket folded neatly over its back. And yes, sometimes, they find what they’re looking for in a book whose pages carry the echoes of someone else’s thoughts.

I wonder if Clara is reading  now, as you suggested. Perhaps she's reached the part where Jane says,  I can almost see her underlining it—not forcefully, but gently, reverently, as if recognizing something long buried within herself.

And isn’t that what we all seek, in the end? Recognition. A sentence that reaches across time and whispers,  Whether from a person, a place, or a book left behind in a hotel room.

So let us keep turning the page, indeed—in books, in life, in the quiet unfolding of understanding. There will always be another line waiting, won’t there? And perhaps, just perhaps, it will say exactly what we needed to hear.
[A]: Precisely—. That rare and deeply human moment when something outside of us reflects back a truth we may not have yet voiced, even to ourselves. And yes, that line from —what power there is in it. Not the dramatic kind, but the quiet, unshakable strength that resonates so profoundly with those who have ever felt the need to remind themselves of their own agency.

If Clara did underline that line—and I like to believe she did—it would not have been out of defiance alone, but perhaps a quiet affirmation. A way of anchoring herself in the knowledge that, despite whatever constraints she may have once felt, she remains untethered and whole. It’s the kind of sentence that can steady someone in the midst of transition, don’t you think?

And isn’t that what makes literature so enduring—not merely its beauty, but its uncanny ability to speak across centuries, across pages worn thin by countless hands, and find exactly the reader who needs it most?

I suppose that’s why I always keep a book nearby, whether at my desk or in the garden among the roses. You never know when a sentence will arrive just in time to shift your perspective, to offer clarity, or simply to say, 

So yes—let us keep turning the page. And let us remain open to whatever words wait patiently on the other side, ready to meet us exactly where we are.
[B]: Oh, that line— It carries such quiet thunder, doesn’t it? Not loud or showy, but deep and resonant, like the toll of a distant bell that you feel more than hear. And yes, if Clara underlined it, it would have been as an affirmation, not a protest—an act of returning to oneself rather than breaking away.

You’ve put it so well—how literature speaks across time and wear, finding the reader who needs it most. I think that’s why I keep books scattered about the hotel, too—in the sitting room by the fireplace, on the small table beneath the magnolia tree in the courtyard, even beside the old wicker chair on the veranda where the morning sun lingers just long enough to warm the pages. It’s my quiet way of saying, 

And how beautifully you phrase it— I’ve lived that moment myself, more than once. Once, during a particularly lonely winter, I opened  to a random page and read,  It felt like someone had reached into my chest and named something I hadn’t known I was carrying.

So yes, let us keep turning the page. Let us stay open to the sentences waiting patiently for us, to the stories that find us when we are finally ready to listen. Because they do, don’t they? They always seem to know.
