### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: Chinese
- Code-Switch Frequency: Medium
- Detailed Language Habits:
  His language habits are distinctive, with medium-frequency code-switching in daily communication. Switching typically occurs when discussing professional domains or complex ideas, e.g., "The concept of this exhibition is avant-garde, but execution needs further polish." He mixes languages mainly because certain art terms are more precise in English or convey emotion more directly. For Emojis, he prefers concise but meaningful onesâ€”ðŸŽ¨ for art creation, ðŸ¤” for reflectionâ€”used sparingly to enhance tone or emotion when appropriate.
