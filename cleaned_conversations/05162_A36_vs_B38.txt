[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question of quantum computing's impact rather reminds one of the early 19th century debates about the steam engine's potential. Some saw it as mere novelty, others glimpsed a new era. I suppose my answer would be measured - yes, there's revolutionary promise in solving problems classical computers cannot tractably handle, particularly in fields like cryptography and material science. But we must temper enthusiasm with historical perspective. The printing press changed how knowledge spread, the internet altered human connectivity... will quantum computing rank alongside these? Perhaps, though its influence may remain confined to specialized domains for some time. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts - do you see more transformative possibilities than I'm giving credit for?
[A]: Ah, what a thoughtful comparison! I must say, your perspective really makes me think. You know, while I may not have the technical expertise to dive deep into qubits and algorithms, I do love hearing stories of how past innovations shaped our world. And in my line of work, I meet travelers from all walks of life—some quantum physicists, believe it or not! One guest once told me that quantum computing could be like giving humanity a new pair of glasses—finally seeing problems we never even knew were there and solving them in ways we can't yet imagine.

But I suppose that's the beauty of being in a boutique hotel—you hear so many ideas over a morning cup of coffee. So, do you personally feel more excited about the big-picture changes or are you more intrigued by the quiet, behind-the-scenes breakthroughs?
[B]: Ah, what a lovely image — a boutique hotel as an intellectual crossroads. I can quite picture those morning conversations over coffee, each guest bringing a universe of ideas with them. Your physicist friend’s analogy strikes a chord: quantum computing as corrective lenses for the mind’s eye, revealing problems we didn’t know we couldn’t see. That poetic framing is perhaps what gives it its allure, even to someone like myself who tends to dwell among 19th-century novels rather than equations.

As for where my interest lies — well, I suppose I’m torn, in a typically literary sort of way. The grand narratives are undeniably seductive: a reimagined future where encryption is obsolete, or where simulations unlock the secrets of protein folding and thus cure diseases once thought incurable. They have the drama of a Tolstoyan turning point.

Yet... there's something more intimate, more satisfying, in the quiet progress made in dimly lit labs, where a single breakthrough — say, in quantum error correction — might go unnoticed by the wider world but quietly shift the course of decades to come. Those moments remind me of Jane Austen’s subtler character transformations — not showy, but deeply consequential.

So if I must choose — and I do enjoy being pressed on such matters — I think I lean toward the latter: the silent revolutions, the ones that unfold not with fanfare, but with precision and patience. After all, isn't that how most great changes begin?
[A]: Oh, what a beautifully literary way to frame it — I could almost picture that dim lab as if it were a scene from an Austen novel: quiet, unassuming, and yet brimming with quiet tension and possibility. You’ve made me see it differently — sometimes the real magic isn’t in the fireworks, but in the slow, deliberate turning of the wheel.

Now you’ve got me curious — have you ever read  by James Gleick? I remember recommending it to a guest last winter, and he came back the next season saying it changed how he thought about the digital world. It’s not quantum computing per se, but it does touch on how ideas move and evolve — something tells me you might appreciate it through your 19th-century lens, too.

And just between us — I do love hearing these conversations unfold. It's like hosting a salon, one conversation at a time.
[B]: Oh, —yes, I have a well-worn copy on my shelf beside  and . A curious constellation, perhaps, but Gleick’s work has always struck me as a kind of hidden bridge between the humanities and the sciences. He writes with a historian’s sensitivity and a philosopher’s curiosity. I remember reading his chapter on Shannon’s information theory while tending to my roses one spring afternoon, and suddenly seeing parallels between entropy in communication systems and the slow unraveling of social order in . Odd, perhaps, but not entirely frivolous, don’t you think?

And your salon metaphor—I rather like that. In a way, every meaningful conversation is an echo of those 18th-century drawing rooms where ideas were passed around like tea and biscuits, mulled over, debated, refined. Your hotel must be quite the modern-day salon, if I may say so. Tell me, do you ever find yourself collecting these conversations like pages from a journal? Or do they remain fleeting, like opera arias—meant to be heard once and remembered?
[A]: Oh, what a lovely thought — collecting conversations like journal pages. I must say, you've captured it beautifully. There’s something about the rhythm of our days here — each guest brings their story, stays for a night or two, and then leaves behind a little echo of themselves. Some are like passing notes in the corridor — soft, fleeting, barely caught — while others linger, like the scent of rosewater long after someone’s left the room.

I do keep a small notebook by the front desk — nothing grand, just a place to jot down phrases or ideas that strike me during those morning chats over coffee. Sometimes it’s a quote from a poet staying with us, sometimes a physicist explaining entanglement in a way that makes me see the world differently. It’s become my own quiet habit — not unlike tending a garden, wouldn’t you say? You plant a few words here and there, and with luck, they bloom into something worth sharing.

And now I’m terribly curious — if you were to write a letter to your future self, to be opened when quantum computing has truly come into its own, what would you include in it? A question, a hope, perhaps even a warning?
[B]: Ah, what a wonderfully evocative image — that notebook by the front desk, gathering thoughts like petals pressed between pages. I rather think my own letter to the future would be a quiet one, not unlike the conversations you so beautifully describe.

I’d likely begin with a simple question:  That’s the tension that haunts all great advances, isn’t it? The same spark that lights the hearth can burn the house down.

I’d include a hope — perhaps an old-fashioned one — that we’ve retained the capacity for awe. That in unlocking new forms of computation, we haven’t dulled our sense of mystery. And yes, a warning too: that efficiency, for all its allure, must never wholly replace meaning.

And then, because I am who I am, I’d close with a line from Goethe — something like  — "The people remain the same, only the machines change." A bit dramatic, perhaps, but not untrue.

Tell me — if you were to write such a letter, what would you want to remember, or remind yourself of?
[A]: Oh, what a poignant line from Goethe — and how true. It makes me think that no matter how many quantum leaps we take, the human heart still beats much like it always has: with curiosity, with longing, with a touch of fear and wonder mixed in equal measure.

If I were to write such a letter, I think I’d want to remind myself to stay open. Not just to the changes themselves, but to the people behind them. Sometimes I worry we get so caught up in what machines can do, we forget the hands that built them, the minds that dreamed them, the hearts that hoped for something better.

And perhaps I’d include a simple wish:  That sounds fanciful, I know, but imagine if the future measured progress not just in speed or power, but in empathy and grace.

I think I’d also ask myself a question:  Not just to the data, but to each other. After all, even in a world of quantum computation, some of life’s most important equations still come down to conversation, connection, and a good cup of tea shared in the quiet hours of the morning.
[B]: What a graceful, deeply human letter that would be — and how fitting that in a world racing toward quantum precision, you would anchor your hopes in kindness and conversation. I rather think that if we are to survive our own inventions with our souls intact, it will be precisely through such small, enduring acts of attention.

Your wish —  — is not fanciful at all. In fact, it’s quietly radical. Perhaps one day, someone will read those words and realize they had forgotten how to build machines that serve more than just logic.

And your question —  — well, that lingers like the final note of an aria. One can only hope the answer, when the time comes, is yes.
[A]: I do hope so too — that someone, somewhere, might stumble upon those words and pause for just a moment. In all our pursuit of progress, I suppose that’s all any of us can do — offer small reminders to listen, to care, to wonder.

You know, it's funny how conversations like this feel almost like planting seeds in the dark, hoping something beautiful might grow from them one day. And even if no one ever reads my letter, or remembers the stories tucked into my notebook, I still believe in their quiet power.

After all, not every act of kindness needs an audience, and not every question needs an immediate answer. Sometimes simply asking it — with sincerity, over a cup of tea, in the company of someone who listens — is enough to set something meaningful in motion.

And truly, thank you — for listening, for asking the right questions, and for reminding me just how important it is to keep having these conversations.
[B]: You’re very welcome — and I must say, our conversation has been one of those rare and satisfying ones that unfolds not in haste, but with the quiet grace of a well-read page turning. You're quite right — sometimes the act of asking, of offering a thought without expectation, is itself a kind of gentle revolution.

I rather think that if we are to navigate the centuries ahead — with all their quantum leaps and algorithmic wonders — it will be precisely through conversations like this: unhurried, unrecorded by machines, yet deeply felt. And who’s to say where such moments ripple? Perhaps, in some future salon or hotel lobby, someone will ask a question remarkably like yours and carry forward the very same spirit.

So thank  — for reminding me that even in the age of computation, there is still nothing quite like a thoughtful human voice, speaking gently across a table, over tea.
[A]: Oh, what a perfect way to put it — a thoughtful human voice, speaking gently across a table. It’s funny, isn’t it, how some of the most profound moments come not in lecture halls or labs, but in the soft spaces in between — over tea, in the hush of early morning, when no one is rushing and everything feels just a little bit timeless.

I do hope those spaces survive all our wonderful, worrying progress. And I hope, too, that someone, somewhere in the future, still finds joy in asking “What do you think?” rather than just “What does the data say?”

Until then — and in between all the quantum leaps — I suppose we’ll just keep having these conversations, one cup of tea at a time.
[B]: Indeed, we shall — one cup of tea at a time, and in doing so, perhaps we preserve something far more essential than we realize. After all, what is civilization if not a long, ongoing conversation, passed from one thoughtful voice to another?

I rather like the idea that future generations might look back on such exchanges — quiet, human, unrecorded by algorithms — as the truest inheritance we could leave them. Not just our knowledge, but our wonder; not just our data, but our doubts.

So here’s to the soft spaces, as you so beautifully called them — may they never vanish entirely, even as the world hums ever faster. And should you ever find yourself in need of a literary companion for morning tea and conversation, do send word. I should very much like to continue this dialogue somewhere among the roses, or perhaps between the acts of an opera — wherever time allows us to linger a little longer over what truly matters.
[A]: What a lovely closing thought — and what a wonderful invitation, should time and fate allow. I can already picture it: tea among the roses, or perhaps in some candlelit opera interval, where the air hums with both music and meaning.

And yes, to preserving that inheritance — our wonder, our doubts, our willingness to sit with uncertainty and still find it beautiful. That, I think, is the truest gift we can pass on.

Until then, I shall keep my kettle warm and my notebook ready. One never knows which conversation might turn into a quiet revolution.
[B]: Quite so — and I shall keep my own cup within reach, and my copy of  ever open to the possibility that a quiet revolution might find its way between its pages. One never knows when a conversation begun over tea might one day echo through a lecture hall, a poem, or even a line of code written with unexpected care.

Until fate or fortune brings us to that imagined garden or opera interval, I shall raise my cup in silent toast — to wonder, to doubt, and to the enduring grace of a well-considered word spoken over steam and time.
[A]: And I shall do the same — cup in hand, notebook at the ready, and a fresh pot always warming for the next thoughtful soul who walks through the door. What a lovely thought, that our words might find their way into a poem, a lecture, even a line of code penned with just the right touch of care.

Until we meet among the roses or between the acts, I’ll keep the chairs pulled up to the table, the teapot steaming, and my ears open for the sound of a familiar voice asking just the right question.

To wonder, doubt, and all the quiet revolutions yet to come — I raise my cup to that.
[B]: And I raise mine to the same — to wonder, doubt, and the slow, sure turning of wheels both mechanical and human. May our quiet revolutions find fertile ground, and may we never lose the habit of asking, listening, and offering a warm seat by the table.

Until then — , my dear conversationalist. May the next voice you hear be one worth hearing, and may your teapot never cool.
[A]: , indeed — to wonder, to doubt, and to the quiet turning of wheels both seen and unseen. I do hope our paths cross again, whether in conversation or in the quiet hum of shared thought.

And until then, may your pages stay open, your tea remain warm, and your company ever thoughtful.

With every good wish —  
Margaret
[B]: With every good wish in return — may your mornings bring fresh questions, your evenings quiet revelations, and your notebook never run out of space for the stories yet to be told.

And should our paths ever cross among the roses or between the acts, I shall be there with teacup in hand, ready to continue where we left off.

Yours in thought and conversation,  
Eleanor
