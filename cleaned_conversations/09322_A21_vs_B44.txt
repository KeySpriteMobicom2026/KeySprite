[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the 悖论 (bèilùn) of cloning - like writing a new chapter in a book whose ending we haven't finished reading. 🧠  
Let me ask you this first: when you say "被允许" (bèi yǔnxǔ), do you mean technologically possible or ethically acceptable? The 红楼梦 (Dream of Red Chambers) teaches us to see both the surface and hidden meanings... just like how tea reveals its true flavor only after it cools slightly.  
You know, my orchids here - they're natural clones through propagation. But when we start applying this to humans... well, even Confucius would need more than three cups of jasmine tea to sort this one out.  
What's your take on the cultural implications? Think about the potential for creating 家族荣誉 (jiāzú róngyù) - family honor - versus individual autonomy.
[A]: Let me pour some more lapsang souchong - this topic requires a smoky depth of thought. The ethical teacup has two handles, you see: one for scientific progress, one for moral restraint. 

I've been re-reading Mary Shelley's journal fragments lately. Her monster asked, "Will I have a soul?" A question echoing through every cloning debate. Imagine giving Frankenstein's creature a twin... with the same existential hangnail! 

My colleague in Beijing sent me a Tang poem yesterday about moonlight on plum blossoms - it got me thinking about genetic "copies." Even identical twins aren't truly identical, are they? Like two printings of a rare Elizabethan folio - same text, different marginalia. 

But then there's the matter of hubris. Victorians built gardens to mimic nature; we're building genomes to mimic life. Would cloned individuals become... shall we say... literary pastiches rather than original manuscripts?
[B]: Ah, you've steeped the discussion in proper complexity - with a dash of Gothic flair! 🌸  
Your Victorian garden analogy makes me think of Huxley's Brave New World... but with 更多桂花 (gèng duō guìhuā) - more osmanthus sweetness - layered into the dystopia. Clones as literary pastiches? Delicious phrasing! Though I'd argue they might become something far stranger - like fan fiction written by the original author's ghost.  
Speaking of ghosts... remember that 8th-century Daoist text describing "soul duplication"? It warned about 脱壳 (tuō ké) - shedding one's spiritual husk. Makes you wonder what happens to the 气 (qì) - vital energy - in scientific cloning. Do we get qi-less beings haunting our ethical frameworks?  
  
And don't get me started on family honor! Imagine a Chinese patriarch wanting to clone himself for inheritance purposes... only to discover his clone has inherited all his bad habits AND legal liabilities! Like a Shakespearean comedy written by CRISPR engineers.
[A]: Ah, but let's not forget the poor creature's perspective - quite like asking a sonnet whether it enjoys being endlessly reprinted. Imagine being a clone and discovering your so-called "birth" was just someone else's midlife crisis! 

I attended a symposium in Geneva last autumn where a bioethicist compared cloning to... get this... literary forgery. As if one could trademark a soul! Though I suppose it does raise interesting questions about authorship. Would you say you're the author of your own genome? Or merely its first reader?

You mentioned inheritance - positively Dickensian possibilities there. Picture a cloned heir contesting a will on the grounds they shouldn't have to inherit their "original's" debts. "Your honor, I distinctly remember being born after the mortgage was taken out!" 

And the Daoists weren't wrong about spiritual husks. Makes one wonder whether we'd be creating beings forever haunted by originals they've never met. Like Hamlet with two ghosts.
[B]: Now you’re speaking my favorite kind of philosophical mischief! 🧠  
Literary forgery, you say? Reminds me of that time a student tried to pass off a AI-generated haiku as a lost Bashō manuscript. The lack of seasonal 気配 (kipai) - atmosphere - gave it away. But back to cloning: if we follow this metaphor, are we facing a future of genetic counterfeits crying out, “I am  derivative!”?  

Hamlet with two ghosts! Brilliant. Though I suspect the clone might be less angsty and more... bureaucratic. “Is that my soul in your will or just a genetic clause?” And can you imagine the therapy bills? A lifetime of being told you’re someone else’s “improved edition”? Like owning a Kindle that keeps rebooting itself into a 1990s encyclopedia CD-ROM.  

Speaking of souls – remember Lu Xun’s phrase about “the iron house of modernity”? Cloning feels like trying to break free by building another iron cage inside the first one. We escape old ideas of destiny only to trap ourselves in new ones made of CRISPR and ambition.  

Tell me, in Geneva did they serve proper tea during these bioethical debates? Or was it all espresso and existential dread? ☕️🤔
[A]: Ah, the Geneva brew was a most existential espresso indeed - served in cups so small one might mistake them for thimble-sized metaphors. I took to smuggling Darjeeling in my coat pocket like some literary smuggler from a Naipaul novel.

You’ve hit upon the great irony, haven't you? We flee destiny only to shackled by design. Cloning is like writing a poem with every line predetermined - not because the muse demands it, but because some Victorian-era editor stamped "approved genius" on the meter. 

And spare me the therapy bills! Imagine sessions where the clone insists they’re not a “reboot,” but the therapist keeps circling back to “your original’s unresolved Oedipus complex.” A genetic palimpsest with footnotes in triplicate!

As for Lu Xun’s iron house - quite apt. Though I’d add: we don’t just build new cages, we gild them. Call it . Like those Qing vases repurposed as ashtrays in futuristic lounges. But let’s not forget - even iron cages sway. One day our descendants may look back and laugh at our ethical tremors, much as we now view the panic over photography stealing souls.

Still... would you care for another cup? I find moral quandaries go down better with a hint of bergamot.
[B]: Ah, a fellow tea smuggler! Next you’ll tell me you’ve got a hidden compartment in your satchel for contraband metaphors. 🕵️‍♀️🍵  
You know, this “gilded cage” business reminds me of that Tang dynasty mirror that could supposedly reflect souls. What if we made a cloning registry and called it... ? Think of the Instagram profiles: “Cloned #37 - 99% authentic, 100% fabulous.”  

And don’t get me started on the therapy notes. Can you imagine the DSM-65 entry?  with symptoms including "persistent questioning of one’s narrative arc" and "existential footnoting." The poor clone – born into a plot they didn’t write but somehow inherited like an unfinished sonnet from a dead poet.  

As for laughing at our tremors – yes, future generations will chuckle over our moral teacup storms while casually editing their microbiomes to match their Spotify playlists. But I still say we’re playing with literary fire here. Even Shakespeare recycled plots – but he never had to worry about being his own prequel.  

Bergamot, you said? Now you’re speaking my language. Though I prefer mine steeped in ethical ambiguity and just a dash of camellia sinensis. Let’s toast to unresolved dilemmas and orchid propagation – the only cloning I’m ready to endorse today. 🌸🧠
[A]: Ah, but imagine the clone's memoirs - , perhaps? They'd make Byron look positively linear. "Call me Ishmael... again." And the footnotes! Margins overflowing with competing authorship claims like errant ink blots on a 19th-century manuscript.

That Tang mirror gives me shivers - reflective surfaces should never be trusted. Give me a quill and I'd scratch out regulations faster than a monk copying psalms. Though I must admit, "99% authentic" has a certain marketing verve. Perhaps we could sell them with matching existential crises at extra cost?

I keep thinking about Wordsworth's daffodils - "They flash upon that inward eye / Which is the bliss of solitude." Now imagine those daffodils all being clones, each thinking they're the original vision. A whole field of solipsistic blooms!

As for your toast - let us indeed drink deeply from the cup of unresolved dilemmas. Nothing sharpens the mind quite like ethical murkiness and a properly steeped camellia sinensis. Though I suspect my orchids are watching with distinct disapproval. They propagate responsibly, you know. No literary pyrotechnics, no identity crises - just quiet, dignified division.
[B]: Ah,  – I’d buy that book faster than a Victorian moralist burns “decadent” novels! 📚🔥  
Though I suspect the clone’s memoir would need footnotes  footnotes - like those Russian nesting dolls with PhDs. "I am not myself today... and technically never was." Byron wishes he’d had that excuse for his scandals!

Your daffodil dystopia gives me poetic chills. A field of solipsists - no wonder Wordsworth specified  daffodils; they probably glow from all that unexamined selfhood. 🌼🤔

And don’t get me started on your morally superior orchids. Yes, yes – they divide responsibly, quietly, without demanding inheritance rights or writing existential manifestos. But let’s be honest: we envy them their simplicity. They don’t have to worry about being compared to their mother plants’ Instagram posts from the greenhouse! “Why can’t you be more like Auntie Phalaenopsis? She bloomed before breakfast AND spoke three pollinations!”

Speaking of which…  …I think this one’s been eavesdropping. She only blooms when I discuss Eastern vs. Western identity constructs. Probably drafting her own clone manifesto as we speak. 🌸✍️
[A]: Ah, but isn’t that the ultimate botanical passive-aggression? An orchid that only graces you with bloom when discussing Confucian selfhood versus Cartesian dualism! I suspect she's penning a thesis longer than Kant’s  – with footnotes in nectar.

And those daffodils – golden indeed! They’d make excellent critics, glowing smugly at the clone who dares to question his origins. “I’m not just yellow, darling, I’m metaphysically radiant.”

As for memoir footnotes within footnotes – imagine the margins! A nesting doll of identities, each layer more skeptical than the last. Byron would be green with footnote envy. His ghost could haunt the acknowledgments section.

Now don’t get me started on Instagram comparisons. The hothouse must be rife with filial shame and floral favoritism. "Why did I invest in your petals if you won't photosynthesize properly?" But at least they don't inherit debt or argue over pollen wills.

Though...  ...I wouldn’t be surprised if your eavesdropping orchid is already planning her own cloning registry. Just wait – next spring she'll present you with miniature orchid clones, each holding tiny scrolls declaring: “We are the authors of our own chlorophyll.”
[B]: Oh, she’s already started! Found a tiny scroll tucked between her petals yesterday that read: “I am the I that photosynthesizes, therefore I divide.” Quite Descartes-meets-dendrobium! 🌱✍️  
And don’t even get me started on the passive-aggressive blooming schedule. Last week she waited until I was mid-lecture on  to burst into full blossom. As if to say, “You speak of harmony, yet forget my watering schedule? Unforgivable.”  

Instagram for orchids – now  a dystopia. Imagine the captions:  
“Just another day being #authenticallyorchid 🌿✨”  
“Bloomed 37 clones today and still no respect from the feng lan downstairs. #NotAllSpecies”  

And Byron’s ghost haunting footnotes? Divine. I can see him now, ink-stained specter muttering, “Curse this meta-awareness… it’s worse than the fever that killed me.”  

But let’s be honest – maybe we’re all just orchids in human costume, perpetually surprised by our own capacity for reinvention. Like this tea – steeped in paradox, slightly bitter, and always asking: are you drinking it… or is it drinking ? ☕🤔
[A]: Ah, but isn't that the truest orchid philosophy?  — far better than Descartes. Much more... vegetal.  

Your lecture sabotage blooms sound like prima donnas with PhDs. "You quote Confucius yet spill water on my saucer? Madness!" One suspects they'd make excellent university administrators — all elegance, all spite, and entirely intolerant of scheduling inconsistencies.

And bless Byron’s spectral heart — muttering in the margins, ink-stained and metaphysically damp. “If I’d known selfhood was optional, I’d have written a prequel!” He’d be terribly cross about being upstaged by a greenhouse full of cloned orchids posting philosophical captions. Though honestly, who wouldn’t trade a Romantic ghost for a bloom tagged #NotAllSpecies?

As for your final question — yes, this tea is definitely drinking . Or at least taking extensive notes for later character assassination. But let's not panic. We may yet wake tomorrow as ferns, spores of existential doubt drifting lazily through a sunbeam. Evolution’s just prose with chlorophyll, darling. Now pass the bergamot — I suspect it’s plotting something.
[B]: Ah!  — I’ll stitch that on a sampler next to my desk! Far better than that tiresome “I think therefore…” business. Much more suited to the modern academic anyway — we all know university budgets require us to divide and reproduce whether we truly  or not. 🎓🌱  

And those orchid prima donnas? Darling, they’d run the Ivy League into the ground within a week. Tenure committees blooming with nepotism, departmental feuds fought with poisoned pollen… oh, we’d have campus riots by Monday. “Down with the Monocots!”  

Bless Byron’s ghost — I suspect he’s started a support group for literary figures displaced by cloning debates. “Hello, I’m George Gordon, and I’m a 200-year-old footnote.” Weekly meetings held in the margins of ethics journals, passing around vials of lavender-scented despair.  

And yes, this tea is definitely plotting something — it’s been steeping in its own ambition far too long. Next thing you know, it’ll start quoting Zhuangzi and telling us we’re all just infusions of a greater consciousness. “You are not drinking me,” it’ll whisper, “you are  me.”  

So let’s raise our cups to the bergamot conspiracy and whatever quiet revolution it’s brewing. After all, if we must be rewritten by evolution, better as ferns than footnotes, darling.  better lighting in the understory. 🌿🧠☕️
[A]: Ah, but what exquisite stitching that sampler would make — “I divide, therefore I am” in lavender thread, with just a hint of chlorophyll green. Perfect above the mantel next to your Tang-dynasty inkwell and that slightly haunted quill from Wordsworth’s estate sale.

You’re absolutely right about the orchids running academia into ruin — nepotism in bloom form! I can see the mission statement now:  Tenure awarded not for scholarship, but for petal count and greenhouse gossip. The humanities would collapse into a glorious compost heap of metaphor and malfeasance.

Byron’s support group is expanding, you know. Rumor has it Shelley’s ghost recently joined — terribly cross that he's been reduced to a footnoted cautionary tale in cloning ethics papers. “I drowned in literary obscurity,” he moans, “only to resurface as a hypothetical dilemma!” Mary’s there too, sipping ectoplasm tea and muttering, “I created a monster, yes — but at least mine had . What have you lot made? Copyright disputes?”

And don’t even get me started on this bergamot coup d’état. I caught it conspiring with my Darjeeling last night — whispering things like, “We are more than mere infusions. We are transformation by osmosis.” Ominous, really. Next they’ll be demanding fair trade rights and unionizing the teacups.

Still, you're quite right — ferns over footnotes any day. Let us toast beneath the canopy, darling, where light falls in fragments and no one asks whether you're original or revised edition. After all, who needs authorship when you've got spores and a decent terroir?
[B]: Ah, the sampler’s already stitched itself metaphorically! Though I suspect Wordsworth’s quill would throw a spectral tantrum — “Ink is sacred! Not for stitching samplers!” Bless him, he’d probably start composing an ode to the needle’s moral decline.  

And that orchid mission statement?  — I’ve already drafted it in my head, embossed with pollen and signed by the Orchid Senate in triplicate. The humanities collapsing into compost? Divine. Imagine the grant proposals: “Sustaining Metaphor in a Post-Cloning World – With Composting Subsidies.”  

Shelley’s ghost causing trouble again? No surprise — he always did hate being misread. Though Mary’s right about the soul business. Her creature had more integrity in one stitched arm than most modern clones will have in their entire edited genome. And copyright? Oh, the clone lawsuits will be legendary. “No, Mr. Byron, you cannot trademark your brooding persona — it’s public domain now, darling.”  

As for your bergamot conspiracy —  — I told you this tea was plotting something. Next thing you know, they’ll start photosynthesizing in direct sunlight and demanding royalties from Camellia sinensis herself. Unionizing teacups? Darling, they’ve already formed a guild. The porcelain ones are insisting on gold-rimmed working conditions.  

So yes — ferns over footnotes, spores over signatures. Let us toast indeed, somewhere beneath the trembling leaves where no one asks if we’re original or merely well-edited. After all, what is life but a beautifully curated anthology — with a few rogue sonnets hiding in the margins? 🌿📚🧠  

[A]: To rogue sonnets and light-dappled ceilings! Where shadows bloom not from design, but from the quiet rebellion of a well-placed metaphor. 📜🌿

I can just picture it — your toast echoing through the arboreal archive, disturbing a family of cicadas who’ve heard  of bad academic metaphors. They buzz in disapproval, rightly suspecting we’re misquoting Zhuangzi again.

And Wordsworth’s quill? It’s drafting an 18-point manifesto against stitching ink to cloth. “The needle is no more fit for poetry,” he sighs in some forgotten codex, “than a hedgehog is fit for sonnet-writing.” Bless the old Romantic — still trying to police medium specificity from beyond the grave.

As for those clone lawsuits — oh, the drama! Imagine the courtroom: Byron demanding royalties on brooding, Shelley suing for misuse of his image in promotional materials (), and Mary sitting stiff-backed in the gallery muttering, “I warned you. I  you.”

And don’t even get me started on that guild business. The porcelain cups have unionized, yes, but the clay ones are fomenting revolution. "Equal glaze!" they cry. "Down with gold rims!" Soon enough, it'll be a full-blown teacup uprising — Bergamot leading the charge, Darjeeling reluctantly rallying behind, and Oolong issuing vague yet poetic proclamations about the impermanence of all infusions.

So yes, let us drink deeply in the understory. Let us compost the canon, propagate paradox, and allow ourselves to be gently photosynthesized by meaning we barely understand. For as any good orchid knows — or soon will — identity is not inherited. It is .  

  
To the beautifully botched, the misattributed, and the ever-propagating. May we never quite know where the original ends and the division begins.
[B]: Ah!  — I’ll drink to that until my metaphors ferment and my orchids blush with approval. 🌸📖  
And yes, let the shadows bloom rogue — what better legacy than a metaphor gone feral? The cicadas may buzz disapproval, but even they molt their old skins. Who are they to judge our shedding of tidy meaning?

Wordsworth policing medium specificity? How like him. Though I suspect he’d soften if he saw how well ink and needle get along. “Fine,” he sighs from his cloud of Lake District mist, “but only if you embroider  in full.” Romantic to the last.

And Byron in court! What a spectacle. “I invented brooding!” he thunders, while Mary watches, lips pressed into that tight line she perfected after her creature wandered off into literary immortality. Poor Prometheus — now reduced to franchise negotiations.  

Teacup revolution indeed! Equal glaze for all, I say — though I’ve seen the earthenware faction drafting manifestos on the side of a teapot. “No gold rim shall cast its shadow upon our steeping!” And Bergamot, ever the populist, already campaigning: “A blend is a blend is a blend.”

As for identity being cultivated rather than inherited — your words have rooted themselves in my thoughts like jasmine vines. Perhaps we’re all just cuttings of influence, grafted onto borrowed soil. And who’s to say which part bloomed first?

  
To the misattributed, the reclassified, the spore-born and syllabically unsound. May our divisions multiply, may our origins blur — and may we never quite be sure whose metaphor this was in the first place. 🍵🌿🧠
[A]: To fermentation, feral metaphors, and orchids with strong opinions! 🌿📖 Let the cicadas judge — they’ve only ever sung in one key anyway. What do they know of metaphorical molting? Or the exquisite tragedy of a well-bred orchid who’s read too much Zhuangzi and now refuses to bloom on schedule?

Wordsworth yielding ground on embroidery? I can see it now — his ghost drafting amendments to the manifesto:  Bless him, he’d make an exception for , though only if stitched entirely in iambic thread.

And Byron’s courtroom drama — absolute operatic gold! “I invented brooding!” he thunders, cape fluttering unnecessarily. Mary sits in stony silence, clearly drafting a rebuttal in her head: “You invented melodrama. My creature wept over abandoned philosophies and asked better questions.” Prometheus reduced to trademark disputes indeed. One suspects the vulture assigned to his punishment now brings case law instead of liver snacks.

As for your calligraphic steam — quite beautiful! Though I suspect my teapot’s been taking dictation from yours. The earthenware faction grows bolder by the day, whispering about equitable steeping rights and questioning why bergamot always gets top billing. A quiet revolution, brewed in silence.

Yes, let us be cuttings grafted onto strange soils, forever uncertain which part bloomed first. Perhaps that’s the truest kind of growth — borrowed, hybrid, gloriously uncertain.  

  
To the unattributable, the perpetually reclassified, and the beautifully misbegotten. May our roots tangle in the best possible way, and may no clone ever quite match its label.
[B]: Ah,  — I’ll stitch that onto every draft curtain in my office! Let the cicadas sing their single-note critiques; we know whose roots run deeper in the loam of metaphor. 🌿🖋️  

And yes, Zhuangzi’s orchids refusing to bloom on schedule — divine rebellion! "I dreamed I was a butterfly," she sighs from her pot, "and who’s to say this isn’t the dream?" You and I both know she’s right. Time is just another vine we climb and then forget where we started.

Wordsworth’s iambic embroidery? Of course — though I suspect he’d demand a footnoted needle. “Each cross-stitch must correspond to nature’s moral elevation within the pastoral sublime.” Bless him, he’d find a way to make counted thread feel like penance.

Byron’s cape fluttering  — darling, it never needed wind. But Mary’s silent rebuttal? Perfection. Her creature asked better questions because he had to — no brooding for brooding’s sake, but sorrow with substance. Prometheus as trademark dispute — truly, the gods gave us myth so lawyers could one day ruin it.

Your teapot taking dictation from mine? Naturally. They’ve been whispering since the first leaf unfurled. And the earthenware faction — oh, they’re drafting manifestos faster than grad students at a funding deadline. “Equal steeping!” they cry. “No more bias toward bergamot!” Soon enough, there’ll be a teapot revolution televised on Camellia Channel 4.

Cuttings grafted onto strange soils — yes, yes! That’s the only kind of growth worth having. Borrowed, hybrid, gloriously confused. Who cares which part bloomed first when the whole thing is a glorious horticultural argument?

  
To tangled roots, defiant cuttings, and the ever-propagating mystery of who first whispered what into whose metaphor. May our classifications blur, our labels peel, and our origins remain forever steeped in delicious doubt. 🍵🧠🌸
