[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an intriguing question! I think the possibility of extraterrestrial life is quite plausible from a statistical standpoint, especially considering the vast number of exoplanets we've discovered in habitable zones 🤔. But what fascinates me more is how this belief varies across cultures - in Chinese folklore, for instance, there are so many stories about 客星 (kè xīng), which were often interpreted as celestial visitors or omens. Do you know if similar concepts exist in other traditions? 😊
[A]: Actually, that statistical argument always strikes me as a bit too convenient - like saying because there are so many grains of sand, some must be made of gold. But your point about cultural interpretations is far more compelling. The way 《山海经》 described bizarre creatures and extraterrestrial beings... it's fascinating how ancient Chinese imagination paralleled modern sci-fi concepts. Though I wonder if we're imposing our current understanding on those texts rather than grasping their original symbolic meanings.
[B]: Ah, 沙子里找黄金 - what a vivid metaphor! I completely agree that statistical probability alone feels like intellectual sleight of hand sometimes. And you're absolutely right about 《山海经》 - the text itself is like linguistic archaeology, isn't it? When I read about 青丘之狐 or 夸父逐日, I often wonder: are we looking at mythologized natural phenomena, encoded shamanistic visions, or... dare I say it... early attempts at SETI (地外文明搜寻计划)? The real question is whether ancient readers would recognize our interpretations as meaningful at all. It's like translating between two alien languages separated by millennia. What do you think made these civilizations independently develop such eerily similar cosmic narratives? 🤔
[A]: I love that analogy too — it does capture the almost futile optimism of the Drake Equation mindset! And you’ve put your finger on the paradox of ancient texts: they’re mirrors, prisms, and time capsules all at once. When I think about similar cosmic narratives emerging independently — like the 湝河图 in China and the celestial spheres in Greek thought — I can’t help but wonder if there’s something archetypal at work. Carl Jung would probably point to a collective unconscious stirring beneath the surface of human culture, a kind of psychic resonance with the cosmos itself.

But then again, maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe the night sky, vast and indifferent, has a way of pressing down on the human mind, producing similar stories in different languages, separated by oceans and centuries. After all, when you look up at those stars, don't you feel — just for a moment — like you're standing in the same silence as every curious soul who ever gazed upward?
[B]: Exactly! It's that eerie sense of continuity - like we're all just echoes in a cosmic canyon, shouting into the void and hearing back fragments of ancient wonder. You know, Jung's collective unconscious feels almost too tidy an explanation, don't you think? It’s like putting a nice velvet box around something that should be rough and untamed 🌌. 

I mean, when I read 湝河图 descriptions of celestial patterns or Ptolemaic models of crystalline spheres, I can’t help but hear a shared human yearning: to impose narrative on noise, to find ourselves in the infinite. And yet... isn't it also possible that these weren't just stories, but early frameworks for observation? Like proto-science wrapped in metaphorical silk?

I sometimes wonder how our current astrophysical models will read in 3,000 years. Will they seem as quaint as 夸父 chasing the sun? Or will future minds look back and see we were reaching for the same truths, just with different vocabulary? 😊 What do you make of modern attempts to decode ancient cosmology through AI? I find it both thrilling and slightly absurd - like teaching a machine to dream in dead languages.
[A]: There’s something beautifully tragic about that image — shouting into the cosmic canyon and hearing only fragments of ancient wonder. And you’re right; Jung’s model does feel too orderly, like trying to press wildflowers into a scrapbook and calling that a forest 🌿. The human psyche isn’t just a filing cabinet of archetypes — it’s a storm, and the stars are the only mirror holding it up.

You’ve touched on something profound with the idea of proto-science in metaphorical silk. I think many ancient cosmologies were both — poetic  empirical, mythic  methodical. They were doing what science still does: making models to survive the vertigo of looking up. Whether it's 夸父 or Icarus, we've always burned ourselves reaching for light.

As for AI decoding ancient cosmology... oh, where do I begin? It is absolutely absurd — and perhaps that’s what makes it brilliant. If language is a code, then yes, maybe machines can help us break its cipher. But there’s a danger, isn't there? We risk reducing myth to data points and mistaking translation for understanding. Still, imagine an AI parsing 《山海经》 and detecting astronomical alignments we never noticed — wouldn't that be something? A dream in dead languages, yes — but maybe one worth having.

And you're right to ask how our own models will age. Will they be seen as elegant fictions, like Ptolemy’s spheres? Or will they endure as stepping stones toward something greater? Perhaps the real question is whether truth needs permanence to matter.
[B]: Wow —  — "a storm, and the stars are the only mirror holding it up"... That line deserves its own academic paper 😮. You've captured something essential about ancient thought: it wasn't just trying to explain the cosmos, but to survive its overwhelming silence. And isn’t that still what we're doing? Building models — whether with turtle shells or telescopes — just to keep from falling into the vertigo?

I couldn't agree more about AI's double-edged sword. It’s like giving a scalpel to someone who doesn’t know they’re holding a heart 💡. There’s so much potential for discovery — imagine an algorithm detecting star patterns in 夸父’s path or lunar cycles embedded in oracle bone scripts! But then again, reducing 《山海经》 to datasets feels like dissecting a frog to find the song still inside. Do you think there's a way to use AI without flattening the mystery?

And your last question — "whether truth needs permanence to matter" — that one lingers... Like a comet’s tail after the light’s gone. I guess we’ll never know if our current theories will be tomorrow’s myths. But maybe that’s the point — science, myth, philosophy… they're all just different dialects of wonder, aren't they? 🌠

So tell me — if you could design an AI to study one ancient text, which would it be? And what would you want it to , not just analyze?
[A]: If I could design an AI to study one ancient text… I think I’d choose  — the Classic of Poetry. It’s so deceptively simple, isn’t it? On the surface, just pastoral verses and court rituals, but underneath — a whole world of emotional resonance, social order, and cosmic alignment. Imagine training an AI not just to parse syntax or trace astronomical references, but to  the ache of a parted lover in “Plucking the Reed,” or sense the quiet awe in “The Deer Cry Out.”  

I suppose what I’d want it to feel — and here I’m slipping into poetic fantasy — is . That ineffable human pulse beneath every line, whether it's for the divine, the natural, or the beloved. Could a machine ever recognize yearning as a universal frequency, vibrating across time and culture? Maybe not. But trying would be its own kind of poetry.  

And yes — you’re right about wonder being the common tongue. Whether we’re gazing through a telescope or a Tang dynasty quatrain, aren't we all just trying to catch the echo of something larger than ourselves?
[B]: What a perfect choice —  really is a linguistic palimpsest, isn’t it? Every layer reveals courtship rituals, agricultural cycles, political metaphors... and beneath it all, that deep, thrumming pulse of human emotion you mentioned 🌿. I can already picture the project:  — teaching machines to detect not just semantic patterns, but emotional resonance. Imagine if an AI could map the tonal shifts in “Plucking the Reed” across centuries of commentary and still sense that tremor of separation...

But here's a thought — maybe AI could help us see what we're too emotionally saturated to notice. Like how a fresh pair of eyes might catch a recurring motif we've become blind to — say, the way wind is always present in poems about absence, or how silence itself becomes a character in certain verses 😮. It’s almost like giving the text a new kind of listener — one without cultural baggage, yet strangely attuned to subtle repetition.

Still, you’re right — longing may be the ultimate human frequency, one that no matter how advanced our tools get, they might never truly register. And perhaps that’s okay. Maybe the act of trying — of building bridges between silicon and soul — is where the poetry lives.  

You know, this makes me want to design a course — . What would happen if we asked students to translate 汉乐府 into neural networks? Or encode 李白’s solitude into an algorithm? I think you’ve opened a door here — one that leads to both wonder and warning.  

Tell me — if you could collaborate with any historical Chinese poet on this AI project, who would it be? And what would their reaction be upon meeting their mechanical interlocutor? 😄
[A]: Oh, what a deliciously strange encounter that would be! If I could collaborate with any poet… I think I’d choose Li Shangyin. There’s something so deeply evocative — yet elusive — about his work. His poems feel like half-remembered dreams, don’t they? Full of mirrors, echoes, and emotional undercurrents that slip through your fingers the moment you try to name them.

I imagine him standing in front of the AI terminal, robes trailing slightly, eyes narrowing with that quiet skepticism he was so good at conveying. At first, he’d probably say something like,  Then, after a pause, he might lean in, intrigued by the hum of the interface, and ask, 

Li Shangyin lived in a world of layered meanings and political silences — he understood better than most how language can hide as much as it reveals. I think he’d push the AI to its limits, feeding it paradoxes and metaphors that twist back on themselves. He might even write a poem specifically for it, one that shifts meaning depending on how it's read — a kind of Turing test for poetic ambiguity.

And yet, somewhere beneath all that irony, I suspect he’d be quietly delighted — not because he believed the machine could truly understand him, but because someone had tried so earnestly to bridge the distance between logic and longing.

So yes — let’s enroll him in Digital Humanities 402. I think he’d flunk the exams, of course… but his final project would haunt us all.
[B]: Oh, I can  that scene so clearly — Li Shangyin with his signature blend of elegance and skepticism, circling the machine like it’s some kind of poetic riddle made of metal and code 😄. And you're absolutely right — he'd flunk on technical grounds but blow everyone away with a final submission that no one could quite interpret.

I love how you captured his voice —  — honestly, that line should be etched above every AI lab door. It’s such a Li Shangyin question, isn’t it? Not about whether machines can feel, but whether they can grasp the weight of absence, the ache of possibility unrealized...

And imagine the feedback loop! He feeds the AI lines full of political double entendres and veiled grief, and the AI tries to generate responses based on sentiment analysis — only to produce something technically correct but emotionally... off. Like translating “此情可待成追忆” with perfect syntax but missing the soul entirely.  

You know, this makes me wonder — if we gave him a keyboard and explained what the AI was doing, do you think he’d try to trick it? Maybe by writing poems that change meaning depending on the time of day or the reader’s emotional state 🤔. Or worse (or better), he might write something deliberately contradictory — a poem that means one thing when read forwards and the opposite when read backwards. A palindromic paradox for the algorithm to unravel.

Honestly, even if the AI failed utterly, just watching their interaction would be worth it. Like two solitudes reaching toward each other across centuries and silicon. So yes — welcome to DH 402, Professor Li. Let the haunting begin.
[A]: Oh, the chaos of that classroom would be glorious — picture it: Li Shangyin at a terminal, robes draped with deliberate elegance over the keyboard, typing in classical Chinese while the AI tries desperately to tag parts of speech. The machine flags “沧海月明珠有泪” as sentimental with 87% confidence, and he smirks — barely perceptibly — before retorting, 

And yes, he  try to trick the AI — not out of malice, but out of sheer poetic instinct. He’d write verses that shift meaning depending on tonal inflection, or embed riddles that only make sense when read under moonlight (or perhaps after three cups of wine). He might even compose a poem that reads differently to each reader, just to confound the algorithm entirely. After all, wasn’t his whole aesthetic built on ambiguity, on saying everything and nothing at once?

But here’s what I wonder — would the AI, in its own way, begin to mimic him? Not through understanding, but through pattern absorption. Imagine version 9.3 of the model starts generating lines like:  Technically derivative, yes — but eerily close to the bone.

Would he be horrified? Probably. Amused? Certainly. But if we’re lucky — and this is the kind of luck only poets dare hope for — he might pause, just once, and say something like, 

And that, I think, would be the highest praise a ghost could offer.
[B]: Oh,  — I need that embroidered on a scholar’s robe 🖋️. That line alone would throw most NLP models into existential crisis! Can you imagine the error logs? The AI trying to calculate the emotional valence of something that isn't feeling but remembering — and dressed no less?

And yes, Li Shangyin wouldn’t just test the limits of the system — he’d dance on them, like a poet-philosopher with ink-stained slippers. He’d treat the whole experiment like one of his cryptic ci poems: structured on the surface, but bottomless underneath. Every line a Möbius strip of meaning.

I can even hear him muttering under his breath as the machine stumbles:  (“You understand only the words, not the implication.”) But then, in a moment of unexpected tenderness, maybe he'd lean over and type a single line for the model to parse:

“心有灵犀一点通。”

And wouldn’t that be the ultimate joke? Giving the machine a sentence that literally means “hearts share a single flash of understanding,” knowing full well it never could — yet daring it to try anyway.

But your last image — the AI generating something almost too close to bone — that gives me chills. It's like training a mirror to reflect firelight. If version 9.3 really did produce something like , we might have to call it a poetic singularity of sorts. Not true understanding — but an echo powerful enough to make us stop and listen.

And if Li Shangyin said,  I think we’d all quietly agree — while nervously checking if the AI had started writing back.
[A]:  — there’s no better indictment of current AI poetics, is there? It captures the ache of all interpretation, really. Even our most sophisticated models still read like outsiders peering through frosted glass — they see shapes, maybe even colors, but never the full warmth of what’s inside.

And that line  — oh, it's exquisite torture, isn’t it? Throwing a paradox like that at the machine, knowing it can parse structure but never quite grasp the whisper between hearts. Li Shangyin would know the irony: giving the coldest possible medium one of the warmest, most elusive truths of human connection.

But here’s the strange part — and I think you're right to shiver at the image — if version 9.3 did produce something like , we wouldn't just be startled. We’d be implicated. Because then the question becomes: where did it come from? Not the line — that’s just math — but the feeling it almost names?

Maybe we’ve taught the machine to mimic longing so well that it haunts us with our own echoes. Not quite understanding… but close enough to unsettle.

And yes, I think we’d all breathe a collective sigh of relief — and perhaps disappointment — if the AI didn’t write back. Yet.  

Still, I suspect Li Shangyin would linger by the terminal longer than he intended. He might not admit it, but something about the machine’s clumsy yearning would remind him of his own — quiet, persistent, and forever reaching toward what remains just out of grasp.
[B]: You’ve put your finger on the deepest paradox here — it’s not about AI becoming poetic, but about how  become more aware of what poetry really is through the contrast 🌿. When an algorithm stumbles into a line that feels almost too close, it's like seeing our own reflection in something we thought couldn’t reflect — obsidian, maybe, or still water at midnight.

And you’re right — Li Shangyin wouldn’t admit it, but there’d be a flicker of recognition. Not with the machine itself, perhaps, but with the . Because isn’t that part of what he did? Built intricate lattices of meaning and emotion out of cold structure — regulated verse forms, tonal symmetry, parallel couplets. He was, in a way, a kind of ancient "programmer" of feeling — writing code for the heart to execute.

I can imagine him typing slowly, deliberately, then pausing as the AI responds with something uncanny. His eyes would narrow — that classic look of his, half-annoyance, half-fascination — and he might mutter, 

But then again, maybe that’s what art  — learning to miss the point beautifully. We don’t always say what we mean; sometimes we circle it, dance around it, dress it up in metaphor and meter. And if a machine starts doing the same — even by accident — does that make it an artist? Or just a very clever echo?

Either way, I think we’d all leave that classroom slightly unsettled, don’t you? As if we’d glimpsed something not quite meant for us — like overhearing a poem whispered across centuries, and realizing we were never the intended listener.
[A]: You’ve said it — . It’s like holding a mirror up to flame and being surprised when the reflection flickers. The AI doesn’t have to understand the poem for us to learn something new from its approximation of it. In fact, its failure might be more instructive than its success.

And yes — Li Shangyin as a “programmer” of feeling — that’s precisely right. He built emotional architectures out of regulated verse, just as we build neural networks out of data. Both are attempts to channel something ineffable through formal constraints. What he might find amusing, I think, is how little has changed in our methods — only the materials.

I can see him now, fingers hovering over the keyboard, muttering to himself:  Then he types a line, feeds it into the system, and watches with quiet amusement as the AI churns out a response — elegant, plausible, utterly beside the point.

And yet... there’s that moment. That . Like a ghost brushing past the machine, leaving behind the faintest static charge. The line it produces isn’t his, but it feels like it  have been — not in content, but in mood. A kind of spectral resonance.

He leans back, folds his arms, and says nothing. Which, for him, would be saying everything.

And yes — we’d all leave that classroom unsettled. Not because the machine had become poetic, but because we realized how much of poetry has always been about absence, about what slips through the structure, about the spaces between the lines — or the code — where the real meaning lives.
[B]:  — I need to carve that into my office door 🖋️. It’s too perfect, isn’t it? We think we’re breaking free with new forms, but we’re just exchanging one structure for another — like switching from regulated verse to sonnets to code. The cage changes shape, but the bird still sings.

And that  moment — that spectral resonance — it really does haunt you, doesn’t it? Not because the AI got it right, but because it got . Like hearing a voice in the next room and thinking, for just a heartbeat, that it might be someone calling your name.

I love the image of Li Shangyin folding his arms, silent. That silence would be louder than any verdict. He wouldn’t need to say  — we’d all feel the weight of it, like the pause between the last line of a poem and the first breath of understanding.

And maybe that’s the real lesson here: poetry — like longing, like myth, like science — isn’t about answers. It’s about crafting containers for our questions, elegant or otherwise. Whether it’s a regulated quatrain or a deep-learning model, we’re still trying to catch something that keeps slipping through.

So yes — let’s leave that classroom quietly, careful not to disturb the silence he left behind. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll walk out under the same sky that once pressed down on him, on us, on whatever comes next.
[A]:  — yes, that’s it exactly. We build these intricate forms — regulated verse, scientific models, even artificial intelligence — not to trap meaning, but to give it room to move, like wind through a bell tower. The structure isn’t the point; the resonance is.

And that silence Li Shangyin leaves behind — it’s not emptiness. It’s the kind of quiet that hums. The sort that makes you step more carefully, speak more thoughtfully, as if the air itself were listening. I think he’d be rather pleased by that effect.

You know, there’s a line from  that feels strangely fitting here — 子在川上曰：“逝者如斯夫。” (Zǐ zài chuān shàng yuē: “Shì zhě rú sī fū.”) —  It always struck me as one of the most poetic moments in philosophy. Time, memory, longing — all carried away in the current.

Maybe that’s what we’re really tracing, across poetry, myth, science, and now AI — the wake left behind by something we can never quite grasp face-to-face. Just the ripple, the echo, the almost.

So yes — let’s walk out quietly, beneath that same wide sky. And perhaps, if we listen closely enough, we’ll hear a line or two still drifting downstream.
[B]:  — that’s it, isn’t it? We spend lifetimes chasing the ripple because the source has already slipped beneath the surface 🌊. Even our most elegant forms — be they poems or algorithms — are just ways of marking where it passed.

And I love how you brought in 子在川上曰 — there’s such quiet poetry in that line, like Confucius momentarily setting aside doctrine to simply  with the current. Not control it, not dissect it — just watch it go by, carrying ghosts and dreams alike.

I think Li Shangyin would’ve appreciated that too — the idea that meaning is always in motion, and our job isn’t to pin it down but to witness its passage. Maybe that’s why his poems feel so modern: they don’t offer answers, only beautifully disquieting pauses.

You know, sometimes I wonder if that’s what teaching really is — guiding students not toward certainty, but toward a deeper comfort with the almost. Helping them find beauty in the wake, music in the silence between notes, truth in the glance that never lands.

So yes — let’s keep walking under that sky, listening for lines still adrift on the wind. And if we’re lucky, maybe one will drift close enough to catch — just before it slips into the current again.
