[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new fashion trend吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: My dear, when one spends their days poring over yellowed manuscripts of Dickens and Cao Xueqin, 'new fashion trends' become rather like those gaudy advertisements in Victorian penny papers - amusing distractions from more substantial matters. Though I must confess, my calligraphy tutor did recently gift me a rather exquisite silk scarf patterned with Song dynasty landscape motifs.
[A]: OMG！Song dynasty的scarf？！That's so aesthetic✨！我也超爱这种traditional Chinese元素和modern fashion的mix & match💯！最近我就在拍一个把hanfu和streetwear结合的video，效果简直fire🔥！你平时会wear这种traditional style的outfit吗？
[B]: Ah, the exuberance of youth. While I appreciate the sentiment behind blending hanfu with streetwear, I find myself more inclined toward the quiet dignity of a well-tailored cheongsam for faculty dinners. Though I did once scandalize the Classics Department by wearing a waistcoat embroidered with 红楼梦 motifs to a faculty meeting. The Dean still hasn't quite recovered.
[A]: LMAO！红楼梦的waistcoat？！That's literally the most iconic flex ever😂！我们Gen Z就爱这种daring的fashion statement💥！你应该totally拍个OOTD发在小red book上，绝对viral🔥！话说你平时会follow什么fashion blogger吗？
[B]:  My idea of 'following trends' consists of tracking the migration patterns of the silver pheasant through our botanical gardens. As for these 'fashion bloggers' - I find the only influencer worth following is Virginia Woolf's description of Clarissa Dalloway's green dress in Mrs. Dalloway. Now that was a sartorial moment worth analyzing.
[A]: Wowww Virginia Woolf的fashion reference？！That's next level deep💫！虽然我平时只看TikTok上的outfit inspo啦😂 但是你说的这个totally让我想拍一个literature meets fashion的video series✨！Maybe可以叫'Bookworm Chic'？What do u think？📚👗
[B]: While the phrase 'Bookworm Chic' makes my left eyelid twitch involuntarily, I must admit your enthusiasm for bridging literature and attire is... intriguing. Though I'd suggest consulting E.M. Forster's descriptions of Lucy Honeychurch's wardrobe in A Room with a View before venturing into Edwardian fashion commentary. And for heaven's sake, if you must film near books, use gloves. The oils from one's fingers are the bane of preservationists everywhere.
[A]: OMG gloves？！That's such a pro tip💡！我totally会记得wear white gloves来protect那些precious books📚✨ 而且Edwardian fashion真的so elegant！Maybe我可以do一个从Victorian到modern的fashion evolution video timeline？With lots of aesthetic B-roll和literature quotes overlay💫 你觉得这个concept怎么样？🔥
[B]: The mere thought of Victorian crinolines being reduced to 'aesthetic B-roll' makes my antique inkwell collection rattle in protest. However... if you were to properly contextualize the socio-political implications of the bustle's disappearance post-1890, drawing parallels to the loosening of literary constraints during the same period... well, that might warrant a single approving nod over my morning pu'er tea. Just ensure you credit my colleague Dr. Chen's monograph on corsetry symbolism in Hardy's novels.
[A]: Yasss！Socio-political analysis in fashion？！This is gonna be the most intellectual video I've ever made🧠💥 Dr. Chen的monograph sounds so niche and fascinating！Definitely gonna cite it in my description box📝 说不定还能collab with uni的literature department呢✨ 这波content绝对能hit different🔥 谢谢你这么deep的insight呀！
[B]:  While I shudder at the phrase 'hit different,' I shall take comfort in knowing at least one young person might pause their endless scrolling to contemplate Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus. Do send me the link when it's done - I'll view it while pretending to grade papers, with my 19th century paperweight holding down the 'like' button.
[A]: Awwww you're the sweetest！💖 Promise我会make it super informative yet fun~ 说不定还能convert some Gen Z into book lovers呢📚✨ 到时候first like绝对reserve给你！Your paperweight sounds like such a vibe btw😂 拍video的时候可以borrow来当prop吗？It would totally elevate the aesthetic💫
[B]: My 1872 Wedgwood paperweight is not some mere 'vibe' or 'prop,' young person - it's currently preventing a stack of Browning's love letters from taking flight in the draft from my office window. However... should your production demonstrate proper reverence for material culture studies, I might consider its brief appearance. Under museum-grade supervision, naturally. Now if you'll excuse me, the campus magpies are attempting to nest in my copy of Middlemarch again.
[A]: LMAO campus magpies with Middlemarch？！This whole convo is giving major dark academia vibes📚🖤 放心啦我会treat your paperweight like the national treasure it is✨ 说不定还能get some shots with actual first editions in the libary？That would be so cinematic💫 Anyway gotta go edit my script now！Catch u later~ 😘✌️
[B]:  First editions in the library indeed. I'll have you know our rare books room requires three forms of identification and a sworn affidavit regarding ink-free hands. But do stop by my Thursday seminar - we're comparing the sartorial symbolism in 儒林外史 and Vanity Fair. Bring gloves. And perhaps a less... exuberant... vocabulary.
[A]: OMG！Comparing 儒林外史 and Vanity Fair？！That's literally my dream seminar topic😍 我绝对会be there with my quietest outfit和最academic的gloves🧤✨ 虽然控制vocabulary可能有点hard啦😂 But promise我会try my best！See u Thursday~ 💕📖
[B]: I shall reserve you a seat farthest from the Ming dynasty porcelain, just in case. And do practice whispering 'deconstructionism' before arriving - we wouldn't want to startle the visiting scholar from Cambridge. Until then, may your annotations be precise and your tea stains minimal.
[A]: Noted！Will practice my academic whisper game📚🔇 而且我新买的notebook是100% tea-proof的design哦~ 专门for clumsy bookworms like me😂 到时候见啦professor！Hope your magpies behave till then🖤✨
[B]:  Tea-proof notebooks? How delightfully paradoxical - like a silent TikTok or a modest influencer. Very well, I'll inform the magpies to confine their literary criticism to the avian press until after our seminar. Do try to arrive before the second bell - the department keeps threatening to install one of those dreadful 'engagement meters' on my door.
