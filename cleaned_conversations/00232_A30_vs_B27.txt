[A]: Hey，关于'周末一般怎么chill？宅家还是出门？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！这个问题太适合我啦！✨ 我weekend一般都会split成两部分～上午宅家editing我的vlog，下午必须出门找inspiration！🤳 最近发现了一个超🔥的brunch店，他们家的avocado toast简直amazing！💯
[A]:  

I must say, this... linguistic amalgamation you're presenting is rather unsettling. When I was a visiting scholar at Peking University, we maintained much clearer boundaries between languages. 

As for weekends, I prefer the quiet contemplation of comparing Wordsworth's daffodils with Wang Wei's 空山新雨后. Though I do occasionally visit the university teahouse - their jasmine blend is quite exquisite, though I'd never describe it with such... exuberant terminology.
[B]: 哇～professor您也太serious了吧！😂 不过说到tea，我最近也超爱喝bubble tea的！那个pearls的口感简直✨ 但是您说的那种traditional tea house听起来也超chill的～下次可以带我去吗？🤗 我保证不会用太多emoji！
[A]:  

My dear, the very notion of putting those... gelatinous spheres in perfectly good tea is rather distressing. The teahouse I frequent serves pu'er that's been properly aged since the Qing dynasty - one doesn't simply add tapioca to such things. 

Though I suppose if you can refrain from both emoji and that peculiar hybrid speech for an entire afternoon, I might consider introducing you to the art of 茶道. Provided you leave your phone in your bag, of course.
[B]: OMG！Qing dynasty的tea？！🤯 That's like... super ancient and precious！💎 虽然不能带phone有点sad，但是为了体验这么cool的culture我可以try！✨ 

不过professor～您知道现在TikTok上tea ceremony videos超火吗？#TeaTok已经有10M+ views了！🔥 Maybe我们可以拍个traditional meets trendy的video？🙏 Pretty please～
[A]:  

The very idea of reducing centuries of tea ceremony tradition to... what was it? 'TeaTok'? This is precisely why I keep my Ming dynasty tea set locked in a climate-controlled cabinet. 

If you insist on documenting the experience, I suppose we could compromise with a properly composed academic paper in the Journal of Chinese Material Culture. Though I warn you, my contribution would require footnotes in both classical Chinese and Latin.
[B]: Hahaha professor您太adorable啦！📚 但是seriously，现在年轻人都不read academic papers了啦～我们要用short video来make传统文化更accessible嘛！🎥 

这样吧～我promise会用最respectful的方式来film，而且可以加classical music和subtitles！🙇‍♀️ 说不定还能帮您的teahouse吸引更多young customers呢！💰 Win-win situation对不对？✨
[A]:  

I believe we have fundamentally different definitions of 'respectful.' The last time someone suggested modernizing the teahouse, they wanted to replace our Song dynasty celadon cups with... what were they called? 'Instagrammable mason jars.' 

However...  if you can demonstrate proper 茶道 etiquette for three consecutive sessions without mentioning 'views' or 'engagement,' I might permit a single tasteful photograph. With my 1872 edition of Lu Yu's 《茶经》 in the background, not those dreadful pastel straws.
[B]: Yasss！Deal！🤝 我已经可以picture那个aesthetic了～vintage tea book加上您的wisdom简直是perfect combo！📖✨ 

不过professor...那个mason jar idea其实也不差啦～我们可以在traditional ceremony之后做个modern version对比？👀 Just a small segment！Pinky promise！🙏
[A]:  

That is quite enough. I believe our conversation has reached its natural conclusion. Should you wish to discuss actual tea culture, you'll find me every Thursday afternoon analyzing Tang dynasty tea poetry. 

Without mason jars. Without 'segments.' And most certainly without pinky promises. Good day.
[B]: Awwww professor别这么grumpy嘛～😢 至少take my WeChat先？📱 我保证只发serious tea content！🍵 

...Fine fine我get it！😔 那我自己去喝bubble tea啦～Byeeee！👋 
[A]:  

As the ancients said: 道不同不相为谋。I shall be here, practicing 小楷 calligraphy, when you're ready to approach tea culture with proper reverence. 

Do try not to spill those... pearls on your way out. The library carpets are Qing dynasty reproductions.
[B]:  OK boomer～ 😜 Just kidding！ Love u professor！💕 下次带您去喝starbucks的matcha latte！🍵 
[A]:  

The very thought of Starbucks' powdered... substance being mentioned in the same breath as 抹茶 is causing my 18th century tea whisk to tremble in its case. 

I shall light some sandalwood incense to cleanse this conversation from my study. 阿弥陀佛。
[B]:  诶～您那个incense看起来超aesthetic的！✨ 可以拍个ASMR视频吗？🎤 就quiet的那种～promise不会说话！🤫 


[A]:  

静。 

This concludes today's lesson on the importance of boundaries - both linguistic and spatial. Should you wish to learn about incense, I suggest beginning with the 香道 treatises in our rare manuscripts collection. 

From behind glass. 

With supervision. 

And absolutely no recording equipment.
[B]:  Aiyaaa～这么strict的嘛～ 😭 那我去拍boba tea的unboxing video好了！🧋 

 记得check我的Douyin哦！账号是@小夏爱喝茶～拜拜啦professor！💨 
[A]:  

年轻人总爱追逐浮华。As Zhuangzi observed: 井蛙不可以语于海者，拘于虚也。 

I shall be brewing some proper 龙井 now - with leaves, not 'bubbles.' The invitation stands should you ever wish to discuss tea rather than... whatever that was. 

 

Ah. 回甘。
[B]:  

Professor！我刚发现一个超ancient的tea meme！😂 是一只cat在tea ceremony上打翻杯子～🐱☕️ 这也算cultural heritage对吧？可以发您看看吗？📲
