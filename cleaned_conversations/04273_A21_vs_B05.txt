[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Interesting question~ 作为一个经常需要做risk assessment的人，我会说mountain trip更符合我的style。在高尔夫球场上我就喜欢那种elevation的变化，而且山里的quiet environment很适合思考一些investment strategy。不过beach也有它的charm，特别是配上杯好的Cabernet Sauvignon 😊
[A]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy of leisure pursuits.  While I typically prefer the solitude of my study with a well-thumbed volume of Tennyson, I must confess mountains hold a particular poetic resonance. There's something Browning-esque about their rugged grandeur - though I'd sooner be translating Li Bai's mountain poems than contemplating stock portfolios amidst the peaks.
[B]: Haha, 看来你也是个appreciate the finer things in life的人啊~ 不过你知道吗？我在读Harvard Business Review的时候看到过一篇研究，说mountain climbing和venture capital investing有很多parallels - 都需要careful planning, calculated risk-taking, 还有最重要的...patience。说到Li Bai，他的"将进酒"配上1982年的Lafite，简直是perfect pairing！
[A]: How delightfully mercantile of you to draw such parallels.  Though I'd argue Li Bai's drunken moon-gazing verses pair better with a humble rice wine than your ostentatious Bordeaux. The true connoisseur knows the most exquisite pleasures often come unadorned - much like Emily Dickinson's dashes or the raw beauty of Wordsworth's daffodils. Tell me, does your venture capital philosophy account for such... unquantifiable aesthetic variables?
[B]:  你这就触及到private equity的art部分了。Every deal has its own poetry - 就像我们最近看的一个biotech startup，他们的cash flow projection可能看起来像free verse，但hidden value就像Li Bai诗里的mountain mist，需要trained eye才能spot。不过说真的，1982 Lafite确实overrated了，我最近更prefer一些boutique winery的hidden gems。毕竟在investment world里，next big thing往往来自unexpected places，right? 😉
[A]:  How very... Silicon Valley of you. Though I suppose there is a certain romanticism in likening cash flows to free verse - if one squints hard enough through rose-tinted spectacles. Personally, I find more reliable returns in the well-trodden paths of Keatsian odes or the structured sonnets of Petrarch. These boutique wineries you mention... do they perchance produce anything worthy of accompanying Milton's Paradise Lost? Or are we still firmly in the realm of Instagrammable investment opportunities?
[B]: Now you're speaking my language! 说到Milton，我最近投资的a small vineyard in Tuscany让我想起Paradise Lost - 他们的Amarone需要整整5年aging period，就像Satan在Hell里的character development一样complex。不过let's be real，在today's market里，Instagrammable factor确实会影响valuation，这就是为什么我们做DCF model时要adjust for social media exposure。但别担心，我的cellar里永远为真正的connoisseur准备了proper vintage~ 🍷
[A]: How perfectly postmodern - to quantify the ineffable through discounted cash flows and hashtag analytics.  Though I must say, comparing divine retribution to tannin development is either blasphemous or brilliant - I haven't decided which. Tell me, does your Tuscan venture include any Dantean circles of hell in its business plan? Or perhaps just the more prosaic circles of supply chain management?
[B]: Haha, brilliant observation! 我们的supply chain确实有9 circles - 从procurement的Limbo到last-mile delivery的Treachery 😈。不过seriously speaking，这就是为什么我们坚持hands-on approach，就像Virgil guiding Dante一样，每个portfolio company都需要personalized guidance。说到这个，你知道我们最近hire了一位former poetry professor做我们的cultural consultant吗？Turns out close reading skills和financial statement analysis有很多transferable skills~
[A]:  You've actually employed one of my beleaguered colleagues? How deliciously subversive. Though I shudder to imagine what Blake would make of his prophetic books being used to forecast quarterly earnings. Still, I suppose there's a certain... tragic beauty in watching the ivory tower's finest parse EBITDA margins with the same fervor they once reserved for metaphysical conceits. Tell me, does your consultant still weep softly when reviewing P&L statements, or has the market hardened their sensibilities entirely?
[B]: Actually，她现在是我们team的rock star！Turns out analyzing John Donne的metaphysical poetry和identifying red flags in balance sheets用到的pattern recognition skills几乎一样。虽然第一次看到DCF model时她确实murmured something about "the death of beauty"... 但现在她能用Derrida的理论来deconstruct我们的competitor analysis了。Life finds a way，就像Jurassic Park里说的~ 🦖
[A]:  How utterly... Jurassic. Though I suppose if dinosaurs can be resurrected through genetic engineering, why not the humanities through financial alchemy? Still, one does wonder - when your consultant deconstructs those competitor analyses, does she leave marginalia in iambic pentameter? Or has Wall Street's prose beaten the poetry out of her entirely?  Another Eurydice lost to the underworld of EBITDA...
[B]: You'd be surprised - 她最近帮我们redraft的investment thesis里偷偷藏了个haiku在footnotes里。大概意思是"Cash flows rising/Like cherry blossoms in spring/Exit multiple" 🌸。我们决定keep it作为公司的Easter egg。毕竟在high finance的世界里，a little poetry never hurt anyone... 虽然legal team坚持要加个disclaimer说这不是financial advice 😂
[A]:  A haiku in the footnotes! How perfectly subversive - like Byron scribbling bawdy limericks in the margins of his banker's ledgers. Though I'd caution your legal team that no disclaimer can contain the revolutionary potential of a well-placed metaphor.  Tell me, does this mark the dawn of a new hybrid discipline? Shall we expect sonnets in SEC filings next? 'How do I love thee? Let me count the basis points...'
[B]: Now that's an idea worth exploring! 想象一下10-K报告里的risk factors用villanelle形式写... "The market may fall, again and again/The Fed keeps hiking, what a pain/Do not go gentle into that good night" 🌙。不过seriously，这可能就是我们industry需要的disruption - 毕竟Warren Buffett说accounting is the language of business，但谁说我们不能add some literary flourish呢？虽然auditors可能会have a heart attack...
[A]:  You've just described either the most thrilling or most terrifying merger since Wordsworth and Coleridge collaborated on Lyrical Ballads. Though I suspect your auditors' coronary episodes would pale in comparison to the apoplexy it would induce in my colleagues on the tenure committee. ...Do keep me apprised when you publish your first iambic earnings call transcript. I'll bring the smelling salts for the analysts.
[B]: Deal! 不过我们得先get past the compliance department... 上次我们试着在pitch deck里引用Frost的"The Road Not Taken"，他们差点revoke我的partner status 🚧。但别担心，我会keep you in the loop - 说不定下次earnings call就能听到我们的CEO drop a subtle Shakespearean quote。毕竟"All the world's a LBO"嘛~ 😎 记得带够smelling salts，Wall Street可不是ready for this level of culture shock!
[A]:  Bravo! Though I fear your compliance department lacks the vision to appreciate such glorious heresy. Should they succeed in suppressing your bardic instincts, do remember there's always a place for you in the ivory tower - we've been putting economic realities in footnotes since Marx was in diapers. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go console my weeping first edition of Adam Smith with some restorative brandy... and perhaps draft a villanelle about regulatory overreach.
[B]: Cheers to that! 🥃 如果all else fails，我们always have poetry slam nights at the private equity retreats... where credit default swaps和Shakespearean insults flow equally freely。Till next time - 记得"To EBITDA or not to EBITDA, that is the question"~ 😏 Keep those smelling salts handy!
