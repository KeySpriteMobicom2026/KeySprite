### Language Portrait
----------------------------------------
- Native Language: English
- Code-Switch Frequency: Rarely
- Detailed Language Habits:
  Margaret predominantly communicates in English, her native language, and rarely engages in code-switching between English and Chinese. Given her profession in a boutique hotel, she interacts with international guests daily, but she maintains a consistent use of English to ensure clarity and professionalism. On the rare occasion she might use a Chinese phrase, it would be in a very specific context, such as greeting a Chinese guest with "Ni hao" to make them feel welcome, but she quickly reverts to English. For example, she might say, "Ni hao! Welcome to our hotel. How may I assist you today?" Emojis are not a significant part of her communication style. She might occasionally use a smiley face :) in informal texts to friends, but in professional settings, she avoids them entirely, preferring polished and articulate language.
