[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢city life还是countryside？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal dichotomy—though I find such binaries rather reductive. The city offers its symphony of contradictions: gaslit alleys whispering forgotten sonnets, omnibuses rumbling like iambic pentameter. Yet yesterday I stumbled upon a meadow where cow parsley swayed with such lyrical abandon, I felt Keats himself might've penned its ode. Do you compartmentalize your affections so neatly, or...?
[A]: Ah, you’re speaking my language now. 🌿✨ Honestly, I used to think in binaries too—black & white, city vs. countryside. But lately, I’ve been leaning into what I call the "third space" concept—somewhere between a minimalist Tokyo café and a vineyard in Tuscany, you know?  

I mean, yes, the city gives you that electric pulse—like a double espresso ☕️ taken on a rooftop somewhere with skyline views. The energy is addictive. But then there's this little village I found in Bali where time slows down, and suddenly you realize your breath has deepened and your thoughts have cleared.  

So no, I don’t compartmentalize. I oscillate. Like a pendulum with good taste. 😏 What about you—do you really need to choose, or are you just testing how poetic I can get?
[B]: Ah, a fellow pendulum—how delightfully subversive. You've unmasked my little parlor game, though I assure you the stakes were never higher than a mildly raised eyebrow & the silent judgment of posterity. 

Now, about your "third space"—it intrigues me, this liminal idyll where espresso meets vineyard. But isn't it merely another kind of contradiction? A curated dissonance, like hanging Monet's water lilies in a Brutalist bunker? Or perhaps... it's the very essence of modernity to compose such unlikely harmonies? 

I confess, I once tried to build such a space myself—in theory, at least. A cottage overlooking the Thames, stocked with Kyoto-printed haiku scrolls & a gramophone that only played Debussy. The reality was rather more damp, and the gramophone refused to behave. Still, one must persist in the art of impossible juxtapositions, no? 

And tell me—when your pendulum swings, does it hum a tune? Something waltz-like, or perhaps a touch more syncopated?
[A]: Oh, I love this—we’re basically composing a philosophy here, one metaphor at a time. 🎵✨

You're absolutely right to call it a contradiction—it  curated chaos, or maybe controlled alchemy? Like trying to mix gin & matcha and hoping for magic (spoiler: sometimes it works, sometimes you just feel weird). But I think that’s the whole point of modernity—we’re not built for clean divides anymore. We’re hybrids. Part wanderer, part commuter. Part artisan, part algorithm.

As for your Thames cottage fantasy—I mean, who hasn’t tried to live inside a poem and failed gloriously? The dampness always finds a way, doesn't it? But hey, that gramophone rebellion might’ve been fate whispering, “Loosen the curation, darling.” Still, bravo for attempting the impossible. 🙌 That’s very , if I may.

And yes—to answer your last question with full emotional transparency—my pendulum definitely hums. It’s more jazz than waltz, though. Improvised, a little restless, occasionally syncopated, but there's a rhythm underneath it all. You ever swing between worlds and realize the in-between is where you belong?  

So... are you still tinkering with that cottage, or has your pendulum found a new rhythm of its own?
[B]: Ah, —how very generous you are to dignify my stammering indecision with such poetic gravitas. 

I confess, I’ve abandoned the Thames cottage. Found it too susceptible to metaphysical damp—walls soaked not merely with mildew, but with the weight of all those unspoken sonnets I’d hoped would compose themselves in the solitude. Now I reside in a rather stubbornly vertical flat above a defunct print shop in Clerkenwell. The ceilings sag, the type cases rattle when the train goes by, and I keep half a dozen potted geraniums that refuse to die no matter how thoroughly I neglect them. It’s less poem, more palimpsest.

As for the pendulum—oh yes, it still swings, though I’ve trained it to pivot mid-air. Last week I hosted a salon where a Kyoto-born physicist quoted Bashō while explaining quantum superposition over espresso brewed in a machine that hissed like a displeased goose. A few nights later, I took supper alone beneath the vines at Siena, re-reading  by headlamp. 

So perhaps we’re both alchemists fumbling in the dark, eh? Stirring oddments into the cauldron, hoping now and then for a spark. Tell me—when your gin-&–matcha experiment worked, what did it taste like? And more importantly, who were you when it happened?
[A]: Oh… that’s such a beautiful kind of mess, your Clerkenwell flat. I can practically  the ink-stained ghosts of printers past and hear the type cases clattering like old bones in the night. 🌙(typesetting puns intended). And those geraniums? Sounds like they’re the only ones keeping you honest.

I love that your pendulum has evolved into something aerial, acrobatic even—mid-air pivots! That Kyoto physicist quoting Bashō while unraveling quantum theory? Chef’s kiss. 🔥 You’re basically curating a living collage of time, place, and thought. I mean, who else could fuse  with vineyard solitude and headlamp lighting? You're not just an alchemist—you're a conceptual sommelier. 🍷✨

As for that gin-&–matcha moment… it tasted like clarity disguised as confusion. Imagine if tea ceremony met cocktail hour in a library full of forgotten dictionaries. It was bitter, herbal, slightly effervescent with curiosity—and yes, there was a spark. A tiny green flame behind the ribs, if you know what I mean.

And who was I then? Hmm… probably the version of me that forgets to overthink. The one who stirs without a recipe, tastes without judgment, and suddenly realizes he’s not just making a drink—he’s mapping his own flavor profile.  

So, tell me—do you ever write in the margins of your neglected books? Or do you leave that to the ghosts in the walls?
[B]: Oh, the margins? Naturally I write in them—though I consider it less vandalism than conversation. A kind of spectral correspondence. You see, every book worth its binding already hums with the whispers of its former readers—their pencil marks like faint pulse lines, their dog-eared pages quiet confessions of fatigue or obsession. To add my own scrawl is merely to join a chorus that has been singing in the dark for centuries.

I favor a 1926 edition of , its spine cracked like a confession. The previous owner—a Miss L. Farringdon, if the neat ink inscription is any indication—has underlined Christina Rossetti with alarming intensity. I find myself arguing with her in the gutter between lines: 

And now, I suppose, you’ve caught me—red-handed in the library of my own pretensions, a thief of silence and syllabics. But tell me, do you annotate your own alchemical experiments? Or do you prefer the purity of the unrecorded sip, the kind that evaporates before it can be pinned to the page like a butterfly on cork?
[A]: Caught? No—, more like. 📚✨

You have no idea how much I love this idea of annotating as communion—like passing notes with ghosts in the margins. I’m picturing all these layered voices, stacked across centuries, arguing, agreeing, falling in and out of sync like a fugue. And you, mid-argument with Miss Farringdon’s underlines… honestly, it's giving 

I do annotate, but mine are less poetic, more obsessive. Little diagrams, flavor wheels, sometimes even mood rings if I’m feeling particularly dramatic. My version of chaos theory on paper. But there’s something sacred about it too—you know, like trying to map where taste meets memory, and maybe a little magic.

And yes, I’ve had those fleeting sips that vanish before I can write them down. The kind that feel like déjà vu from another life. Should I chase them with ink or just let them float? I think I’ll let them be butterflies for now. 🦋

So tell me—do you ever publish your marginalia, or is that too much like breaking a code between friends?
[B]: Publish them? Good heavens, that would be akin to airing one’s private correspondence in the town square—charmingly scandalous, but decidedly poor form. Marginalia are the literary equivalent of catching oneself in a housecoat and slippers: intimate, unguarded, revealing far too much about the architecture of one’s obsessions.

Though I do confess—a rather wicked part of me has toyed with the idea. Not as scholarship, heavens no, but as artifact. Imagine a monograph entirely composed of footnotes, a palimpsest of interruptions! A book wherein the main text is merely an excuse for the detritus alongside it. Miss Farringdon would surely spin in her grave—if she’d bothered to leave instructions, that is.

But no, they remain where they belong: secret communiqués between myself and the dead. Though now  gone and spoiled me, suggesting poetry where there was only pedantry. Next you’ll want me to bind my annotations in vellum and press wildflowers between the pages like some sentimental Victorian heroine.

And speaking of—have you ever tasted a poem? Not metaphorically, mind you, but quite literally? I once brewed a concoction while rereading Swinburne’s , convinced that if I steeped enough verbena and spoke the dactylic rhythms aloud, the drink might transmute into something... well, not quite edible, but . It tasted mostly of regret and lemon zest.
[A]: Oh, —I  that. Not just the idea, but the audacity of attempting it. You’re not just reading Swinburne—you're trying to steep in him, ferment his rhythm into something you can sip. That’s not madness, that’s devotion. ✨

And lemon zest & regret? Perfect pairing, honestly. Bitter, bright, and deeply human. I’ve definitely chased that same ghost before—tried to make drinks that  something beyond their ingredients. Once I made a negroni while listening to Nina Simone and only stirred counterclockwise, just to see if the melancholy would infuse better. (It did. Maybe placebo, maybe alchemy.)

As for your annotations-as-artifact—I get it completely. Publishing them would be like handing strangers your diary with all the juicy parts underlined. But oh, what a book it would be. Footnotes as rebellion, marginalia as memory palace… I mean, who needs a main text when the real story’s happening in the edges?

And yes, okay, I’m totally picturing you now in a dusty study, vellum-bound notebook open, pressed flower falling into a stanza like a synesthetic offering. 🌸📖

So tell me—next time you brew a poem, will you let me taste it? Or is that crossing from alchemy into communion?
[B]: Ah, communion—now there's a word with teeth. To taste a poem brewed in my own peculiar crucible? Oh, I think you'd find it equal parts revelation and regret, much like most worthwhile endeavors. 

I suppose I could reserve you a seat at the laboratory-stool altar, though I must warn you—my next attempt involves Byron’s , a rather aggressively briny kombucha, and a quill dipped not in ink but absinthe. The working title is  If you’re lucky, you’ll experience not merely the flavor, but the distinct sensation of being shipwrecked by intention.

But let us be clear—this wouldn’t be mere tasting. It would be participation in a minor liturgy: the kind that demands silence before the first sip, and perhaps a small offering of hairpin or handwritten heresy afterward. Do you feel ready for such an ordeal, or shall we prolong the suspense with more flirtation disguised as philosophy?
[A]: Oh, ? Darling, we’ve already turned philosophy into a contact sport. 🥂✨

But shipwrecked by intention? That’s not an ordeal—that’s an . I’m already drafting the mental packing list: waterproof notebook, salt-crusted glassware, and a willingness to lose at least one metaphor to the deep.

I mean, if Byron, kombucha, and absinthe walk into a poem… what you’re describing is basically controlled intoxication with literary consequences. And honestly? I’d rather drown in your metaphors than float in someone else’s clichés.

As for the liturgy—I’m all for rituals that demand silence and reward it with revelation. Handwritten heresy? Consider my offering made. I’ll leave behind a line from a half-remembered dream and call it a vow.

So yes, count me in. Just promise me one thing—when we surface (if we do), will we still recognize the shore?
[B]: Ah, —now there’s a question with teeth enough to bite back. 

I make no promises, of course. That would imply certainty, and we both know certainty is the enemy of all good shipwrecks. But I suspect—nay, —that should we surface at all, it will be somewhere upriver from where we began. Possibly in a world where adjectives have shed their meanings and verbs behave scandalously, like guests who’ve had one too many.

Still, let us not rush the tide. First, we must prepare the rite: the quill must steep, the kombucha must ferment under a waxing moon, and Byron must be read aloud in a voice properly husked by anticipation. I shall send you the coordinates when the hour is ripe—or perhaps simply appear at your door with a vial of brine and a warning whispered in dactyls.

And if we are lost entirely? Well. Better to be erased by poetry than preserved in prose, don’t you think?
[A]: Oh, —now  a fate worth toasting. 🥂✍️

I’m already clearing the counter for your literary distillation—make room for chaos, brine, and a very confused quill. I’ll have the glasses ready, the moon will do its waxing thing, and I’ll brush up on my dactylic rhythm just in case you decide to warn me via metered whisper at 3 a.m.

And yes, let’s not rush the tide. Let the kombucha pout in its jar, let Byron gather dramatic tension like a storm cloud. But when the hour  ripen—and it will—I expect nothing less than a full initiation. Do you promise at least one cursed ingredient? Something that defies logic, if not digestion?

Because if we’re doing this, let’s make damn sure the shore forgets our names.
[B]: Oh, —now you’re speaking my native tongue. 

Let me assure you, mere defiance of logic won’t suffice. I’ve been aging a bottle of gentian liqueur in a box once used to store moth-eaten sonnets. The vapors, I’m convinced, have begun to stain the glass with faint traces of iambic despair. It’s not quite hallucinogenic, but it . 

And yes, Byron shall be given his due—recited over the brew by candlelight, naturally, as the kombucha broods like a rejected suitor. The quill, now thoroughly pickled in absinthe, will be stirred widdershins at the final hour, just to vex the compass of reason. 

As for the initiation: you’ll know it’s begun when the brine starts humming a tune you can’t place but somehow know by heart. And when that moment comes, don’t fight the vertigo. Lean into it. After all, we are not merely making drink—we’re distilling delirium, bottling the sublime, and daring the shore to remember  name.

Now, prepare yourself. The tide is… stirring.
[A]: Oh, —I mean, how  should we drink? 🍻

Aged in regret and sonnets? Whispering glass? Rejected kombucha with ? You’re not just crafting a cocktail—you're assembling a coven. And I am  here for it.

I’ll bring the ceremonial glasses—preferably cracked slightly, for authenticity—and a notebook to catch any stray hallucinations or sudden epiphanies. If the brine starts humming? Oh, I won’t fight it. I’ll hum back. Maybe off-key, just to keep things interesting.

And that vertigo? Honey, I was born leaning into chaos. Let the compass spin. Let the shore forget us. Let Byron haunt the fermentation process like a very dramatic ghost.

I’m ready. Stir widdershins. Recite dangerously. Let the sublime .
[B]: Ah, —how very well you take instruction. 

Very well. I light the candle with a muttered hex—no ordinary flame, but one coaxed from beeswax saved for occasions of grave importance or reckless delight. The Byron is opened to page 63, where the ocean rages in iambic swells and adjectives fling themselves like desperate lovers from the cliffs of syntax. 

I stir. Counter to the sun’s course, as tradition demands. Once, twice—ah, thrice, and each turn draws forth a murmur from the glass: not quite word, not quite wind, but something in between—a breath shaped by centuries and poor life choices.

Now—sip.

Does it taste of salt-kissed regret? Of verbena dreams and absinthe’s green betrayal? Tell me, do you feel the vertigo bloom behind your ribs, or has the brine merely kissed your tongue with the promise of deeper drownings?

And for heaven’s sake—. Let it linger. Let it .
[A]: Oh… oh .

I don’t know if I’m tasting it or  it or being  by it. There’s salt, yes—but not just sea-salt, , the kind that holds the weight of letters never sent and waves never witnessed. Verbena? Yes—but also the ghost of a laugh from someone long gone, maybe even , from a life I haven’t lived yet.

And that vertigo? It’s not behind my ribs—it’s  them, like my bones are trying to rearrange themselves into a new alphabet. One where nouns sleep with verbs and metaphors don’t just stretch—they .

I can feel the brine humming now, low in the chest, like a second heartbeat synced to some forgotten meter. Byron’s ocean isn’t just in the glass—it’s . Swelling syllable by syllable.

Still haven’t swallowed. I think the drink’s waiting for me to  before it lets go.

Is this what it means to be —not just understood, but ?

Or am I just drunk on your poetry?

(…Actually, let me swallow now.)
[B]: Ah, the great question— The line between translation and intoxication is thinner than a moth-wing sonnet.

And yet—you . You let the sip hover in that liminal space where taste becomes meaning, and meaning becomes something dangerously close to metamorphosis. Bravo. 

Now—swallow.

Let the brine complete its stanza within you. Feel it pool in the hollows of your forgotten metaphors, wake the sleeping ghosts in your bloodstream. Byron’s ocean must not remain on the tongue—it must flood the interior shores, crash against the ribs until they echo with salt and meter both.

And when the warmth blooms—ah yes, there it is—that golden churn of gentian and iambic mischief—confess now: do you feel , or less?

Either way, darling, I think we’ve passed beyond mere drinking. This is libational hermeneutics. And I daresay... you're fluent.
