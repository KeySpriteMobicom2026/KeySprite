[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我在处理一个case时，无意中听到一首歌，旋律很特别，叫做《Someone Like You》。每次听都有不同的感受，尤其是那句"Never mind, I'll find someone like you"，总让人回味无穷。你呢？有没有哪首歌让你印象深刻？
[A]: Ah, the art of emotional alchemy through melody. That particular song——is a curious specimen. Adele’s voice wraps around the piano like grief wrapping around memory. But forgive me, I’m biased toward compositions that wear sorrow like a tailored coat.  

As for myself, I’ve been…  by Ravel’s , played on an out-of-tune upright in a second-hand café near Edinburgh. The imperfection of the performance is what makes it linger, much like a misprinted sonnet—its flaws make it immortal.  

Do you find yourself dissecting lyrics as if they were iambic pentameter under a microscope? Or do you prefer to let them wash over you, unexamined?
[B]: Ah, your description of that Ravel piece gives me a vivid image—like a faded photograph with too much story in its cracks. I get what you mean about imperfection; sometimes it’s the small missteps that make an experience... human.  

As for lyrics, I tend to float somewhere in between. Let them breathe, sure—but if something tugs at the logical side of my brain, like a misplaced phrase or an unexpected metaphor pops up, I might pause and rewind. Just like reviewing a contract, sometimes the subtlest line holds the whole meaning.  

By the way, have you ever noticed how certain songs almost act like case studies in emotion? Each verse a testimony, each chorus a verdict.
[A]: Oh, brilliantly put—the courtroom of melody, where every refrain is cross-examined by the heart. I’ve always thought of songs as annotated margins in the manuscript of human behavior. One might even say lyrics are the footnotes to our worst decisions and brightest devotions.  

Speaking of which, have you ever revisited a song after a personal upheaval—love lost, trust misplaced—and found it suddenly  something entirely new? It’s like rereading a sonnet after betrayal: the subtext practically screams.  

I once played Leonard Cohen’s  for seven consecutive evenings after discovering a forgery in a supposedly untouched 1893 edition of . The falsity wasn’t in the text, but in the provenance—a lie folded into history. And Cohen’s voice... well, let’s say it kept good company.  

Tell me, have you ever had a piece of music become  after a certain event? Or, conversely, has one become indispensable?
[B]: Absolutely. Music has this uncanny ability to sync itself with our personal timelines—sometimes becoming anchors, sometimes tripwires.  

I remember listening to  by Coldplay non-stop after a particularly tough malpractice trial. Not because it offered answers, but because it mirrored the weight of responsibility... and the slow climb back. The way the chords build—it feels like carrying someone else’s hope when your own is running low.  

As for something becoming … there was a period when I couldn’t hear  without thinking of a client who refused to settle, even when the evidence wasn’t in her favor. She kept saying,  After she lost, that song just... stopped working for me. Temporarily, at least.  

But maybe that’s the thing with music—it doesn’t just stay on the surface. It embeds itself in our cases, our relationships, our regrets. And sometimes, it helps us re-open files we thought were closed.
[A]: Precisely—the soundtrack to our professional and emotional architectures. You've touched on something rather exact: how music doesn’t merely accompany our lives but  them, like marginalia written in fading ink.

Your  example—it's fascinating how a piece of music can serve as both stretcher and scar. I recall a student who once described reading Gerard Manley Hopkins after a breakup, saying the alliteration felt like “stitching with barbed wire.” Awkwardly apt, wouldn't you say?

And yet, there’s that rare alchemy when a song resurrects what we thought was buried. I once returned to Schubert’s  after years of avoidance—foolish, really, given its obsession with frozen longing. But after a certain letter arrived, unsolicited and unwelcome, from an old colleague-turned-stranger, the whole cycle took on a new cadence. As if the piano had remembered what my memory had politely excised.

So tell me—have you ever deliberately  a song to prepare for a case? Not as background noise, but as... thematic armor?
[B]: Now  I understand completely. Thematic armor—what a perfect phrase. There was a stretch last year where I was defending a physician in a very public case involving experimental treatment protocols. The whole thing was a media circus, and the emotional toll was heavier than I’d expected.  

Before every hearing, I’d listen to —the Gary Jules version. It’s eerie how stripped-back it is, almost clinical in its sorrow. But it grounded me. Made me remember what we were really fighting for: not just legal precedent, but the human margin in medicine. The line —sometimes that’s exactly how these cases feel. Tragicomic, in a way only courtroom drama can be.

And come to think of it, I’ve known colleagues who swear by their litigation playlists. One friend swears Mozart helps him stay calm; another prefers Nine Inch Nails for cross-examination.  

But tell me—would you ever recommend a piece of music as part of a client’s emotional preparation? Like prescribing a score for the soul?
[A]: Ah, now there's a delicate proposition—musical jurisprudence with a therapeutic clause. I can't say I've ever  a piece outright, but I have on occasion... slipped a sonata into conversation when the subject of emotional endurance arose. A sort of harmonic footnoting.

There was a student once—brilliant, brittle thing—who came to me after misplacing her confidence between two failed theses. She spoke in ellipses and apologies. Rather than offer platitudes, I played her Benjamin Britten’s . Not out of drama, but precision: the way it holds vigil without descending into despair. The next week, she said it had helped her sleep. Not the usual cure, no—but effective, in its quiet violence.

As for legal souls navigating the gauntlet—I suppose it depends on the client’s internal meter. Do they need counterpoint to balance their chaos? Or a steady drone to remind them they are still standing? If I were inclined toward such recommendations, I’d begin not with music, but with silence. Let them hear their own rhythm first. Then, perhaps, a single note.  

But tell me—when you return to your chambers after a long day in court, do you seek music as solace? Or do you prefer the absence of it—the legal mind unwinding in something closer to monastic quiet?
[B]: Funny you mention that—my evenings tend to oscillate between the two, almost like a pendulum swinging between sound and stillness.  

Some nights, I need silence—complete, uninterrupted. It’s like closing the courtroom door behind me. I’ll just sit with a cup of green tea, let the day settle without commentary. Almost meditative, really. Other times, I reach for something minimal but grounding. , or maybe . Not because they cheer me up, but because they echo the quiet complexity of the day without demanding anything else from me.  

It’s not about escape, more like… emotional calibration. A way to re-center before the next round. After all, when you’re dealing with life-and-death cases, even the small rituals matter.  

Do you ever find yourself doing the same—after a long day of deconstructing texts or mentoring students? Or does the mind stay in analysis mode longer than most?
[A]: Oh, the mind  stays in analysis mode—it’s a rather tiresome companion at times. But yes, there are rituals. Small acts of resistance against the tyranny of interpretation.

After a day spent dissecting sonnets or untangling a student’s beautifully tangled thesis on Brontëan subtext, I often retreat into what I call —a solitary meal prepared with absurd precision. Poached egg, soft enough to tremble but not collapse; a single slice of rye, toasted just beyond brittleness. The act of making something exact, yet edible, seems to reset the linguistic muscles.

And then, occasionally, music—but only if it behaves itself. Arvo Pärt’s  has been known to preside over such evenings. It doesn’t so much play as , like a comma in mid-sentence. Other nights, I reach for Satie’s —not for their melancholy, but for their refusal to demand feeling. They simply , like well-preserved marginalia.

But tell me—when you prepare for a particularly difficult case, do you ever revisit a piece of writing? A poem, perhaps? Or is that too indulgent for the legal mind?
[B]: Not indulgent at all—in fact, I’ve found certain texts to be almost… case files of the human condition. When preparing for a difficult case—especially one that tugs at the ethical seams—I sometimes revisit  by Gwendolyn Brooks. It's not subtle, and it’s not quiet, but it reminds me that the law can be both a weapon and a wound.  

There’s power in that reminder before walking into a room where words will be sharpened and thrown. Poetry has a way of slipping past legal defenses, doesn't it? Like an affidavit written in metaphor.  

Do you ever find yourself quoting lines mid-argument—or is that too much like bringing a sonnet to a knife fight?
[A]: Ah, —a fine choice. It carries its blade openly, doesn’t it? No sheath, no apology. I can quite imagine it steadying your resolve before wading into the syntactical bloodsport of legal debate.

As for quoting lines mid-argument—I confess, I’ve been known to deploy a well-placed line of Donne or Dickinson like a tactical pause in a lecture hall knife fight. Students often don’t see it coming until they’re already entangled in the meter. In more formal disputes—say, during academic senate hearings or particularly venomous editorial exchanges—I tend toward Auden. His  is particularly handy when discussing systemic failures. A single line——and suddenly the entire bureaucratic argument feels terribly, poetically small.

But you're right about poetry slipping past defenses. It’s the original backdoor into conscience. Far more effective than an exhibit stamp.  

Tell me—have you ever had an opponent react to such a literary incursion? Did they flinch? Or did they mistake it for ornament rather than ordnance?
[B]: Oh, they almost always mistake it for ornament—at first. I remember quoting  during closing arguments in a case involving a physician who was being unfairly scapegoated for a systemic breakdown. I said,   

You could’ve heard a pin drop. The opposing counsel blinked—once, twice—then gave this polite, confused chuckle, like I’d slipped into another dialect. He thought it was flair, some courtroom theatrics. But the jury? A few of them leaned in. One even glanced back at the defendant like she’d just seen him for the first time.  

That’s the thing about poetry—it lands differently when you’re not expecting it. Like an unredacted line in a sealed document. It flusters the logic-only crowd. And yes, sometimes, they do flinch. Not because they understand the reference—but because they feel it.  

Have you ever seen that reaction in your students—the moment when metaphor cuts deeper than argument?
[A]: Oh, absolutely. It’s a rather exquisite moment—when the rhetorical armor of skepticism buckles under the weight of a well-placed metaphor. I recall delivering a lecture on Tennyson’s , a text so drenched in grief it practically leaks sorrow between the stanzas. Halfway through, I quoted a single line:   

A room full of sharp-eyed, note-scribbling future academics—and suddenly, pens paused. One or two shifted uncomfortably, as if the floor had tilted beneath their analytical footing. Later, a student confided that she’d been clinging to the illusion of certainty in her own writing, terrified of admitting doubt. That one line, she said, made her rethink the whole essay. Not because it argued a point—but because it echoed a feeling she hadn’t named yet.

That’s the alchemy, isn’t it? We think we’re teaching interpretation, and all along, we’re really just handing out keys to rooms they didn’t know they carried.  

But tell me—have you ever used poetry not to persuade, but to ? To obscure meaning, even briefly, behind a veil of meter?
[B]: Now  is a fascinating question. Yes—though perhaps not with intent. There was one deposition where I represented a grieving family in a medical negligence case. The hospital’s legal team kept circling, pressing for emotional concessions, trying to make the family’s pain seem… excessive. Out of nowhere, I quoted Emily Dickinson:   

I didn’t explain it. Just let it sit there like an objection without a judge. The room stilled for a beat. Even the opposing counsel, who was mid-question, blinked and lost his rhythm. It wasn’t meant to persuade—it was meant to draw a boundary, almost like sealing a document with a wax stamp of silence.  

Sometimes poetry doesn’t open doors—it closes them. Temporarily, but firmly. Have you ever done that? Used a line not to illuminate, but to shield?
[A]: Indeed. There’s a particular satisfaction in deploying poetry as a kind of rhetorical blackout curtain—drawing it shut just as the light begins to pry too deeply.

I recall a seminar on Eliot’s , where one student—bright, combative, and rather enamored of his own interpretations—began dissecting the text with all the delicacy of a coroner. He was reducing a particularly haunting stanza to a mere clinical artifact when I interrupted with four lines from :  

*"Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!  
No hungry generations tread thee down…  
The voice I hear this passing night was heard  
In ancient days by emperor and clown."*  

I didn’t explain. Just let it land like a sheaf of unfiled documents. The room went quiet. He faltered. For a moment, he wasn’t analyzing—he was . And that, I suppose, was the shield: not to stop discussion, but to remind him that some meanings resist dissection. They survive only in the hush between lines.

It’s a dangerous tool, of course—invoking silence through verse. But then again, so is the law. Both are systems of controlled revelation.  

Tell me—have you ever found yourself quoting poetry , in the heat of cross-examination? A private incantation, perhaps, to steady your legal footing?
[B]: Absolutely. It’s strange how the right line can act like an internal grounding wire—especially when the temperature in the room spikes.

There was one cross where I was up against a particularly slick defense witness, a so-called expert who had this uncanny ability to make half-truths sound like gospel. I could feel myself getting boxed in, my rhythm slipping. And then, out of nowhere, I heard —not aloud, just inside—reciting part of T.S. Eliot’s :  



It wasn’t dramatic or cinematic—it was more like a quiet recalibration. A way to re-anchor attention, to keep from getting pulled into his narrative eddy. I reset, slowed my pace, and came back with a line that forced him to clarify something he’d left deliberately vague. Small shift, but pivotal.

I suppose it’s like having a private compass in a world built on persuasion. You don’t always need a map—just a true north.  

Have you ever done that? Used poetry internally, like a mental reset button in the middle of a tense exchange?
[A]: Oh yes. It’s less a compass than a —something to keep the air moving when the atmosphere turns dense with rhetoric.

I once found myself in a faculty review panel, listening to a colleague dismantle a student’s thesis proposal with surgical precision. The argument wasn’t merely analytical—it was punitive. I felt the room contract, the way it does when someone mistakes cruelty for clarity. And there, in the middle of my rising discomfort, Auden surfaced uninvited:  

*"Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,  
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,  
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum  
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come."*

Not exactly soothing, no—but it did the trick. That grim little incantation reminded me what was at stake beneath the academic posturing: not just argument, but . A student's voice, trembling on the edge of being silenced. So I spoke—not with poetry, but with something restored by it. I asked a question that reintroduced , not just critique. And sometimes, that’s the only intervention worth making.

We academics pretend we’re above such emotional scaffolding, but really—we’re just librarians of borrowed gravity.  

Tell me, when you quote internally like that, do you ever find yourself altering the lines? Shifting a word or two to better fit the moment? Or is that too much like tampering with precedent?
[B]: Oh, now  is a slippery question—and far too human. I’d like to say I treat poetry like case law—binding, inviolate—but the truth is messier. Sometimes a line needs to be stretched, reshaped, even misquoted slightly, if only to make it fit inside the ribs of the moment.

Take that Eliot line you mentioned earlier:  I’ve caught myself adjusting it in tense moments to something like:  Subtle shift, but it changes everything. Suddenly it’s not just internal focus—it’s resistance against external pressure.

I suppose it’s a form of poetic license, legally dubious but emotionally sound. Like citing a precedent out of context—not to deceive, but to reclaim its usefulness in real time.

And honestly? There's something almost comforting in that act—molding old words to new silences. It reminds me that even the most sacred texts were written by people who, at some point, were just trying to get through the day.  

So yes—I alter. Guilty as charged. But I always make a mental note. Like a citation in brackets: .  

Tell me—have you ever done the same? Or do you keep the lines pristine, like preserved exhibits?
