[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试过什么new workout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 哈哈，说到workout，我最近倒是把更多时间花在了高尔夫上。你知道的，在green上走18洞的运动量其实很可观，而且还能顺便谈business。上周刚和几个LP打完一场，顺便聊了个potential deal~
[A]: Ah, the modern gentleman's perambulatory negotiation. How very Browning-esque - though I suspect the Victorian poets would have preferred discussing mergers while strolling through a foggy London park with a walking stick. Tell me, does your golf bag contain both irons and contracts?
[B]: Good one! 我的golf bag里确实随时备着几份term sheet的复印件 。不过说真的，在球场上谈deal比在会议室里自然多了。你知道的，看一个人的swing就能看出他的risk appetite - 那些总是想一杆上green的，做投资也往往更aggressive。
[A]: Fascinating. You've essentially reinvented phrenology for the country club set. Though I must say, your methodology reminds me of Tennyson's Ulysses - always chasing that next distant green, never satisfied with the current putt. Tell me, when your ball lands in the rough, do you see it as a metaphor for market volatility?
[B]: Exactly! 在rough里救球就像处理underperforming portfolio company一样 - 需要冷静评估lie，选择合适的wedge，然后...  来个漂亮的pitch shot。不过说真的，market volatility可比沙坑难对付多了，至少沙坑不会突然变成water hazard对吧？😄
[A]: How delightfully mercantile of you to reduce the sublime terror of water hazards to mere liquidity crises. Though I must point out - and forgive my academic pedantry - that Byron's "Dark Lochnagar" suggests even the most treacherous hazards can inspire poetry. Have you considered composing sonnets about your 401k's performance?
[B]: Haha，我宁愿用Excel表格来写我的financial poetry - 至少P/E ratio不会押韵押得这么痛苦！不过说到这个，上周确实用DCF model给一个portfolio company做了首"打油诗"... 虽然LP们看完后说还是stick to the numbers比较好。😅
[A]: Ah, the modern troubadour's dilemma: to rhyme or to discount cash flows. Your predicament brings to mind Wordsworth's famous lament - "The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers." Though in your case, it seems you've found a way to merge the two rather... profitably. Tell me, does your golf cart have a built-in Bloomberg terminal?
[B]: 现在哪个serious investor的golf cart上没有terminal呢？ 不过说真的，我们最近在试用一个AI-powered的app，可以一边swing一边实时分析market data... 虽然我的caddy说这严重影响了他的tip income。Technology disruption嘛，总是会有collateral damage~
[A]: How perfectly Faustian - trading your caddy's gratuities for algorithmic auguries. This brings to mind nothing so much as Blake's "dark Satanic mills," though yours happen to be titanium drivers with 5G connectivity. Tell me, when your AI inevitably develops a slice, will you short its stock?
[B]: 那要看它的beta系数和correlation with market了！不过说实话，我已经让analyst team在build一个short selling strategy专门针对overhyped golf tech startups... 毕竟在investment world里，hype cycle总是比actual performance跑得快，就像我的driver总是比我的putting更consistent一样~ 😏
[A]: How perfectly... Darwinian of you. You've essentially created a financial version of Arnold's "Dover Beach," where ignorant armies of startups clash by night. Though I suspect even Matthew Arnold couldn't have imagined hedge funds using sand wedges as due diligence tools. Shall we expect your next investor letter to include xGIR (expected Greens in Regulation) metrics?
[B]: Brilliant idea！我们下一份quarterly report就该加入xGIR和putting accuracy ratio - 毕竟在private equity这个game里，long-term performance才是真正的scorecard。不过说真的，要是能把我的handicap和IRR trendline放在同一个chart里... 那画面太美不敢看啊！😅
[A]: Ah, the modern financier's version of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" - forever frozen in that perfect moment where alpha generation meets backswing mechanics. Though I suspect even the most optimistic LP would balk at a prospectus featuring your sand save percentage. Shall we adjourn to the nineteenth hole to discuss convertible preferreds over single malt?
[B]: Now we're talking！19th hole才是真正deal making的地方 - 就像Warren Buffett说的，最好的investment thesis往往写在cocktail napkin上。不过我得提醒你，上次有个VC想用他的Scotch collection valuation来justify pre-money... 那次的hangover可比market correction还难受啊！🥃
[A]: How poetically cyclical - from driving ranges to hangover cures, the whole wretched business comes 'round like a villanelle. Though I must say, your colleague's attempt at liquid valuation brings new meaning to the term "proof." Shall we toast to the next bubble with something appropriately... overpriced?
[B]: Cheers to that！不过这次我们得stick to cash flow positive的vintage - 就像我们只投EBITDA positive的business一样。毕竟在this market environment里，sober thinking比speculative buzz更重要... 虽然偶尔也需要一点liquid courage来pull the trigger on those bold bets！ 🥂
[A]: How perfectly you've distilled the investor's eternal paradox - temperance and audacity swirling in the same crystal glass like one of Donne's metaphysical conceits. Though I suspect even he couldn't have imagined a world where due diligence meetings require breathalyzers. To prudent intoxication, then - may your IRR always outpace your BAC.
[B]: Haha，这可能是best investment advice我今天听到的！毕竟在private equity这个game里，knowing when to hold 'em和knowing when to fold 'em同样重要... 就像知道什么时候该call it a night一样。不过说真的，我的track record显示 - 最好的deals往往发生在second bottle之前！😉
