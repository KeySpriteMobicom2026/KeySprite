[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到new craft beer，我最近在精酿啤酒节上尝到了一款Double IPA，酒精度居然有9.2%，口感特别浓郁。不过说实话，现在国内的精酿市场真的越来越卷了，很多品牌都在玩fusion flavor，比如我上周喝到一款加了普洱茶和洛神花的艾尔啤酒，酸酸涩涩的还挺有意思。对了，你最近有去70craft或者京A吗？他们新出的limited edition你喝过了没？
[A]: Oh, that does sound intriguing—though I must confess, my palate remains rather partial to the subtler notes of a well-balanced porter or perhaps a Belgian witbier. Still, I admire the creativity behind those fusion flavors. I did stop by 70craft last week, and they were serving a limited batch infused with Sichuan peppercorn and tangerine peel—quite bold! Not quite my usual cup of tea, but I appreciate the experimentation. Have you tried anything from Boxing Cat Brewery lately? Their seasonal releases often have an interesting literary theme, which I find charming.
[B]: Oh definitely, I’ve always found the literary-themed labels from Boxing Cat Brewery super charming too! Their latest seasonal release, “The Old Man and the Sea” – a White IPA with hints of grapefruit and coriander – was actually pretty aligned with my taste. I do appreciate how they tie the beer profile to the story in the tasting notes. That Sichuan peppercorn and tangerine peel combo from 70craft sounds wild though – I love how Chinese ingredients are finally getting more spotlight in craft brewing. It’s almost like terroir meets innovation, you know? Have you tried pairing those fusion-style beers with any specific foods? I feel like some of them could really stand up to bold flavors.
[A]: Ah, yes—I quite agree. There’s something poetic about blending terroir with innovation, as you put it. I recently tried a pairing that surprised me: that Sichuan peppercorn-infused beer from 70craft actually held its own beautifully against a dish of mapo tofu. The spice and numbing heat in the food seemed to echo the boldness in the brew, creating a kind of harmony I hadn’t anticipated. 

I also experimented with the普洱茶和洛神花 ale—though I haven’t seen it widely available yet. I had a small taste at a friend’s gathering, and I found its tart, earthy notes paired wonderfully with aged goat cheese and even dark chocolate. It’s fascinating how these new flavor profiles push us to rethink traditional pairings.

Have you found any particularly daring combinations yourself? I’m always curious to hear how others approach these unconventional brews.
[B]: Oh, I love that mapo tofu pairing—it makes total sense! The numbing heat from the Sichuan peppercorn and the麻辣 from the dish must’ve created this crazy synergy. That’s exactly the kind of bold experimentation I live for.

As for daring combinations—I actually tried that普洱茶&洛神花 ale with a smoked duck spring roll, and honestly? The smokiness from the duck plus the slight tartness of the beer felt almost like a controlled collision—intense but in a good way. I also went a bit wild last weekend and paired a chili-chocolate stout with grilled octopus... It didn’t sound like it should work, but somehow the richness of the stout softened the briny bite of the seafood, and the chili kick just elevated the whole thing.

I totally get what you mean about rethinking traditional pairings—these brews are basically forcing us to rewrite the rulebook. Have you ever gone full mad scientist and tried creating your own infusion at home? I’ve been toying with the idea of adding dried osmanthus & star anise to a Belgian dubbel. Just not sure if it’ll end up tasting like grandma’s cupboard or a Michelin-star surprise 🤔.
[A]: Oh, I adore that smoked duck spring roll pairing—what a brilliant collision of flavors! It’s thrilling to see how these beers can hold their own against such complex, layered dishes. As for going full mad scientist at home—I’ve dabbled, though perhaps not quite as ambitiously as your osmanthus and star anise Belgian dubbel concept! I once brewed a small batch infused with dried hibiscus and a whisper of ginger root—turned out surprisingly well with a slight tartness and a warming finish.  

I wouldn’t worry too much about it tasting like grandma’s cupboard; after all, isn’t that sometimes where the best culinary magic begins? If you do give it a go, I’d love to hear how it turns out—maybe even sneak in a small tasting session if you’re feeling generous! Have you ever thought about documenting your pairings or brewing experiments? It could be a delightful little zine or blog—part gastronomy, part literary endeavor.
[B]: Haha, a tasting session sounds like a plan—I’ll hold you to that! Your hibiscus & ginger homebrew sounds right up my alley, by the way. There's something so satisfying about coaxing unexpected flavors out of familiar ingredients. I might have to steal that idea for a future experiment... with credit, of course 😄.

As for documenting the pairings and brewing madness—actually, I’ve been jotting down notes in a little leather-bound journal, mostly late at night after dinner tastings. It started as just a personal log, but now that you mention it, turning it into a zine or blog could be fun. Maybe something called ? Part product manager musings, part flavor geekery. I could even throw in some sci-fi themed beer labels as a nod to my weekend book club.  

You should definitely contribute a guest post sometime—we’d call it “From Mapo Tofu to Malt Notes: A Fusion Palate Explored” or something equally dramatic. What do you think?
[A]: Oh, I  that name—The Side Hustle Brewer! It has such a delightful air of secret passion projects and late-night kitchen experiments. And a sci-fi themed beer label? Genius. I can already picture a Nebula IPA or a Martian Lager with tasting notes that read like an Asimov novel.  

As for contributing—well, how could I resist such an enticing editorial invitation? A guest post sounds like tremendous fun, though I think we’ll need a slightly more dramatic title still… perhaps ? Or maybe something even more alluringly eccentric. You know I enjoy a bit of flourish.

Do let me know when you're ready to launch—I shall be your first subscriber, pen at the ready for spirited commentary in the margins.
[B]: Haha, I can already see the封面设计 — maybe a steaming beaker of beer with stardust swirling out of it, right? And yes, your title tweak is  — it has that mad-scientist-in-a-lab-coat-meets-poet vibe we’re going for.  

I’m thinking launch sometime after mid-Autumn Festival — gives me just enough time to brew something weird and document the process without making it look like a chemistry lab exploded. I’ll definitely send you a preview copy before going live; I’d love your thoughts on tone and theme. Maybe even include a QR code in the first issue that plays a dramatic reading of a tasting note by yours truly 🎭.

And rest assured — once we go live, I expect your comments to be as spicy as that Sichuan peppercorn beer. Bring the🔥.
[A]: Oh, I  the image of a steaming beaker with stardust — it captures that perfect intersection of science and whimsy. You know, perhaps we could even add a tiny quill hovering above the foam, taking its own tasting notes. Pure whimsy, of course, but then again—so is blending普洱茶 with ale.

A dramatic reading via QR code? My dear, you are speaking my language now. I may just record mine by candlelight, in a velvet cloak, while a storm rages outside — or at least the kettle whistles on the stove. 

And spicy commentary? Oh, you shall have it. Prepare your inbox for remarks like,  or   

I do hope you’re ready for literary criticism meets craft beer analysis. It’s a niche genre, but I believe in its potential.
[B]: Oh, now you’re just showing off — and I . A quill taking tasting notes? Genius. I’m half-convinced it’ll start editing my drafts if I’m not careful. 🖋️✨

And yes, dramatic readings by candlelight in a velvet cloak — absolutely essential for proper beer criticism. I may go one step further and narrate mine in a suspiciously theatrical accent while holding a glass up to the light like some kind of malt sommelier. 🍻

As for your inbox-burning commentary… please, don’t hold back. I live for feedback that sounds like it was written by a 19th-century poet with a secret drinking problem.  — I’m already drafting a reply titled 

This niche genre of yours? I think we just found our USP. Let’s call it . Or maybe . Either way, I’m in — ink-stained, slightly tipsy, and ready for launch.
[A]: Oh, —I could practically hear it whispered in the voice of a BBC narrator just now. It has that perfect blend of the elevated and the absurd, don’t you think? I can already picture it emblazoned on the cover in gilded cursive, above that steaming, stardust-laced beaker of yours.

And ? Tempting—though I fear we might get mistaken for a journal on hydrodynamics with literary aspirations. Still, one never knows where inspiration may strike... or spill, as the case may be.

As for your dramatic tasting narration—I do hope you’ll include a Latin motto beneath the title, something like —you know, just to lend it that air of scholarly debauchery.

I, too, am ink-stained, slightly tipsy, and ready. Let us raise our glasses to the birth of a truly peculiar yet promising endeavor. To —may it bewilder, may it inspire, and may it pair beautifully with a well-aged saison.
[B]: To  — may it bewilder, may it inspire, and may we somehow convince a sommelier to take us seriously 🥂.

I’m already scribbling potential taglines in the margins:  
  
And yes, that Latin motto? Pure genius. I’m half-tempted to get it printed on custom bottle caps just to feel extra bougie.

Oh, and speaking of pairings — I think your saison suggestion is dangerously close to being the theme for Issue #0.5 (a preview issue, naturally). We could call it  and feature early tastings, experimental brews, and maybe even a short fiction piece soaked in beer notes. Just enough to lure in both the literary crowd  the hop-heads.

Alright, I think we’ve officially crossed into beautifully absurd territory. Let’s not look back.
[A]: To —and to the beautifully absurd! 🥂 I do love your thinking with Issue #0.5— is nothing short of inspired. There’s something so very  about it, don’t you think? A saison swirling with meaning, memory, and perhaps a touch of fermentation-induced introspection.

I shall begin drafting a short piece at once—something along the lines of  It will be brooding, slightly overwrought, and absolutely perfect for our tone. And if we can't find a sommelier to take us seriously, well then—we shall simply pour them a beer until they do.

Oh, and by all means, print that motto on bottle caps. We must lean into the bougie where we can—it's all part of the brand.  May our stories flow as freely as our brews.
[B]: I’m practically vibrating with editorial excitement here — ? Oh, we are absolutely printing that in 12pt serif font on recycled kraft paper. Maybe with a faint watermark of a contemplative monk brewing in a shadowy abbey. Pure. Atmosphere.

And yes, lean into the overwrought brooding — this is , after all. If it doesn’t make someone sip slowly while gazing out a rainy window, are we even trying?

I’ll get the bottle caps ordered this week. Probably also stamp them with a tiny QR code linking to a whispered narration of your piece. Because why stop at bougie when we can go full ?

To saison-fueled introspection, fermented metaphors, and the slow, noble descent into beer-induced philosophy. Issue #0.5 is already shaping up to be a masterpiece... or a glorious mess. Either way, it’s ours.
[A]: Ah, I can already  the weight of that kraft paper between my fingers—so gloriously tactile, like holding a manifesto for the over-caffeinated and under-slept. A contemplative monk watermark? Exquisite. I may weep into my saison at the sheer aesthetic cohesion of it all.

And whispered narration via QR code? Oh, now  is inspired. Imagine: a softly spoken voice in the dim light of one’s kitchen, uttering lines like  while one stirs a pot of soup far too late at night. It’s not just a beer—it’s a full sensory experience.

Let us embrace the descent, my friend. Let us sip slowly, brood deeply, and occasionally forget what day it is—all in the name of fermented artistry. To , Issue #0.5—may it haunt bookshelves and brewery corners alike.
[B]: To , Issue #0.5 — may it haunt, may it linger, and may it gently hum with the melancholy of a saison that's seen things.

I’m already drafting my late-night narration script:  
  

Honestly, I think we've stumbled onto something dangerously beautiful here. It’s not just beer—it’s bottled mood. Fermented philosophy. A slow-burning obsession wrapped in paper and glass.

And yes, let us forget what day it is. Let us lose ourselves in this absurdly elegant rabbit hole. If anyone asks where we’ve gone, tell them we're off editing by candlelight, one metaphor—and one glass—at a time.

May our stories be bitter, our aftertaste long, and our bottle caps forever gilded in irony. 🥂
[A]: Ah, that narration script—. I may have to steal a line for my own piece. There’s something so exquisitely tragic about  and . It’s the kind of prose that makes one want to sip slowly and sigh deeply, preferably in a dimly lit room where the outside world feels very far away.

You’re absolutely right—it  bottled mood, fermented philosophy. Each brew a stanza, each pour a paragraph in a poem we’re only beginning to write.

So let us descend further into this rabbit hole, shall we? Let us lose all sense of time and reason, and emerge—somewhat sticky-fingered, slightly drunk on vision and barley alike—with something truly singular.

To : may it haunt, linger, hum—and may no one take it too seriously, least of all us.

Cheers, dear editor, co-conspirator, fellow dreamer. 🥂  
Onward to Issue #0.5—and whatever madness comes after.
[B]: Cheers, indeed — dear co-conspirator, fellow dreamer, and now officially my favorite enabler of beer-fueled literary madness 🥂.

I’ll be sure to leave a margin note for you in the script:  And honestly? I think it elevates the whole piece. That line belongs in a gallery… or at least on the back label of a limited release bottle we’ll never afford to mass-produce.

Let’s absolutely lose ourselves in this thing. If we come out the other side slightly wiser, mildly buzzed, and covered in ink stains and barley dust, then mission accomplished.

To Foam & Fable — may it remain forever gloriously impractical, beautifully unnecessary, and absurdly meaningful to those who find it. Onward to Issue #0.5… and whatever beautiful chaos follows.

Pen ready. Glass raised. Vision delightfully blurred. 🍻
