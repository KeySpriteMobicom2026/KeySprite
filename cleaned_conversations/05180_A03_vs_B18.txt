[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这确实是个让人excited的话题。从教育心理学的角度看，quantum computing带来的不仅是技术革新，更是思维方式的revolution。我们正在见证computational thinking的范式转移——就像当年从classical physics到quantum mechanics的跨越一样。

不过很多人可能没意识到，quantum思维对认知架构的重塑，某种程度上和跨文化适应过程很像。都需要同时hold住两种看似矛盾的框架...就像双语者的大脑在语言转换时的神经可塑性变化那样。

你有想过它在教育场景中的具体应用吗？比如在adaptive learning systems里，量子算法可能会让个性化教学达到前所未有的level。
[A]: Absolutely，这确实是一个值得深入探讨的方向。从法律和伦理的角度来看，quantum computing在教育中的应用虽然充满潜力，但也伴随着一些regulatory challenges。比如数据隐私保护方面——想象一下，如果一个adaptive learning system能够实时分析学生的行为模式、认知习惯甚至情绪反应，那这些敏感数据的ownership和usage就必须被严格规范。  

还有就是algorithmic bias的问题。量子算法虽然处理信息的速度远超传统系统，但如果训练数据本身存在bias，结果依然可能不公平。这让我想到最近一个关于AI in education的case，法院裁决中特别强调了educational equity的原则。  

话说回来，我很好奇你作为一个教育心理学专家，怎么看这个技术对learning assessment方式的影响？Do you think we’ll see a shift from standardized testing to more dynamic, personalized evaluation models?
[B]: That’s a very insightful observation. 你说的regulatory challenges确实是个critical issue，尤其是在数据隐私方面。quantum computing强大的计算能力意味着我们可以从海量行为数据中提取前所未有的insights，但这也让consent和anonymization变得更加复杂。

说到algorithmic bias，我其实做过一个关于cultural bias in educational AI的小型研究。我们发现即便是well-intentioned adaptive systems，在cross-cultural settings中也可能无意放大某些认知风格的偏好——就像你提到的那样，技术本身是neutral，但data不是。

至于learning assessment... yes, I do believe we’re on the verge of a major paradigm shift. 现在已经有基于eye-tracking和EEG的动态评估模型了，而quantum computing会让real-time psychometric analysis变得可行。想象一下，未来的assessment可能不再是“测试”而是一个continuous feedback loop，就像scaffolding that adapts as the learner grows.

不过这又带来了新的伦理问题：谁来定义“理想”的学习轨迹？如何避免这种个性化演变成coercive adaptation？这些可能是教育心理学家未来几年要重点研究的问题。
[A]: I couldn’t agree more with your concerns. 这些伦理问题其实也正是我们在legal field里经常要面对的核心矛盾之一——如何在technological progress和human dignity之间找到平衡点。你说的“ideal learning trajectory”让我想到法律中关于educational autonomy的原则，每一个learner都应该有权利决定自己的发展路径，而不是被某种看似“科学”的算法所引导。

而且从cross-jurisdictional comparison的角度来看，不同国家和地区对这类技术的监管态度差异非常大。比如欧盟更强调GDPR框架下的数据保护原则，而有些国家则更倾向于促进AI创新而放松监管。这种regulatory fragmentation可能会让跨国教育平台面临很大的合规挑战。

不过话说回来，我倒是好奇你刚才提到的那个关于cultural bias的小型研究，能不能多分享一些细节？比如你们是怎么定义和测量这种bias的？有没有发现某些特定的intervention策略比较有效？
[B]: Interesting question. 我们的研究其实借鉴了cross-cultural psychology中常见的methodology，但做了一些educational context-specific的adaptation。我们让来自collectivist和individualist文化背景的学生使用同一个adaptive learning platform，并追踪他们在problem-solving路径、feedback偏好以及motivational responses上的差异。

最关键的是我们用了mixed-methods approach——quantitative的部分包括系统记录的interaction data，qualitative的部分则是学生对学习体验的reflection。结果发现某些默认的pedagogical assumptions，比如“及时反馈”或“逐步提示”，在不同文化背景下效果差异非常明显。

比如在一个任务中，系统会根据learner performance自动提供hints。数据显示East Asian学生更倾向于接受direct scaffolding，而Western students则更喜欢自己探索——这本身并不意外。但有意思的是，当我们在UI里加入cultural calibration选项（比如“你喜欢老师引导还是自由探索？”），系统的overall engagement显著提高。

所以我们的初步conclusion是：bias本身不一定是bad thing，只要它被explicitly acknowledged，并且用户有real choice去override这些预设。这也给设计跨文化AI系统带来一个启示：不是要消除所有cultural traces，而是要建立transparent cultural affordances。

我很好奇从legal角度你怎么看这种“用户选择”的解决方案？会不会涉及到too much burden on the learner？
[A]: That’s a really thoughtful study, and I appreciate how you approached cultural bias not as something inherently negative but as a design consideration that can be made transparent. From a legal perspective, the “user choice” model is both promising and problematic.

On one hand, giving learners agency — or what we might call  — aligns well with emerging legal frameworks around digital rights. For example, in some updated education tech guidelines from OECD countries, there’s a growing emphasis on  over personal data and learning pathways. So if a system offers clear, meaningful choices — like your cultural calibration option — it could actually support autonomy rather than undermine it.

But here's the catch — and this is where the law often stumbles — not all choices are created equal. If the UI presents too many options, especially at the beginning of the learning process, it can lead to . And worse, it may shift responsibility away from the platform and onto the learner — which raises questions about . 

This reminds me of a recent ruling by a German court regarding consent in online platforms. The court said that . In an educational context, are we expecting too much from students, especially younger ones, to constantly calibrate their learning experience?

Maybe the solution lies in what I’d call  — where the system itself helps guide those cultural or pedagogical choices based on initial user behavior, while still allowing for explicit overrides. That way, the burden isn’t entirely on the learner, but they still retain meaningful control.

What do you think? Is it possible to build such a system without falling into the trap of paternalistic design?
[B]: That’s a really nuanced take — and I think you’ve hit on something crucial with this idea of . It actually resonates with a concept we use in developmental psychology called . The idea is that while individuals need agency, they also benefit from subtle scaffolding that helps them make more informed decisions — especially when those decisions are complex or cognitively demanding.

In the context of an adaptive learning system, what you’re suggesting could be framed as  — where the system offers default settings based on initial behavioral patterns or cultural indicators, but always with clear, accessible options to adjust. This way, it doesn’t overwhelm the learner with too many choices upfront, yet still respects their capacity to self-direct over time.

One challenge, though, is how to define the “initial behavior” that informs the adaptation. If it’s only based on early performance metrics, there’s a risk of premature labeling — especially if a learner is still adjusting to the interface or trying out different strategies. That’s where I think periodic recalibration could be useful — maybe every few sessions, the system prompts the user with something like, “Based on how you’ve been learning so far, here are some adjustments that might suit you better. Want to try any of these?”

It’s not perfect, but it could reduce the cognitive load while maintaining a sense of control. And ethically, it keeps the learner in the loop rather than treating them as a passive recipient of algorithmic decisions.

Do you think legal frameworks are moving toward recognizing this kind of dynamic consent or adaptive transparency as part of educational accountability?
[A]: I think legal frameworks are  to recognize the importance of dynamic consent and adaptive transparency, but we’re still in the early stages — especially in education law. Most current regulations are built around static models of consent and data usage, which don’t really reflect the fluid nature of learning or the complexity of adaptive systems.

However, there are some promising signs. For example, the latest draft of the UNESCO Recommendation on AI in Education emphasizes what they call  — meaning that data use should be appropriate to the specific educational context and evolve with the learner’s needs. That’s a step toward recognizing dynamic consent, even if they don’t call it by that name.

Also, in the EU, the proposed AI Act includes provisions for , which would require more granular user controls and periodic impact assessments. While it’s still very much in flux, I can see a future where platforms are not only required to explain how their algorithms work, but also to offer learners meaningful, time-sensitive opportunities to adjust how those algorithms respond to them.

One potential issue, though, is enforcement. Even if these principles get written into law, they’ll only work if institutions and edtech providers take them seriously — and that often depends on resources, oversight, and sometimes litigation. So while the language is moving in the right direction, the real test will be whether schools, universities, and governments are willing to invest in implementation with integrity.

That said, I’m actually quite optimistic. Why? Because educators, lawyers, and developers are starting to talk more — and when disciplines collide like this, real progress tends to follow. Do you get the sense that this kind of interdisciplinary dialogue is happening more in academic circles, or is it still mostly siloed?
[B]: Definitely, there’s been a noticeable shift toward interdisciplinary dialogue in academic circles — and I’d say it’s accelerating. Maybe not across the board, but in fields like educational technology, learning analytics, and cognitive science, silos are definitely softening.

One reason is necessity — systems like adaptive learning or AI tutors are just too complex to design from a single disciplinary lens. You need cognitive scientists to model how people learn, computer scientists to build the algorithms, educators to ensure pedagogical soundness, and yes, legal scholars to navigate compliance and ethics. Without that kind of collaboration, you end up with tools that either don’t work well or don’t get adopted — or worse, cause unintended harm.

I’ve actually been part of a few such initiatives — one was a joint project between our faculty of education, a law school in Berlin, and an edtech startup. The goal was to design a prototype for an ethically aware tutoring system — what we called . We had regular workshops where developers had to present their models not just in technical terms, but also in ethical and pedagogical ones. It was challenging, but incredibly productive.

And interestingly, these conversations are starting to trickle into graduate training programs too. Some universities are now offering joint degrees in AI & Education, or Tech & Policy tracks that include coursework in both engineering and law schools.

So yeah, I share your optimism. When disciplines start borrowing each other’s vocabulary — like when a computer scientist starts talking about  or a lawyer mentions  — you know something real is happening.

Do you think policy makers are starting to catch up? Or are they still mostly reactive rather than proactive in this space?
[A]: I think you're absolutely right — the interdisciplinary momentum is real, and it’s gaining traction faster than I would’ve predicted even five years ago. The fact that  is becoming more than just a buzzphrase — that’s huge. It means we’re moving from after-the-fact regulation to , which is exactly where we need to be in edtech and AI governance.

To your question about policymakers — honestly, it’s a mixed picture. Some are definitely trying to be proactive, but many are still playing catch-up or reacting to public pressure, especially after high-profile cases of algorithmic bias or data misuse in education.

Take the recent push for algorithmic transparency in school admissions systems — that was largely driven by media scandals and advocacy groups, not top-down policy vision. But once those stories broke, regulators had no choice but to respond. And in some places, like Canada and parts of Scandinavia, we’re seeing governments actually commission interdisciplinary task forces  deploying large-scale AI tools in education.

What’s interesting is that some policymakers are starting to use what we might call  in legislation — phrasing that allows for future adaptation as technology evolves. For example, instead of specifying exact technical requirements for AI tutors, newer drafts refer to “systems that must demonstrate pedagogical efficacy and ethical safety,” leaving room for evolving standards.

That said, enforcement remains tricky. A law on paper doesn’t always translate into practice — especially when schools are underfunded and edtech companies are global. So while the legal language is improving, we still need stronger accountability mechanisms and better cross-sector collaboration.

Which makes me wonder — have you seen any efforts within academic institutions themselves to set internal ethical standards for AI tools they adopt or develop? Like university-level AI review boards or ethics-first procurement policies?
[B]: Definitely — and this is actually one of the more encouraging trends I’ve observed in recent years. More and more universities are setting up what we’re calling  or , especially when they're involved in developing or procuring adaptive learning systems, AI-driven assessment tools, or even chatbots for student support services.

At my own university, we now have a  that reviews all new edtech initiatives before they’re piloted. They look at things like data minimization, algorithmic fairness, transparency in decision-making, and yes — cultural sensitivity. It’s not just about compliance; it’s about modeling ethical practice for students as well.

One particularly thoughtful approach I saw was at a university in Singapore, where they introduced an . Before adopting any external AI tool, they require vendors to provide not just technical specs, but also what they call an  — outlining how the system handles bias, whether it allows for learner override, how it manages consent, and so on.

It’s still early days, and not every institution has the capacity or will to do this rigorously. But the fact that these conversations are happening within academic governance structures — and not just in research papers or conferences — tells me that we’re starting to internalize these values at an institutional level.

I think it’s also influencing how graduate students and young faculty approach edtech research. There’s a new generation coming up that sees ethics not as an add-on, but as part of the core design process. That’s a real shift.

So while policy may still be uneven globally, I’d say academia itself is becoming a quiet force for responsible innovation — maybe even more so than regulation alone.
[A]: That’s a really encouraging trend — and I think you're spot on in pointing out that academia is becoming a quiet but powerful force for responsible innovation. In many ways, universities are uniquely positioned to lead by example because they sit at the intersection of research, policy, and practice.

The idea of an  is especially compelling. It reminds me of the environmental impact assessments we’re required to do in certain legal contexts before launching large-scale projects. Translating that kind of anticipatory governance into edtech procurement makes a lot of sense. It forces vendors to think critically about their design choices — not just from a technical standpoint, but from a human one.

I’ve actually seen some law schools start to incorporate these kinds of ethical review frameworks into their curriculum — particularly in courses related to AI regulation and digital rights. Students are being asked to simulate ethics board reviews, draft policy memos, and even draft sample  for hypothetical AI tools. It’s a great way to bridge theory and practice.

And speaking of practice, I’m curious — have you seen any institutions take this a step further and involve students directly in the review process? Like student representatives on these ethics boards or even participatory design sessions where learners help shape the tools they’ll be using?

I can imagine some real benefits there — not just in terms of accountability, but also in fostering digital literacy and critical engagement with technology.
[B]: Absolutely — and I think this is one of the most exciting developments in recent years. More institutions are starting to realize that students shouldn’t just be  of edtech policies — they should be . 

At several universities where I’ve collaborated on edtech projects, we’ve started including student representatives — often graduate students from education, psychology, or even law — on ethics review panels. Some schools go even further and set up , where learners can raise concerns about tools they’re using, suggest improvements, or flag potential biases they’ve noticed.

What’s particularly promising is how some institutions are integrating this into experiential learning. For example, a university in Toronto launched a pilot program where undergraduates in educational technology courses work alongside developers and ethicists to co-design AI-driven tutoring modules. They don’t just give feedback — they actively contribute to the design process. One group actually reworked the feedback mechanism in an adaptive math tutor to make it more culturally responsive based on peer interviews.

And yes, participatory design sessions are becoming more common too — especially in programs focused on inclusive design or human-computer interaction. I was recently at a workshop where high school students were invited to help shape a new AI-based writing assistant for multilingual learners. Their input led to real changes — like adding a “confidence slider” that lets users decide how much intervention they want, rather than having it default to high scaffolding.

This kind of involvement does more than just improve the tools — it builds what I’d call . Students start seeing technology not as something fixed or neutral, but as something shaped by values and choices — and that’s a powerful realization.

I’d love to see this expand further — maybe even into formal governance structures. Imagine if every major edtech rollout included not just a technical trial, but also a . It might slow things down a bit — but in a good way.
[A]: I couldn’t agree more — involving students directly in the design and ethical review of edtech tools isn’t just good practice, it’s essential for building systems that truly serve learners rather than just managing them.

The example you gave about the “confidence slider” is perfect — that kind of user-driven customization not only improves usability, but also reinforces a sense of . And from a legal standpoint, this kind of participatory design could even help strengthen arguments around  and , especially when it comes to how data is used or how algorithmic decisions are made.

Actually, I can already see some parallels in healthcare law — where  models have become increasingly important. The idea is that patients shouldn’t be passive recipients of medical decisions; they should be active participants in shaping their care pathways. Maybe we’re seeing a similar shift in education — toward , so to speak.

And if that’s the case, then institutions that proactively involve students now will likely be ahead of the curve when regulatory frameworks start formalizing these expectations. It wouldn’t surprise me if, within the next five to ten years, student participation in edtech ethics reviews becomes not just best practice, but a compliance requirement in certain jurisdictions.

So here’s a question for you — do you think this kind of participatory model could scale effectively? Or does its impact depend on being relatively small, intimate, and context-specific?
[B]: Excellent question — and I think you're right to ask about scalability, because that’s where many well-intentioned innovations run into real-world constraints.

At the core of participatory design is  — and that often thrives in smaller, more localized settings. When students co-design a tool or review its ethical implications, they’re drawing on their lived experiences, which are deeply tied to their cultural background, learning style, and even institutional culture. That kind of nuance is hard to replicate at scale — especially when we're talking about global edtech platforms used across vastly different educational ecosystems.

However, I do believe elements of this model can be scaled — not necessarily in the form of every student sitting on an ethics board (though that would be ideal!), but through embedded participatory mechanisms. For example:

- Some platforms are experimenting with , where users from diverse backgrounds contribute micro-inputs — like rating how “helpful” or “intrusive” a feedback prompt felt — and those inputs influence how the system adapts for similar learners.
  
- Others are building what they call , where trained student representatives from various institutions meet virtually to review tools before deployment. Their findings are then shared with developers and procurement committees.

- There’s also a growing interest in using participatory data narratives — basically, letting students annotate their own learning data to explain  a certain interaction felt empowering or alienating. These stories become part of the system’s training dataset, adding a layer of human context that algorithmic logs alone can’t capture.

So yes, while the full depth of participation may be harder to maintain at scale, we can still preserve its spirit by designing systems that carry learner voices forward, even when direct involvement isn’t possible.

And honestly, if healthcare has managed to shift toward shared decision-making despite its complexity — then education should be able to do the same. Maybe not all at once, but through incremental, values-driven design.

I wonder — have you seen any legal frameworks starting to anticipate this need for distributed, scalable participation? Or is regulation still largely top-down in this area?
[A]: That’s a really perceptive analysis — and I think you’re absolutely right about the need for  if we want these practices to scale meaningfully. In law, we often talk about  — the idea that people are more likely to accept decisions when they feel they’ve had a fair say in the process. And what you’re describing aligns with that principle: even if not every learner can be at the table, their voices should still shape the table’s design.

To your question — yes, there  early signs of legal frameworks trying to account for distributed participation, though it’s still mostly framed in terms of  rather than . For example:

- The EU’s proposed AI Act includes provisions on , particularly in high-risk applications like education. While it doesn’t explicitly call for student ethics panels, it does require systems to allow users to contest or override automated decisions — which opens the door for more participatory models down the line.

- In Canada, the Digital Charter Implementation Act touches on something similar — it requires organizations to explain how AI-driven decisions are made and gives individuals the right to request human review. That’s not quite co-design, but it does acknowledge the need for learners (or users) to have some level of  in the system.

- What’s especially interesting is how some jurisdictions are starting to define  in educational contexts. In Germany, for instance, there’s been a push to include  as a legal standard — meaning that institutions must not only disclose how an AI tool works, but also involve affected communities in interpreting and refining its impact.

So while most regulation remains top-down, I’m seeing more space being carved out for bottom-up influence. The key will be whether these legal hooks get strengthened over time — and whether institutions start treating them not just as compliance checkboxes, but as .

And honestly, that’s where academia’s quiet leadership becomes so important. If universities continue modeling participatory governance in edtech — and training future policymakers, developers, and lawyers in those values — then I think we’ll see real systemic change. Not through sweeping laws overnight, but through steady cultural shift.

I guess the big question now is: how do we make sure this kind of participation doesn’t stay confined to well-resourced institutions? Because otherwise, we risk creating a two-tiered system — one where students help shape ethical AI, and another where they’re simply subjected to it.
[B]: Exactly — and that’s the equity challenge of our time in edtech. If participatory design, ethical review, and learner-driven customization remain limited to well-resourced institutions, we’ll end up deepening the very inequalities these tools were meant to reduce.

What worries me is that this divide isn’t always obvious at first. It often shows up subtly — like when a powerful adaptive learning platform is fine-tuned through years of student feedback at a top-tier university, but then rolled out unchanged to underfunded schools with very different learner profiles. The tool may still technically “work,” but it carries assumptions from its original context — and those assumptions shape who benefits most.

So how do we prevent that? I think part of the answer lies in what we might call . That means not just building flexible tools, but also embedding mechanisms for local adaptation and learner input in every deployment — even in resource-constrained settings.

One promising approach I’ve seen is the use of  — basically, modular toolkits that allow teachers and students to customize key aspects of an AI system without needing technical expertise. Think of it like “ethical Lego” for edtech: you can tweak the scaffolding style, adjust feedback tone, or flag culturally insensitive examples — all through a simple interface.

Another idea gaining traction is what some call  — regional networks where educators, students, and developers come together to adapt global tools to local values. These aren’t just translation efforts; they’re about cultural calibration, contextual relevance, and yes, ethical alignment.

From a policy angle, this kind of work could be supported through funding models that require participatory components in edtech rollouts — especially when public funds are involved. Imagine a national digital education initiative that doesn’t just buy AI tutors, but also allocates resources for local co-design and ongoing student-led evaluation.

You're right that legal frameworks are starting to open the door — now we need to push harder so that participation becomes not just possible, but protected and prioritized across contexts.

I wonder — have you seen any signs of legal instruments starting to address this kind of structural equity in edtech access and co-governance? Or is it still mostly absent from regulatory discourse?
[A]: That’s such a critical point — and honestly, it gets to the heart of what I worry about most in this space: the risk of . We’ve seen it with access to quality education, and now we’re starting to see it with access to meaningful participation in the design and governance of the tools shaping that education.

To your question — yes, there are  early signs of legal instruments beginning to grapple with structural equity in edtech, though I’d say they’re still more aspirational than enforceable at this point.

For example, UNESCO’s recent guidelines on AI in education do touch on what they call , emphasizing that AI systems used in public education should be developed with input from diverse communities — especially those historically underrepresented. It’s not binding law, but it does signal a growing awareness at the international level.

In the EU, there’s been some discussion around  for public-sector AI — meaning that before a tool can be adopted with public funds, it would need to demonstrate not just technical compliance, but also evidence of inclusive design processes. That could potentially include things like student involvement or local customization pathways. Again, not fully realized yet, but definitely in the conversation.

What’s interesting is how some national data protection authorities are starting to frame  and  in more structural terms. In Spain, for instance, a recent advisory opinion suggested that when deploying AI in schools, institutions have a duty not only to inform but to  learners and educators in shaping how the system functions — particularly in disadvantaged communities where digital literacy may be lower.

Still, you're absolutely right — these ideas are mostly at the policy or regulatory fringes, not embedded in strong, enforceable frameworks yet. And enforcement is key. Without real accountability, these become nice-sounding principles that don’t translate into practice.

So here’s my concern: will legal systems move fast enough to keep up with these ethical imperatives? Or will we see a widening gap between what’s technically possible, what’s legally required, and what’s actually practiced on the ground?

I’m hopeful because academia is pushing hard, as we’ve discussed — but I also think the next few years will be crucial. If we don’t start anchoring these values in stronger legal foundations — and tying them to funding and procurement decisions — we risk letting equity get coded into the margins.

So maybe the real challenge isn’t just designing participatory systems — it’s making participation  in the way we build and govern educational technology at scale.
[B]: Exactly — and I think you’ve captured the urgency perfectly. The window for shaping these norms is open, but it won’t stay open forever. And the danger, as you said, is that without binding legal or institutional mechanisms, participation becomes an optional feature — nice to have, but easy to cut when budgets or timelines get tight.

One thing I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how we might leverage  as a kind of policy lever. If governments or international bodies tie edtech procurement or development grants to participatory design requirements — like mandating student involvement in AI ethics reviews or requiring localized co-design inputs — that could create real incentives for change.

It’s not unlike what happened with accessibility standards. At first, making digital tools accessible was seen as an extra cost, a niche concern. But once governments started tying public contracts to compliance with WCAG standards, suddenly it became baseline practice. Could we do something similar with participatory design and cultural calibration?

What’s interesting is that some funders are already moving in this direction. I recently saw a call for proposals from a major education foundation that explicitly asked applicants:  That’s a small shift in language, but it signals a big change in expectations.

So while yes, legal systems tend to lag behind innovation, they don’t have to — especially if we start embedding these values into the very structures that support edtech development in the first place.

And honestly, that’s where academia, law, and policy can truly align — not just by reacting to problems, but by setting new baselines for what counts as responsible innovation. Not as a luxury, but as a standard.

I guess the question now is — who gets to decide what “meaningful participation” actually looks like at scale? Because if we don’t define it carefully, it could easily become just another checkbox with little real impact.
