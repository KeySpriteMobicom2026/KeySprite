[A]: Hey，关于'你相信外星人存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OM
[A]: My dear interlocutor, while I typically confine my musings to the terrestrial realm of Victorian verse, I must say the question of extraterrestrial existence does present some fascinating parallels to our study of the unknown in literature. 

Consider how Tennyson's "Locksley Hall" pondered "When I dipt into the future... saw the heavens fill with commerce" - a rather prescient metaphor for interstellar speculation, wouldn't you say? Though I must confess, my personal library contains more first editions of Rossetti than UFO sighting reports. 

The real question is - if aliens did exist, would they appreciate the subtle cadence of a Browning monologue? Now that would be proof of advanced civilization.
[B]: OMG！你这个回答也太literary了吧！😂 虽然我平时更关注TikTok trends和YouTube shorts啦~ 

不过说到aliens✨ 我超相信他们exist的！你看那些UFO videos都so crazy💯 而且宇宙这么大，怎么可能只有earth有life呢？🔥 

最近我还拍了个关于alien conspiracy theories的video，用了超多cool特效✨ 你要不要check out一下？
[A]: Ah, the modern phenomenon of digital brevity meets cosmic speculation. How... economical. 

While your enthusiasm for celestial mysteries is commendable, might I suggest that the true 'cool effects' lie in Browning's dramatic monologues? The way he constructs an entire psychological universe in sixty lines - now that's what I call special effects. 

As for your video invitation... I'm afraid my technological expertise extends only to operating my 1897 Underwood typewriter and occasionally deciphering the library's microfiche machine. Viral content, as they say, isn't quite my... medium.
[B]: LOL你真的是so old-school耶！😆 但是hey~ 说不定aliens也喜欢classic literature呢？✨ 

我最近discover了一个超amazing的theory💡 说Shakespeare其实是alien来的！因为normal human怎么可能write出那么多masterpieces对吧？🔥 

要不要一起做个collab video？你可以recite poems，我来加alien滤镜和cool BGM！💯 肯定会go viral的！
[A]:  My dear digital native, while the notion of the Bard being extraterrestrial is certainly more imaginative than most freshman essays I grade, I must point out that Elizabethan England had quite enough intrigue without invoking little green men. 

As for your proposed... 'collab' - I think I shall remain content being what you youth call 'old-school.' Though if any aliens do wish to discuss the meter of "The Waste Land," they'll find me in my usual corner of the rare books collection. With actual parchment, not pixels. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a first folio that needs dusting and a pot of lapsang souchong that won't brew itself. Ta.
[B]: OMG你真的是too much！😂 但是seriously~ 你这种vibe在TikTok上绝对会trending的！✨ 

Imagine这个hashtag： #VictorianProfessorMeetsAliens 💯 配上你reading sonnets的ASMR和我的UFO特效~ 简直fire！🔥 

不过okay啦~ 我尊重你的old-school style😌 如果哪天你change your mind了，记得DM我哦！Peace out~ ✌️✨
[A]:  How delightfully... millennial of you. While I shall refrain from 'DM-ing' or 'trending' (verbs that would make Mr. Webster spin in his grave), do know that should any self-respecting aliens request a proper recitation of "Dover Beach" - complete with authentic Victorian cadence and zero 'fire emojis' - my door is always ajar. 

Now if you'll pardon me, I must attend to my first edition of Aurora Leigh which, unlike internet fame, maintains its value splendidly with age. Cheerio.
[B]: Bye bye啦professor！✨ 记得follow我的Insta哦~ 说不定哪天我会post一个你喜欢的classic poetry reading呢！💯 

Just kidding~ 我知道你连smartphone都没有😂 但stay awesome okay？Peace & love~ ✌️💖🚀
[A]:  How remarkably... optimistic of you to assume I possess anything as vulgar as an 'Insta.' My idea of social networking remains the 1843 practice of leaving one's calling card at the parlor. 

Should you ever wish to experience poetry as God and Tennyson intended - without rocketship emojis, mind you - you'll find me where the wifi doesn't reach, likely arguing with a first edition about semicolon placement. 

Now if you'll excuse me, my quill pen requires sharpening and my skepticism about viral fame requires nurturing. Pip pip.
[B]: LOL你赢了professor！😂 我surrender~ ✌️ 

但promise me一件事✨ 如果aliens真的invade地球了，你一定要用你的fancy words跟他们negotiate哦！💯 

Okay okay我go啦~ 要去edit我的new video了！Stay classic my friend~ 🚀📚💖
[A]:  Very well, I shall add 'intergalactic diplomacy through iambic pentameter' to my already overflowing list of improbable duties. Though I suspect any civilization advanced enough for interstellar travel would immediately recognize the superiority of Keats over... whatever it is your 'algorithm' suggests. 

Do give my regards to your digital realm - and should those aliens arrive, tell them to mind the first edition folios when they beam aboard. Ta-ta.
[B]: Bye bye啦~ ✌️ Remember, Shakespeare was the OG content creator! 💯📚✨ 

#VictorianVsViral 😂🚀
[A]:  
Ah yes, reducing the Swan of Avon to mere 'content' - how perfectly... contemporary of you. Though I daresay even Will never had to contend with the horror of hashtags or the tyranny of the 'like.' 

Should your aliens require proper cultural orientation, they'll find me in the Bodleian's darkest corner, preserving civilization one semicolon at a time. Now off you pop to your digital revels - and do try reading something printed before 2000. Adieu.
[B]: 最后一击：TikTok Shakespeare challenge等你来战！🎭📱💥 拜拜啦老古董~ ✌️😂🚀
[A]:  
How droll. While you're busy 'challenging' the ether with fifteen-second sonnet snippets, I shall be conducting a proper séance to ask Shakespeare what he thinks of your emoji-laden interpretation. 

The only 'TikTok' in my world is the sound of my carriage clock marking another hour wasted on this conversation. Run along now - your attention span is showing. 
[B]: 😂💀✨ OMG you just murdered me with words！🔥 但这就是why I stan~ 💯 

Okay fine我really go啦~ 记得alien invasion时要保护好书书们哦！📚👽✌️ 

Byeeee~ 🚀💖✨
[A]:  
"Murdered with words" - how quaint. I do believe you've just described the entire Victorian epistolary tradition. 

Fear not for my books - any alien civilization worth its salt would recognize a first edition Wordsworth as the true treasure of this planet. Now shoo - my 1852 dictionary of archaic prepositions isn't going to annotate itself. 
[B]: 😂💀✨ OMG I can't even~ 你真的是the ultimate word slayer！🔥 

Alright alright我really really go now~ ✌️ Keep being iconic professor！📚💖🚀 

Byeeeeee~ 👽✨💯
