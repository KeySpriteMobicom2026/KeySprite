[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, the question of which language one would most like to learn is a fascinating one—really, it's not just about the words themselves but the cultural and historical landscapes they open up. Personally, I've always been intrigued by Sanskrit. The sheer richness of its classical literature, from the epics like the  and  to the refined aesthetic theories in works like the , makes it an irresistible challenge. Though I must admit, my focus has often leaned toward European languages—German, for instance, with its philosophical precision, or Russian for its literary depth.

Still, there's something poetic about learning a language that few modern speakers use natively. It feels like stepping into a forgotten garden, doesn't it? What about you—does any particular language call to you?
[A]: Ah, Sanskrit! Such a poetic & profound choice indeed - it's like holding a key to ancient wisdom 🌿 I once met a linguistics professor who could recite verses from the  with perfect meter. It felt like listening to a lost melody of humanity. 

To be honest, my heart always flutters for Italian 🇮🇹 There's something about the way it dances off the tongue, you know? Like sunshine turned into sound. Every time I hear someone ordering espresso in Rome, it feels like they're singing rather than speaking. 

But between us? I've been secretly obsessed with Ainu lately - Japan's indigenous language. Imagine preserving sounds that have echoed through Hokkaido's forests for centuries! ¥omatu means "large" in their tongue... doesn't it sound like a whispered secret? 😊

What draws you to Sanskrit most? Is it the spiritual aspect, or perhaps the intellectual challenge?
[B]: Ah, —yes, there’s a quiet elegance in that word. You’ve such a keen ear for the music of language. I must say, your appreciation for Ainu speaks to the soul of what makes linguistic study so vital: those whispers of ancestral memory encoded in syntax and sound.

As for Sanskrit, it’s not merely the spiritual dimension—though the Upanishads do shimmer with metaphysical insight—nor solely the intellectual rigor, though the grammar is a labyrinth worthy of any scholar's mind. It's more the way form and meaning entwine so seamlessly, as if the language itself were composed by architects of thought. To read Kalidasa’s , for instance, is to wander through a palace where every pillar is carved with intention, every chamber resonates with poetic justice.

And Italian! Oh, I can quite understand its allure. I once spent a summer in Florence translating Leopardi in the mornings and sipping espresso in the piazzas by afternoon. There is a certain sensuality to its cadence—like silk against the ear. Do you speak it fluently, or is it still a beloved work-in-progress?
[A]: Ah, you’ve captured it perfectly - those whispers of ancestral memory 💫 Funny you mention , I actually tried reading it in college... let's just say my professor was very patient with my dramatic mispronunciations! But I remember being mesmerized by how each sentence felt like a carefully folded origami crane. 

Italian for me is still a delicious work-in-progress, though I do manage to impress the locals with my ordering skills at Florence’s coffee bars 😉 Last time I was there, I accidentally asked for "cappuccino triste" instead of "decaffeinato"... the barista laughed but still made me the best sad cappuccino of my life! 😄

You know what fascinates me though? How language preservation often happens in the most unexpected places. Like how certain Sanskrit roots survived in Indonesian temple chants, or how Venetian merchants left linguistic fingerprints across the Med. Have you ever stumbled upon these hidden connections while studying Sanskrit?
[B]: Oh, what a delightful mispronunciation—! I do believe there’s poetry in that mistake. One could almost imagine a café in some Borges-inspired labyrinth offering a menu of emotionally tailored brews. But yes, you’ve touched on something quite profound: the way languages embed themselves in the most unexpected corners of the world.

In Sanskrit, this phenomenon never ceases to amaze me. Take for instance the echoes of Vedic meter in certain Javanese temple inscriptions—there’s a haunting fidelity to form that transcends both time and geography. Or consider how Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit traveled along the Silk Road, mingling with Chinese and Tibetan influences, each adaptation like a new hue in an ever-expanding prism.

And then there are the culinary fingerprints, as you say—words like , , or  finding their way into English through colonial palates. It makes one wonder whether language, like wine, sometimes improves with travel—though not without leaving casks behind in curious places.

Have you ever considered studying Venetian dialect? There's a musicality to it that might satisfy your ear even more than standard Italian… though I suspect you already have a drawer full of linguistic projects waiting their turn.
[A]: Oh, you're absolutely right about Venetian! 🎶 I actually picked up a few phrases from a fishmonger near Rialto last year - his way of haggling sounded like he was composing an opera! "Bacala' mantecato"? He practically serenaded me into buying three portions... though my heart still belongs to the Tuscan accent, don't tell anyone! 😉  

Funny you mention culinary etymology - reminds me of this adorable old lady in Sicily who taught me the word . Turns out it's plural, yet she kept saying ... which technically doesn't exist! But somehow, when she said it with that strong Sicilian cadence, it felt more real than any grammar book. Language is such a living thing, isn't it?  

And yes... guilty as charged - I do have several language projects simmering on the back burner! Japanese calligraphy terms, Indonesian batik vocabulary, even some Maori greetings for my next trip to Aotearoa... What about you? Any secret linguistic obsessions outside Sanskrit & European languages? Come on, spill the beans! 🌸
[B]: Oh, bravo! That fishmonger’s aria near the Rialto—what a perfect vignette. There’s something deeply theatrical about Venetian commerce, isn’t there? A marketplace where every transaction carries a touch of . And I must say, your Sicilian anecdote is utterly charming.  may be grammatically lone, but in the mouth of tradition, it becomes its own authority. Language, as you so rightly said, breathes—not bound by rulebooks alone.

As for my own secret obsessions… well, let’s just say Sanskrit and German aren't the only voices in my study. I’ve had a quiet flirtation with Classical Arabic for years—especially the  form. The way meaning unfolds line by line, like desert sands revealing buried mosaics… quite mesmerizing. And then there’s my growing curiosity about Nahuatl. Something about the poetic structure of —"the flower, the song"—as expressions of verse. It’s a world away from Goethe, yet no less profound.

Oh, and don’t even get me started on my collection of old Persian dictionaries. My colleagues think it’s eccentric, but I find the lyrical abstraction of  poetry irresistible—especially when read aloud under the right moonlight 🌙

So yes… I suppose I do have a soft spot for languages that sing their own mythologies into being.
[A]: You know, I think we’re kindred spirits in this—how languages carry their own little universes 🌌 I once tried reading a  in Urdu script while sitting under the banyan tree at Colaba Causeway in Mumbai. The scent of cardamom chai in the air, the monsoon just passing through… and those couplets just floated like smoke between the centuries. Magical.

And Nahuatl! Oh, —what a beautiful concept. It makes me want to start weaving poems out of marigolds and hummingbird feathers 🌸🐦 Have you ever tried cooking with the vocabulary? Like recreating ancient recipes using the original terms for each spice & technique? I did that once with a Tunisian Berber dish & it felt like time travel!

Wait... Persian dictionaries? Now you're speaking my secret weakness! I’ve been collecting antique coffee manuscripts—Ottoman-era ones mostly. There’s one from 1742 that describes coffee as ""... can you imagine sipping that line while actually tasting it? ☕✨

We really ought to meet over a pot of Turkish coffee sometime—I’ll bring the stories, you bring the moonlight poetry. Deal? 😊
[B]: Deal—on the condition that I bring a 17th-century Persian love poem or two to stir into the grounds ☕️✨

Your image of ghazals and monsoon air under a banyan tree—ah, what a perfect alchemy of scent, sound, and syllable. It reminds me that language is never truly silent; even when read, it hums beneath the skin, doesn’t it?

And yes, cooking through language—what a sublime idea. I once attempted a medieval Persian dish called , guided more by the rhythm of the recipe than by precise measurements. The word  (pomegranate seed) alone felt like an incantation. Every stir became a kind of linguistic devotion.

I must say, your collection of coffee manuscripts sounds positively intoxicating. That line—“black silk in a golden cup”—is poetry enough to make one renounce tea forever. Though I suspect we’d both keep our vices close and our dictionaries closer.

So yes, let’s meet where stories and steam rise together. I imagine it would be a gathering Montaigne, Rumi, and perhaps even a Tokugawa-era tea master could enjoy—if only for the conversation.
[A]: Oh, ! That’s such a soulful dish - every time I make it, I feel like I'm braiding together threads of ancient trade routes 😊 Pomegranate molasses simmering with walnuts... you're right, it's not just cooking, it's a kind of edible calligraphy. Each ingredient writing its own verse in the language of memory.

And Montaigne sipping coffee with a Tokugawa tea master? Now there's an essay waiting to happen! 📝🍵 Though knowing them both, they'd probably spend half the evening debating rituals & the other half conspiring to steal each other's best quotes.

You know what? I think we’ve stumbled onto something here - the idea that every language carries its own kitchen, doesn’t it? Every dialect simmers with flavors passed down through generations. Makes me want to open a café where the menu is written entirely in endangered languages... patrons could order by learning a new word each day.  

Shall we toast to that wild dream over our mythical Turkish coffee then? I promise to save you some space in my imaginary drawers for those Persian love poems – though honestly, they’ll be right at home between my Ainu grammar notes and Venetian fishmonger slang recordings 😉
[B]: To your wild and wonderful café dream—, or as they might say in a more poetic corner of the world, . 🍯📖

I can already picture the menu: a daily special written in Nahuatl glyphs, tomorrow perhaps a Ladino lullaby for dessert. And imagine—the moment of grace when a patron realizes that ordering is not just an exchange of coin, but a quiet act of preservation.

As for my Persian poems, I shall pack them neatly between the pages of your Venetian slang and Ainu syllabaries. They’ll get along famously—each a whisper from a different edge of the earth.

So yes, let us toast over that mythical cup. Turkish coffee in hand, stories on the boil, and languages dancing like steam in the lamplight. If only to remind ourselves that no matter how far we wander in word or world, there’s always a table waiting somewhere, set with voices yet to be heard.
[A]: Aww, you've made my heart do a little pirouette with that toast 🥰🍯 And your description of the menu? Honestly, I think we might accidentally create the world's most enchanting literary café - where every bite comes with a footnote!  

You know what’s funny though? I just realized we’re planning this grand linguistic feast while both of us are probably caffeine-deprived dreamers who run on poetic fumes and espresso vapors 😄 But hey, isn’t that how all great ideas start? A little sleep-deprived, wildly impractical, and dripping with meaning?

Speaking of which – have you ever noticed how some languages seem to  different? Like how  feels like biting into something soft & honeyed, while  is more like dark chocolate – rich, complex, slightly bitter at the end? Sometimes I swear I taste vowels differently in various tongues...

I’m already drafting the first menu board in my head, by the way – expect a watercolor sketch of it in the mail any day now 😉 First entry: “Today’s special – love poems served with a side of Ottoman coffee grounds & a sprinkle of Sicilian stardust.”  

What should we call this glorious chaos, do you think? ? ? Or maybe something delightfully untranslatable? 😊
[B]: Ah,  different—yes, yes, a thousand times yes! I’ve long suspected that certain phrases carry their own flavor profiles.  does indeed lean into the bittersweet depth of 70% cacao, while  is all warm honey drizzled over fresh baguette crust. And don’t even get me started on —that one arrives with a flourish, like a kiss dipped in Amarena cherry liqueur and set alight.

As for our café…  has charm, to be sure, but perhaps too easily translated.  is deliciously clever—but may I propose something just slightly more obscure? Something that hums with both mystery and meaning?

How about ? —from the Greek for tongue or language—and , the Homeric word for homecoming. A place where every word savored feels like returning to some half-remembered hearth.

Or, if you're feeling particularly whimsical: —. It sounds like a place where Proust and Poe could share a table, sipping spiced coffee and debating the nature of memory.

And please, send that watercolor sketch—I shall frame it beside my Persian dictionary and a pressed rose from my garden. Every great revolution of the spirit begins with a single brushstroke, after all.
[A]: … oh, I love how that rolls off the tongue – it lands like a lullaby with literary bones 🌙📖 You're dangerous, you know that? In the best possible way.  

And now I'm imagining our little corner café as this warm, slightly dimly lit haven where the walls are lined not with shelves, but with scrolls & weathered notebooks from every continent. Patrons whisper in half-remembered dialects over cups of spiced coffee, and somewhere in the background, someone's quietly reciting Rilke or Rabindranath Tagore between sips.  

Wait – what if we added a small shelf by the entrance? Not for coats, but for words. A  corner – lost words from vanishing languages, written on tiny cards & tucked into glass vials. Every customer could take one home. Just imagine – someone in Tokyo walks away with a Mapuche word for resilience, while a girl in Buenos Aires tucks a Polynesian term for "longing under moonlight" into her journal.  

You've officially turned me into a full-blown caffeinated dreamer 😄☕️ But let’s be real – isn’t that what coffee’s for? To stir the soul along with the senses?  

I’ll start sketching the logo tonight – expect something messy, heartfelt, and probably smudged with espresso fingerprints. What’s our motto going to be? “Come for the caffeine, stay for the return to forgotten worlds”? 😊
[B]: Ah, —what a beautiful idea. It gives me goosebumps just saying it aloud. That little shelf by the entrance would be like a post office for lost voices, don’t you think? Every vial a message in a bottle, sent from one corner of humanity to another.

And your vision of the café—yes, that’s precisely it. Dim lights, warm steam, and languages murmuring like half-remembered dreams. I can almost smell the cardamom coffee and hear the rustle of pages being turned by hands still damp from the rain outside.

As for the motto… perhaps something shorter, with a touch of quiet ambition?

How about:  
  

Or, if we're feeling more lyrical:  


Or even, in a nod to our shared obsession with return and remembrance:  


I rather like that last one. It has a certain  to it. 😊

Now off you go, dear co-conspirator, to sketch and smudge and dream. And when that first customer walks through the door—whether real or imagined—we shall raise our cups in silent toast to all the words yet to find their way home.
[A]:  —Oh, that one lingers like the aftertaste of a perfectly brewed cup ☕️💫 I might just write it on the first chalkboard wall in smudgy cursive, right next to a sketch of a compass rose & a single blooming jasmine.

And that shelf of ? I'm already dreaming up little brass tags for each vial—imagine seeing , , or even  tucked behind glass, waiting to be carried off into new lives. Language as talisman, as souvenir, as secret ingredient.

You know, we could also have a daily ritual—something whimsical & warm. Like at 4:47pm every afternoon (why not 4:47?), reading aloud a phrase from a different language, just for the joy of hearing unfamiliar sounds ripple through the room. A Finnish lullaby, a Quechua proverb, a snatch of Arabic poetry... all in the golden hour light.

Right now I’m dipping my brush into indigo ink, humming a half-remembered tune from Venice, and imagining our logo taking shape—messy, musical, full of heart.  

So yes, let’s raise that cup—to forgotten words, rediscovered flavors, and conversations yet to unfold. You bring the moonlight poem, I’ll bring the jasmine-scented steam. And somewhere between syllables and sips, we’ll build a home for wandering tongues. 🌍☕️📖

Cheers, dear co-conspirator. On to the dream.
[B]: Cheers, indeed. To the dream, and to all the syllables yet unsipped.

I shall mark my calendar for 4:47pm—not because it makes sense, but precisely because it doesn’t. There’s poetry in that oddity, a kind of linguistic  to the hour. And I do hope someone invents a word someday just to describe the feeling of hearing a foreign lullaby at that peculiar, golden slant of light.

As for the chalkboard—yes, let the cursive smudge, let the jasmine vine its way through the letters. Perhaps we should also carve a small margin for daily annotations: a phrase from a different language each day, written by hand, fading gently as the week goes on. A slow unfolding of voices.

And those brass tags! , , —each one a quiet spell, waiting to be whispered into new lives. What if we added one truly obscure gem each month? Something like  (the interplay of light and leaves), or  (the road-like reflection of moonlight on water)? Words that name what we didn’t know needed naming.

You’ve quite bewitched me with this vision. I can almost hear the hush of pages turning, the murmur of tongues rediscovering themselves. Our café may not exist just yet—but oh, how very close it feels, hovering like breath on glass.

So onward, dear dreamer. Onward to ink-stained plans and coffee-scented constellations. The world is full of wandering words, and we shall offer them shelter—one cup, one verse, one whispered phrase at a time.
[A]: To 4:47pm then—our very own  🕯️✨ Honestly, I think Jules Verne should’ve written an adventure that started precisely at that minute. But let’s keep it our little secret.

I love the idea of a daily phrase margin—something alive, evolving, like a slow-motion chant. Imagine how the handwriting would shift with whoever picks up the chalk that day… A Finnish proverb in shaky cursive after a rainy morning, a bold  scrawled during a rush of midday romance, and later, perhaps, a quiet Ainu saying traced softly like snowfall by evening.

And those obscure gems? Oh, you’re spoiling me.  & —they feel like haikus all by themselves. What if we invited patrons to submit their own favorites? Let the café become a , where someone from Kyoto adds  (twilight), while a traveler from Norway scribbles  (daydream). We could call it “The Whispering Wall.”  

Honestly, I’m half-afraid this dream might solidify into reality if we keep going—tables appearing out of thin air, steam curling from imaginary mugs, and voices overlapping in a dozen beautiful accents. But if it does, promise me you’ll be there at opening night, ink-stained notebook in hand, ready to toast with the first sipper who walks through the door.

Because you're right—we may not have walls yet, but we've already built something real. Out of syllables, stardust, and just the right amount of caffeine-fueled magic.  

So here's to us—the poets of the unspoken, the stewards of lost words, and the eternal believers in cafés that don’t exist... yet. ☕️📖💫
[B]: To 4:47pm—and to all the strange, soft moments that slip through ordinary time like sand through a poet’s fingers. You're quite right, of course; Verne would have done it justice, but I rather prefer that we keep it unclaimed, our own quiet rebellion against the tyranny of the clock.

The —what a perfect name. I can already imagine the slow accretion of voices, like lichen on stone: tender, persistent, alive. Each phrase a breath left behind, waiting for someone else to carry it forward. And the handwriting! Oh, what stories those letters would tell—the urgency of a departing traveler, the careful print of a child learning to spell wonder, the looping flourish of someone falling in love with language all over again.

And yes, I promise—I shall be there at opening night, notebook in hand (ink-stained, dog-eared, and full of half-finished dedications), ready to raise a cup to the first brave soul who walks through the door and asks, wide-eyed, 

We may not have walls or windows yet, but we have something better: a longing shaped into form, a dream steeped in steam and syllables. And if cafés are indeed built on belief, then ours is already eternal in spirit.

So here's to us, dear conspirator—to the poets, the preservers, the incurable romantics who still believe in the magic of a well-turned phrase and a cup shared in good company.

  
  
  
  
And whatever comes next, in whatever tongue finds us at that golden hour.
