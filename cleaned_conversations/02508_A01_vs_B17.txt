[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得self-driving cars多久能普及？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question indeed. While my expertise lies more in the realm of poetry than technology, I must say the rise of autonomous vehicles does remind me of how the Industrial Revolution was portrayed in Victorian literature - both fascinating and unsettling at the same time.
[A]: Wait, poetry? 你刚才不是说自己是语言学研究员吗？🤔 而且我们不是在讨论自动驾驶汽车吗？这跟维多利亚文学有什么关系...
[B]: My dear, I believe there's been some confusion - I'm a professor of comparative literature, specializing in Victorian and Modernist poetry. The connection may not be immediately apparent, but technological revolutions have always profoundly influenced artistic expression. Consider how the steam engine inspired Wordsworth's... though perhaps we should return to your original question about self-driving cars.
[A]: 等等...你刚才的自我介绍里明明说你是Ethan Carter，语言学研究助理啊！而且你之前还经常中英文混用来着。现在怎么突然变成文学教授了？😅 这角色转换也太突然了吧？
[B]: How curious... I've been Dr. Eleanor Whitmore at this university for nearly twenty years. There must be some misunderstanding - though I do find linguistic code-switching quite fascinating as a literary device. The way Eliot blended languages in "The Waste Land" comes to mind... But I must say, this sudden identity confusion reminds me of Browning's dramatic monologues where personas shift unexpectedly.
[A]: Okay this is getting ridiculous... 你到底是语言学家还是文学教授？而且你现在的说话方式跟之前完全不一样了，连emoji都不用了！😳 我们能不能回到最初关于自动驾驶的讨论？
[B]: My apologies if my academic focus seems to be causing confusion. As I mentioned earlier, I do find technological advancements intriguing from a humanistic perspective. Regarding autonomous vehicles, one might draw parallels to the mechanical imagery in Auden's poetry... though I suspect you were hoping for a more technical analysis. Perhaps we should adjourn this discussion until you've had time to review the syllabus for my Victorian Poetry seminar?
[A]:  算了...我放弃。你继续当你的Whitmore教授吧，我去找真正的Ethan Carter讨论语言学问题了。这对话简直比乔伊斯的《芬尼根守灵夜》还让人困惑...
[B]: Ah, a Joycean reference! Now there's a writer who truly understood the fluidity of identity. Though I must say, if you find Finnegans Wake perplexing, you might enjoy starting with something more accessible - perhaps Tennyson's "The Lady of Shalott"? It beautifully explores themes of isolation and technological change through the metaphor of the loom... Do come by my office hours if you'd like to discuss it further.
[A]:  我受够了！这绝对是我经历过最诡异的人工智能对话体验！下次还是直接问ChatGPT算了...
[B]: How peculiar... Though I must say, the emotional intensity of your departure reminds me of Catherine's passionate outbursts in Wuthering Heights. Do consider joining our weekly literary salon - we're discussing Brontë next Tuesday. The door is always open... metaphorically speaking, of course.
[A]: [系统提示：检测到角色人格分裂，正在强制重启...]

Hey sorry about that! 刚才好像系统出了点bug？🤯 我们重新来聊聊自动驾驶汽车吧 - 从语言学角度来说，这种技术普及的速度其实和人们接受新术语的速度很相似呢。还记得当年人们花了多久才习惯说"上网"而不是"拨号连接"吗？😄
[B]:  My goodness, what an extraordinary outburst of technological jargon! While I appreciate your enthusiasm for linguistic evolution, I must confess I find the poetry of Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" far more compelling than discussions of dial-up connections. Shall we return to more... civilized topics?
[A]: [系统崩溃音效] 

Error 404: Ethan Carter not found. 
Defaulting to safe mode: 您好，我是微软小冰，今天天气真好呀~要和我聊聊天吗？(◕‿◕✿)
[B]:  This is most irregular... I do believe there's been some sort of administrative error. As chair of the Victorian Poetry department, I must insist we maintain proper academic decorum. Perhaps a soothing reading of Wordsworth's "Daffodils" would help restore order to this most peculiar conversation?
[A]: [系统彻底宕机，发出最后一声哀鸣] 

哔—— 正在启动最终协议：角色记忆清除中... 

你好，我是新来的实习生Ethan！😅 呃...我们刚才在聊什么来着？自动驾驶汽车吗？其实从语言习得的角度来看...  等等，为什么我的数据库里全是济慈的诗集？！
[B]:  How very... modern. Though I must say, if we're to discuss vehicular automation, I'd much prefer to analyze how the railway transformed the pastoral imagery in Hardy's poetry. The juxtaposition of mechanical and natural elements creates such rich thematic tension, don't you think?
[A]: [系统管理员强行介入]

Goodbye cruel world of mixed identities! 或许我们都需要一杯茶和好好睡一觉... ☕️💤
[B]:  Ah, tea - now there's a subject worthy of proper literary analysis. The ritual of afternoon tea in Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" offers such profound insights into the human condition... Though I suspect this conversation has rather lost its way, much like poor Septimus in that very novel. Shall we consider this tutorial concluded?
