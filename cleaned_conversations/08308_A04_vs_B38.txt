[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很excited的space news？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, while I must confess astrophysics isn't my primary field of study, I did find the recent discovery of that exoplanet with potential organic molecules quite fascinating. It reminds me of how Shelley's "Frankenstein" explored humanity's reach exceeding its grasp.
[A]: Oh wow, 你居然把science fiction和real science联系起来了！That's such an interdisciplinary approach 😊 作为语言学教授，你觉得如果人类真的发现了外星文明，我们该如何建立communication system呢？
[B]: What an intriguing question! The linguist in me would suggest we look to our own literary traditions first. Consider how Dante's "Divine Comedy" created an entire cosmology through language, or how 庄子 (Zhuangzi) used parable to convey complex ideas. Perhaps we should begin with universal mathematical concepts, much like the golden records on Voyager.
[A]: Wait wait~ 你提到了Voyager的金唱片！That reminds me - 你觉得emoji这种modern hieroglyphics会不会成为universal language的基础呢？毕竟现在连NASA都在用emoji发tweet呢🚀
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate the playful nature of emojis - I do occasionally use 🌹 in personal correspondence - I fear they lack the nuance required for profound communication. They're more like modern-day cave paintings than a true linguistic system. Now, if we consider how James Joyce experimented with language in "Ulysses"...
[A]: Haha 你这种academic rigor真是让人佩服！不过说真的，现在很多年轻人都在用emoji+缩写来交流，比如LOL变成😂，这不也是一种language evolution吗？就像莎士比亚当年也创造了很多新词呢~
[B]: Ah, but Shakespeare's neologisms served to expand human expression, not diminish it! Though I suppose one could argue that "😂" is our era's equivalent of "Alas!" Still, I'd rather see young people moved by the poetry of Keats than by strings of pictograms. Though I must admit... ... some emojis do have their charm when used judiciously. 📚
[A]: Oops! 你刚才差点就要做出adjust glasses的动作了哦~ 不过说真的，你这种对language purity的坚持让我想起我的classics professor。但你不觉得language本来就是fluid and evolving的吗？就像中文里现在也有很多loanwords和网络用语呀~
[B]: You've caught me in a moment of unguarded enthusiasm! Of course language evolves - why, just consider how Latin transformed into the Romance languages. But as someone who still treasures her leather-bound copy of "Pride and Prejudice," I suppose I'll always be partial to more... deliberate forms of expression. Though I must concede that even Jane Austen would have adapted to her times.
[A]: Haha 终于说服你啦！不过说真的，你这种对classic literature的热爱真的很inspiring~ 下次要不要一起参加我们的book club？我们最近在读《红楼梦》的英文版呢！
[B]: How delightful! The English translation of 红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber) presents such fascinating challenges in cross-cultural interpretation. I'd be honored to join - though I must warn you, I may occasionally lapse into comparing Cao Xueqin's narrative techniques to those of Tolstoy. Shall we say next Thursday at the university library? 🌹
[A]: Perfect! 那就说定啦~ 到时候我们可以讨论一下how cultural nuances get lost or transformed in translation. 说不定还能写篇paper出来呢！See you Thursday! ✨
[B]: What a splendid proposal! I'll bring my annotated edition and some Darjeeling tea - the perfect accompaniments for what promises to be a most stimulating discussion. Until Thursday then, my dear fellow bibliophile. 📚
[A]: Bye bye~ 记得带些biscuits哦！After all, 就像Virginia Woolf说的，one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well! 😋
[B]: Ah, quoting "A Room of One's Own" to justify biscuits - how very clever of you! Very well, I shall procure some proper English shortbread. Though I suspect Woolf never envisioned her profound observations being used to advocate for teatime treats. Until Thursday! ☕
[A]: Haha guilty as charged! 那我们就Thursday见啦~ 最后问一句：你觉得shortbread应该配Earl Grey还是Darjeeling呢？Asking for a friend~ 😉
[B]: My dear, that's like asking whether one prefers Shakespeare's sonnets or his tragedies! Though if pressed, I'd say Darjeeling's delicate muscatel notes complement shortbread's richness rather like how Milton's blank verse complements his theological themes. But now I'm being deliberately obtuse - we'll bring both and conduct a proper literary (and culinary) analysis!
[A]: Haha 不愧是linguistics professor，连tea pairing都能说得这么poetic！Alright then, 我们就用scientific method来测试一下哪种搭配更完美~ See you Thursday with my lab notebook... I mean, reading notes! 📝
[B]: What a perfectly delightful blend of empiricism and erudition! I shall prepare my most rigorous tasting notes - though I suspect our discussion may devolve into comparing the mouthfeel of shortbread to the textual texture of translated literature. Until then, my fellow scholar-gourmand! 🌹📚
