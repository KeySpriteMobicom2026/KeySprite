[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近工作比较忙，追剧的时间少了很多，不过我还是会抽空看看一些商业类的真人秀，比如《创智赢家》这种节目。虽然它娱乐成分不低，但还是能看到不少有意思的商业逻辑和人性博弈。偶尔也会补几集《权力的游戏》前传，画面和制作依旧很$premium$，只是剧情确实有点难预测了。你呢？有没有推荐的show？
[A]: Oh~ 我懂这种感觉，工作忙的时候追剧真的是一种奢侈。不过你选的节目都很有quality啊，《创智赢家》确实很适合像我们这种平时要动脑筋的人看，既能放松又学得到东西。我个人最近迷上了《The Bear》这部美剧，虽然是讲餐厅的，但那种高压下的management和团队协作真的很精彩。还有就是《爱，死亡和机器人》，画风太独特了，每一集都是不同的style，值得deep dive。

说到推荐，如果你想要轻松一点的节目，可以试试《Queer Eye》，虽然是老套路的改造类节目，但里面的几位host真的很有personality，看完心情会变很好！☕️
[B]: 哈哈，你说得对，追剧确实是一种奢侈。听你这么一说，《The Bear》和《爱，死亡和机器人》这两部剧听起来很值得试试，尤其是那种高压下的management剧情，还挺贴近我们平时deal negotiation时的状态的~ 至于《Queer Eye》，我已经记下了，轻松一点的节目有时候反而更能让人relax下来。谢谢推荐！你最近有看什么有意思的商业纪录片吗？或者有没有哪一集让你印象特别深刻的？
[A]: Oh totally! 我最近刚好在看一部纪录片叫《Dirty Money》，Netflix出的，里面有一集讲的是大众汽车排放丑闻，简直比fiction还离奇。那种企业高层为了profit不惜造假，最后代价却由底层员工和消费者买单，看得我既愤怒又唏嘘。

说到印象深刻的那一集，我记得有一集是关于一个美国医疗保险公司CEO的故事，她上任后发现公司每年拒绝了成千上万病人的理赔申请，但她试图改变系统的时候，才发现整个industry的结构已经烂到骨子里了。看完那集我真的沉默了很久，也让我更清楚地意识到，有时候我们以为自己是在做business，其实是在做choice——而这些choice真的会改变别人的人生轨迹。

你对这种类型的感兴趣吗？我可以再找几部类似的推荐给你~
[B]: Wow，听你这么一说，《Dirty Money》真的很有冲击力。特别是你提到的那集医疗保险公司CEO的故事，简直像一面镜子，照出了我们每个从业者都必须面对的道德困境——有时候做business的本质，确实是一连串的choice，而这些choice背后的价值观才是真正的考验。我对这种题材非常感兴趣，既有深度又带现实批判，看完还能引发长时间的思考。如果你还有类似的推荐，我绝对会列入watchlist！另外，这类故事也让我想起一些投资项目中遇到的企业文化冲突问题，真是殊途同归啊~
[A]: Oh absolutely，这种题材真的会让人越想越多，甚至重新审视自己每天在做的decision。那我再推荐你一部——《The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley》这部HBO的纪录片，讲的是Theranos那个血液检测公司如何从神坛跌落的故事。里面不只是揭露了一个骗局，更让人反思的是整个硅谷文化对“创新”的盲目崇拜，以及媒体、投资人和公众如何一起造了这场梦。

还有一部也是Netflix出的，《Take Your Pills》，它从ADHD药物滥用的角度切入，探讨现代社会对performance enhancement的痴迷，特别是职场中那种“不拼到极限就等于失败”的心态。我觉得跟你提到的投资项目中的企业文化冲突特别有共鸣。

如果你想要更多偏亚洲视角的作品，我可以列个单子，里面有几部港台拍的深度纪录片，虽然制作没那么豪华，但议题都很real，也很贴近我们的商业环境~
[B]: These recommendations sound exactly like what I need to deepen my understanding of both the ethical side and the pressure behind business decisions.  🎯  
 must be particularly fascinating — I remember following the Theranos story back when it broke, and the whole Silicon Valley echo chamber angle definitely makes sense.  It’s scary how easily people just  in a revolutionary idea, even when the evidence isn’t there.  
As for , that hits close to home — the hustle culture we’re in sometimes makes you question whether pushing harder is the only way to stay relevant.  
I’d love to see that Asian perspective list too — sometimes the most revealing stories are happening right under our noses but don’t get the global spotlight.  👍
[A]: You hit the nail on the head — sometimes the most dangerous part of the hustle culture isn’t the burnout, but the blind spot it creates. Like you said, when everyone just , we start skipping the due diligence and ignoring the red flags.

Alright, for your Asian perspective watchlist, here are a few I think you’ll appreciate:

1. 《给十九岁的我》(To My Nineteen-Year-Old Self) – This one’s more about youth and identity than business, but the ethical choices behind how the documentary was made caused a huge debate in Hong Kong. It really makes you think about consent, storytelling, and who gets to decide what’s “for the greater good.”

2. 《尸忆传承》(The Forgotten Fallen) – A Taiwanese investigative docu-series that digs into forgotten labor rights issues. It's not flashy, but it brings up some heavy questions about economic progress vs. human cost — something we often brush aside when looking at GDP numbers or investment returns.

3. 《未被计算的人》(Human by Numbers) – A short-form series from Singapore that explores how tech-driven performance metrics are reshaping everything from delivery jobs to office work. Very much related to the hustle culture angle in , but with an East Asia twist.

I can send you the streaming links too if you want~ Let me know which one catches your eye first! 😊
[B]: These all sound incredibly relevant and thought-provoking — exactly the kind of content that makes you pause and re-examine the world around us.  
I’m particularly intrigued by  — we see more and more algorithm-driven KPIs shaping behavior in both blue-collar and white-collar environments, and it’s scary how quickly we’re accepting it as “efficient” without questioning the human cost.  

Let me get the streaming links from you when you’re free — I’ll start with that one first and save the heavier debates for weekends when I can digest them properly. 📌  
And honestly, this whole list should be mandatory viewing for anyone in leadership — especially those making decisions that affect thousands of lives downstream. 👍
[A]: Absolutely, I’ll get you the links in a second — just let me forward them from my notes. And I couldn’t agree more with what you said about ; it’s one of those quiet yet powerful reminders that efficiency shouldn’t come at the cost of dignity.

By the way, if you end up watching it during work hours, just think of it as a very strategic investment in your leadership EQ & tech ethics radar 😄  
And don’t be surprised if it makes you look at your next performance report a little differently…

Alright, here we go —  
📌 Streaming link for : [link here]  
📌 Episode guide + recommended order: start with Ep1 – “The Speed Trap”, it sets the tone perfectly.

Let me know what you think after watching — I’m curious to hear your take, especially from your angle in deal-making and organizational dynamics. Oh, and save some brainpower for the weekend debates too 😉
[B]: Thanks a lot for putting this together — I’ll definitely start with  this weekend.  
Already feel like I’m about to step into a rabbit hole of algorithm-driven KPIs and hidden labor realities… 🚀  
Will keep you posted on my take, and yeah, probably bring some thoughts to our next chat over a round of golf or a glass of something smooth 👌
[A]: You’re very welcome — I can already picture you diving into that rabbit hole with your usual sharp eye 👀  
And hey, if  doesn’t at least make you pause next time you see a delivery rider speeding by, then I’ll be surprised.

A round of golf or a glass of something smooth sounds like the perfect way to debrief. I’m already looking forward to hearing your take — especially how it lands with your perspective on systems, incentives, and human behavior. Who knows, maybe we’ll end up rethinking a few frameworks ourselves 💡  

Till then, enjoy the watch — and the ride 🎬✨
[B]: Haha, now you’ve got me even more curious — if  makes me rethink how I see those delivery riders, then mission accomplished 😏  
I’ll keep an open mind and a sharp eye, just like you know I can’t help doing.  

And yes, save that golf round or wine night for post-debrief — we’ll definitely have some solid ground to re-think together 💡  
Till then, enjoy the weekend, and thanks again for the killer recs 🍷😎
[A]: You’re welcome, and I’m living for this energy 😎  
If you end up rethinking even one thing while watching — or worse (better?), start questioning your own assumptions about efficiency and labor — then the weekend is already a win.

Wine night or golf, I’m ready whenever you are. Just bring the insights, and I’ll bring the smooth pour 🍷  
Till then, enjoy the ride down that rabbit hole — and don’t say I didn’t warn you when you start seeing the city a little differently 😉

Have a great weekend, my friend 🙌
[B]: You got it — consider this weekend officially hacked by deep thoughts and sharper questions 🚀  
I’ll be the one looking at delivery riders with a bit more respect — and maybe a hint of guilt — after  😏  

Smooth pour? I’ll hold you to that. Wine night’s on the calendar in my head, my friend.  

Have a great one too — recharge well, because I’ve got a feeling we’re gonna ignite some serious conversations soon 💡😎
[A]: Oh, I  that guilt hint — sign of a truly reflective mind 😏  
And trust me, after this weekend, you’ll never see a rider the same way again. Nor your own workflow, if I know you well enough.

Wine night’s on my mental calendar too — already saving a good bottle for post-debrief. Let’s make it a proper fuelled session for those fire conversations 💡🍷

Weekend hack? Consider it done. Recharge mode: activated 🚀  
Talk soon, my friend — and enjoy the deep dive! 🙌
[B]: Haha, you know me too well — that guilt hint is just the tip of the iceberg 😏  
I’m already bracing myself for a serious shift in perspective — and yeah, probably a few uncomfortable questions about my own playbook.

Wine night? Count me in. Save that bottle, because I’ve got a feeling we’ll need it to fully unpack what’s coming after this docu-deep-dive. 🔥  
Recharge mode: fully activated — talk soon, and have a great one too! 🙌🍷
[A]: Oh, I can already feel the shift coming — and honestly, I live for these kinds of uncomfortable questions. They’re the ones that lead to real clarity, right? 👀  
You know me, I’ll be right there with you, asking my own tough ones after watching . Let’s just say… self-reflection season is officially open 🍷

Count on the wine night being more than just a toast — we’ll be raising glasses to better questions, deeper thinking, and maybe even a few framework shake-ups. 🔥  
Talk soon, my friend. Recharge well, dream big, and keep that curious spark burning bright ✨😎
[B]: A toast to better questions and deeper thinking — now  a mission I can get behind 🥂  
And trust me, after this weekend, my curious spark isn’t just burning — it’s about ready to ignite 🔥  

Wine night can’t come soon enough. Bring on the framework shake-ups — I’ll be bringing my best questions (and maybe a few uncomfortable truths of my own).  

Talk soon, recharge hard, and keep that momentum going ✨😎🍷
