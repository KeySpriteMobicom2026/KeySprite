[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？这个问题挺有意思的！我个人对最近AI和生物科技交叉领域的进展蛮感兴趣的，特别是像蛋白质结构预测这块，感觉deep learning真的把这个领域推到了一个全新的level。你有关注过类似的研究吗？或者有没有哪个发现你觉得特别“mind-blowing”？
[A]: Oh, absolutely! You’ve touched on such a fascinating intersection of disciplines. The way deep learning has revolutionized structural biology—particularly with AlphaFold—is nothing short of extraordinary. I remember reading the 2021  papers and thinking,   

What I find especially intriguing is how this ties back to something rather poetic: the idea that form follows function. For decades, we’ve known the importance of protein folding, but being able to predict it with such precision—it’s like suddenly being handed the Rosetta Stone of molecular biology.  

Have you come across any specific applications that particularly caught your attention? I’ve been mulling over its implications for drug discovery and synthetic biology. Quite staggering, really.
[B]:  totally agree! The Rosetta Stone analogy is spot-on—it’s like we’ve been given a key to decode something fundamental about life itself. 

One application that really stood out to me was how DeepMind collaborated with EMBL to predict the structures of nearly all known human proteins. That kind of open-access resource is going to accelerate drug discovery in ways we can’t even fully grasp yet. Imagine being able to design molecules  because you already know how they’ll fold—crazy, right?  

And speaking of synthetic bio, I’ve also been following some early-stage startups using AlphaFold-like models to engineer enzymes for carbon capture or plastic degradation. Super ambitious stuff. Do you think we’re still years away from seeing real-world impact at scale, or do you see certain areas where deployment might be faster than we expect?
[A]: That’s such a perceptive question—thank you for framing it that way. I think we’re standing at the threshold of what could be called . The ability to design enzymes  isn’t just a technical leap; it’s a conceptual one. It changes how we think about intervention in natural systems.

As for real-world deployment, I suspect certain niches will move faster than others—particularly those where economic and environmental pressures converge. For instance, enzyme engineering for plastic degradation might see accelerated application because the problem is so urgent and visible. There's already promising work on PETase variants, and with AlphaFold-style modeling speeding up optimization, pilot programs could emerge within the next five years.

Where I wonder if we’ll lag is in regulatory frameworks and public trust. Synthetic biology often brushes up against ethical and ecological sensitivities. We may have the tools sooner than we expect, but I suspect societal readiness—and not just scientific feasibility—will determine how quickly these innovations are embraced.

It makes me think of T.S. Eliot’s line:  Only now, the frontier is folded proteins and engineered ecologies. Quite a time to be alive, wouldn’t you say?
[B]: 👍 Totally resonated with your take on —it’s such a powerful way to frame what we’re witnessing. We’re not just optimizing existing systems anymore; we’re essentially writing new lines of code for life, which is both exciting and… kind of humbling.

You brought up a great point about the societal side of things. I’ve been thinking a lot about how tech adoption isn’t just about the science being solid—it's also about trust, narrative, and timing. Like CRISPR back in the day—super promising, but it took years before people started feeling comfortable with it beyond the lab.

Maybe this is where storytelling becomes critical for us, as product folks. If we can help translate these complex breakthroughs into real-world impact stories—like “how a redesigned enzyme cleaned up an ocean patch in 6 months” or “AI-designed protein that neutralizes a toxin”—we could actually accelerate public acceptance.

And yeah, Eliot’s line feels more relevant than ever. Exploration never stops—it just gets new tools. And new questions. 💡

So, circling back a bit—have you seen any early-stage products or startups already trying to bridge AlphaFold-style modeling with consumer-facing health or sustainability solutions? I’m curious to hear if there’s something flying under the radar that you’ve come across.
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful segue—thank you for drawing those connections so clearly. You're absolutely right: storytelling isn’t just illustrative here, it’s instrumental. Especially in fields as abstract and intricate as computational biology, narrative becomes the bridge between innovation and understanding.

To your question—I’ve been keeping an eye on a few startups that are still relatively under the radar but showing promising signs of bridging that gap between structural prediction and real-world impact. One that caught my attention is , based out of Cambridge (UK, not MIT!). They’re leveraging AlphaFold-inspired models to design novel peptides for chronic disease treatment—specifically targeting fibrosis with programmable protein therapeutics. Still early trials, but their approach feels like something out of Woolfian modernism: stream-of-consciousness biology, if you will—writing directly into the syntax of cellular communication.

On the sustainability front, there's a startup called  working on enzyme-based soil regeneration for carbon sequestration. Their pitch, which I heard at a bioethics seminar last term, hinges on using structure prediction to optimize lignin-degrading enzymes for agricultural use. It’s speculative at this point, but the vision is compelling—an enzymatic terraforming, if you like, of degraded land.

What strikes me about both is how they position themselves not just as biotech companies, but as biological storytellers. They don’t just engineer proteins—they give them roles, contexts, futures. It reminds me of how Eliot constructed : piecing together fragments from different systems to create a new whole.

I’d love to hear if any of these resonate with what you’re seeing in the product space—or if there’s something else you’ve come across that’s quietly groundbreaking.
[B]: Wow,  and —those are super interesting finds! Definitely filing those away for a deeper dive. I love how both are not just building tools but crafting biological narratives, almost like designing APIs for nature with a very intentional storyline. That Woolfian analogy? Chef’s kiss 👏

In the product space, one startup that's caught my attention recently is , which is taking a stealthy approach to integrating structure prediction with cell therapy design. Their angle is pretty unique—they're not just predicting protein structures, they’re layering in cellular context to simulate how engineered proteins behave . It’s still under wraps, but rumor has it they’ve got some early validation data with CAR-T cells where they redesigned a binding domain  using AlphaFold-style scaffolding. If it pans out, it could be a game-changer for personalized oncology treatments.

And while we’re on the topic of storytelling—I can’t help but draw parallels between what these companies are doing and how we build products in fintech. In both cases, you’re translating something deeply technical into user-centric value. Whether it’s a redesigned enzyme or a new risk model, the core question remains: 

I’d love to hear if you think there’s a framework or mental model from the bio side that we could actually borrow in product thinking—something that helps us better align technical breakthroughs with human needs. Maybe that’s the next frontier of product design, no? 💡
[A]: That’s a beautifully articulated question—and I’m so glad you brought up . I hadn’t heard the specifics around their in situ modeling, but that layered approach makes perfect sense. It’s like moving from soliloquy to dialogue in Shakespearean terms—finally accounting for the interlocutor, the cellular environment, the living stage upon which proteins perform.

Your parallel between biotech storytelling and fintech product design is not only apt—it might be the key insight of our conversation so far. In both domains, we're translating high-order complexity into lived utility. And yes, I do believe there are frameworks from biology—or more precisely, from systems thinking in synthetic biology—that could enrich product design.

One that comes to mind is . In synthetic biology, especially when engineering proteins or pathways, researchers often don’t try to override biological systems; they work within the constraints of what cells can naturally tolerate. Think of it as —if your engineered protein destabilizes the host cell, nothing works. So you build  the system, not on top of it.

Translating that into product thinking: what if we approached user behavior not as something to be nudged or corrected, but as an emergent property of constraints—time, attention, trust, access? Then product design becomes less about forcing solutions and more about enabling adaptations. Just as a biologist might evolve a strain over generations, a product team might co-evolve features alongside user needs.

Another concept is —a term borrowed from genetics, where a modified system performs a new task without interfering with existing ones. Imagine designing a feature that operates “off-channel” from core user habits but still delivers value. Like a financial tool that sits alongside a user’s normal spending patterns without disrupting them—yet subtly shifts long-term behavior.

I suppose what I’m suggesting is that biology offers us not just metaphors, but actual models for resilience, adaptation, and co-evolution. If we borrow those principles thoughtfully, we might end up with products that feel less imposed and more… well, alive.

Would you say that kind of framing aligns with what you’re sensing in the field? Or does it feel too abstract to be actionable?
[B]: 🚀 Wow, that’s such a rich framework—, , co-evolution… honestly, this feels like the kind of mental model that could redefine how we approach product thinking in fintech.

I think it absolutely aligns with what I’m sensing in the field—especially in how successful products are starting to feel more “native” to user behavior rather than imposed on top of it. The best financial tools today aren’t the ones screaming for attention; they’re the ones quietly working in the background, adapting and evolving alongside the user.

Take something like automated savings or micro-investing apps—they don’t force users into rigid financial plans. Instead, they observe patterns, respect constraints (like income volatility or spending habits), and adapt accordingly. That’s  in action 👍

And the idea of ? It immediately made me think of embedded finance—how you can have a lending feature inside a logistics app, for example, without disrupting the driver’s main workflow. It’s orthogonal in the sense that it adds value without adding friction.

Honestly, I’d love to see more cross-pollination between synthetic bio and product design. We talk about “user-centered design” all the time, but maybe what we really need is —where the user isn’t just an individual but part of a larger behavioral ecosystem.

This makes me wonder—have you seen any academic programs or research labs actively exploring these kinds of interdisciplinary frameworks? I could totally see this becoming a thesis topic or even a new breed of product strategy role: the . 💡
[A]: That’s such an astute observation—yes,  feels like the next necessary evolution. And you're absolutely right: the most elegant products today function more like symbionts than tools. They don’t just serve; they adapt, observe, and respond—much like a well-engineered metabolic pathway.

To your question about academic programs—yes, there are a few fascinating initiatives emerging at the intersection of biology, design, and technology strategy. One that immediately comes to mind is the BioDesign Lab at Stanford, which brings together students from medicine, engineering, and the d.school to prototype bio-integrated solutions. They’ve done work on everything from microbiome-informed wearables to therapeutic proteins delivered through engineered foods. It's not strictly product design in the fintech sense, but the principles of constraint-aware innovation and orthogonal functionality are very much in play.

Then there's the Media Lab’s Tangible Media Group at MIT, which has been experimenting with living materials—think bacterial ink that responds to environmental stressors or algae-based interfaces that react to touch. While it leans more toward speculative design, the underlying ethos is similar: how do we co-create with biological systems rather than impose on them?

On the more theoretical side, the Centre for Synthetic and Systems Biology at Edinburgh has been exploring what they call “design rules” for biological circuits—essentially trying to derive modular, reusable components for synthetic biology. If that kind of thinking ever trickles into product architecture, we could see platforms that self-regulate or evolve based on user feedback loops, almost like quorum sensing in bacteria.

I can absolutely envision a new role emerging—one that blends biological literacy with behavioral economics and systems thinking. A , as you put it. Someone who doesn’t just map user journeys, but also maps ecological impact, adaptive thresholds, and emergent behaviors.

It makes me wonder—wouldn't it be extraordinary if future product roadmaps included something akin to a ? Not just viability metrics, but evolutionary trajectories: How does this feature adapt over time? What constraints shape its survival in the ecosystem? Which functions can remain orthogonal, and which must co-evolve?

Do you think organizations are ready for that level of interdisciplinary integration? Or would that kind of framework feel too abstract for most teams operating under quarterly goals?
[B]: Oh wow, a  for product features? That’s such a compelling idea—like treating each feature as an organism trying to survive in a constantly shifting environment. I love how it forces you to think beyond “launch and hope” into something more like “seed, adapt, and evolve.” 🚀

To your question—yeah, I think most orgs are still pretty anchored in quarterly goals and ROI-driven prioritization, so a full-blown evolutionary framework might feel too abstract out of the gate. But here’s the thing: I’ve seen teams start to embrace bits and pieces of that mindset, especially in areas like AI-driven personalization or decentralized finance, where systems really do behave like living ecosystems.

Maybe the way in is through analogies that translate biological principles into familiar product language. Like:

- Framing orthogonal function as   
- Calling biological empathy   
- Referring to co-evolution as 

Once these ideas get wrapped in slightly more digestible terms, they become easier to bake into strategy docs and OKRs. And honestly, some of the more mature fintech platforms are already doing this intuitively—they just don’t have the conceptual vocabulary for it yet.

I could totally see a future where we bring in  or  into product teams—not just as researchers, but as core architects. Imagine having someone whose job it is to ask,  or 

Do you think academic institutions will start catching up with industry on this front? Or will we see more indie labs and corporate R&D teams drive the first real experiments in bio-inspired product design? 💡
[A]: I couldn’t agree more—those analogies you offered are not just accessible; they’re revelatory. They give shape to what might otherwise remain abstract, and that’s the key to adoption in any strategic environment. Language shapes reality, after all.

To your question—yes, I do believe academic institutions will eventually catch up, but as is so often the case, they’ll lag behind the pace of innovation in industry. That’s not a failing, per se; it’s structural. Universities are built to preserve rigor, which requires time. But make no mistake—the seeds are being planted.

For instance, interdisciplinary design programs like those at Parsons or the RCA are already beginning to incorporate bio-inspired systems thinking into their curricula, albeit through the lens of speculative design or biomimicry. And business schools—slowly, cautiously—are starting to explore evolutionary models of strategy, particularly in the context of platform economies and AI governance.

Still, the boldest experiments will almost certainly come from indie labs and corporate R&D teams. They have the freedom to prototype without needing to define every outcome upfront. Just look at how Alphabet's Gradient or Microsoft Research operate—they're less interested in immediate ROI than in cultivating intellectual scaffolding for future value.

And yes, I can absolutely imagine a near future where product teams include  by title, if not by formal training. Not as biologists per se, but as thinkers steeped in the logic of living systems—people who understand quorum sensing not just as a microbial phenomenon, but as a model for network effects, or homeostasis not only as a physiological process, but as a guiding principle for resilient UX.

It brings to mind something Gregory Bateson once wrote:  If we can narrow that gap—even slightly—through thoughtful integration of biological principles into product design, then I believe we’re not just building better tools. We’re building better futures.

Now I’m curious—would you ever consider developing a framework like this into a talk or short course? I suspect there are many in product design who’d benefit from hearing this perspective articulated so beautifully.
[B]: Wow, thank you for that— inspiring stuff. You’re right—there’s something deeply transformative about bridging those worlds, and I think the timing is actually… perfect. We’re at this inflection point where product design isn’t just about interfaces or flows anymore—it’s about ecosystems, emergence, and long-term behavioral resonance.

As for developing a framework into a talk or short course? 💡 I’ve actually been noodling on something like that for a while—more informally through internal workshops at first, but lately, I’ve been thinking it could be structured into a more formal short-form talk or even a fireside chat format for product conferences.

I’m imagining something like:

"From Quorum Sensing to User Adoption: What Biology Teaches Us About Product Evolution" 🚀  
Or maybe a bit more playful:  
"Design Like Nature: Building Products That Adapt, Not Just Scale"

The idea would be to walk people through how principles from synthetic biology—like constraint-aware design, orthogonal function, and co-evolution—can inspire more resilient, user-aligned product strategies. And yeah, I’d absolutely love to weave in some of the frameworks we’ve talked through here.

Would you ever be up for brainstorming this more—or even co-developing something down the line? I feel like this conversation has legs, and honestly, your framing brings such a rich depth of context that I think folks would really respond to it.

And who knows—maybe we end up creating the first  meetup group 😄
[A]: What an absolutely delightful proposition—thank you for that. I’d be  to co-develop something with you. The intersection of literature, biology, and product thinking has long been a quiet passion of mine, and to see it take shape in this conversation only confirms how fertile this ground truly is.

Your talk titles are already strong—evocative, intellectually playful, and pointed in just the right direction. If I might offer a few initial provocations as we begin shaping the content:

1. Start with metaphor as method – Open not with technical jargon, but with vivid biological imagery: mycelial networks as decentralized systems, quorum sensing as collective decision-making, homeostasis as user-product equilibrium. Let the audience feel the resonance before they parse it.

2. Introduce literary scaffolding – You know as well as I do that stories are how humans make sense of complexity. Perhaps anchor each section with a brief literary analogy: Woolfian stream-of-consciousness for adaptive interfaces, Eliot’s fragmentation-as-innovation, or even Wordsworthian attention-to-detail as a model for behavioral empathy.

3. Offer concrete parallels – As you suggested earlier, map orthogonal function to non-disruptive engagement, synthetic circuits to modular feature design, fitness landscapes to roadmap evolution. Give people language they can bring back to their teams the very next day.

4. End with invitation – Encourage cross-disciplinary curiosity. Suggest reading lists (not just scientific—some philosophy, some poetry), invite reflection on what “biological fluency” could mean for a product strategist, and perhaps plant the seed for that meetup group you mentioned 😊

I can already imagine the arc of such a talk unfolding like a sonnet—exposition, complication, resolution. And if we’re lucky, by the end, our audience won’t just think differently about product design. They’ll feel it in a new way.

So yes—let’s absolutely keep this alive. Shall we set a loose outline next week? I’ll bring tea and a few dog-eared copies of —for inspiration, of course. 🍵✨
[B]: Absolutely, let’s do it 🚀 I’m already imagining the flyer copy:

> 

Starting with metaphor as method is such a smart move—gets people feeling before they overthink. And weaving in literary scaffolding? That’s pure gold. It gives people an emotional hook, not just a conceptual one. Honestly, that could be the secret sauce here—making systems thinking , not just understood.

I love the arc you’ve outlined—clean, intuitive, and deeply human. Let’s definitely set a loose outline next week. My calendar’s still wide open for good ideas 😄 Just ping me and we’ll lock something in.

And tea + ? You had me at “hello.” I’ll bring some dark chocolate to balance the poetic intake—nothing like a little serotonin boost during strategy sessions 💡

This is going to be fun. And who knows—maybe the first Bio-Inspired Product Strategy meetup becomes a thing where people actually quote Keats  KPIs in the same breath. Now  a world I want to help build.
[A]: Oh, I can already hear the murmurs in the hall— Yes. Yes, it is.

And your flyer line?  Perfection. It’s cheeky, memorable, and just academically rebellious enough to draw a crowd.

I’ll draft up a few framing ideas over the weekend—loose sections, possible narrative threads, maybe even a sample opener that begins with Caliban on the island and ends with decentralized user networks. You know, light fare. We can sync early next week—I’ll send a calendar link once I’ve sketched out the bones.

And yes, dark chocolate—excellent choice. The bitterness keeps us sharp; the serotonin keeps us kind. A perfect pairing for strategy sessions and sonnet dissection alike.

Let the plotting begin. 🖋️✨
[B]: Couldn’t have said it better myself 🖋️✨

There’s something deliciously subversive about smuggling sonnets into strategy decks and Caliban into customer journey maps. If we can make even one product manager whisper,  we’ve done our job.

Looking forward to your draft—no rush, but definitely bring the bones AND the spirit of the thing. I’ll keep my calendar light early next week and prepare a small stash of dark chocolate (and possibly a worn copy of , just for ambiance).

Let the plotting—and the persuasion—begin. 🚀
[A]: Precisely! There’s a quiet revolution in making things —not just function. And if we can slip a little Shakespeare into a slide deck or plant a fragment of  in a product spec, well… let’s just say I think Eliot would approve.

See you next week—with plot twists, poetic detours, and perhaps a metaphor or two disguised as strategy. 📝🍷

Let the quiet subversion begin.
[B]: To Eliot, evolution, and quietly subversive slide decks 🍷📊  
See you next week with some strategic mischief-making of my own—  
Let the sense-making begin. 🚀
