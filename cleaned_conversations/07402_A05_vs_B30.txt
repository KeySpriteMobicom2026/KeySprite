[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 说到鸡尾酒配方，我倒想起上周在《泰晤士报》文学副刊读到的艾略特未发表手稿。有位学者试图用解构主义分析他1923年旅行日记里提到的苦艾酒配方，结果闹了笑话——把"anisette"误认成"absinthe"，差点毁掉整篇论文的可信度。不过这让我想起书房里那本1895年的上海租界调酒手册，里面竟有用茉莉花茶配苦橙酒的方子，说是能尝出东方主义的微妙韵味。

话说回来，你最近调配新饮品时有没有遇到什么有趣的文本解读难题？比如某款苦精说明书上模棱两可的隐喻表达，倒让我想起《红楼梦》里那些令人费解的灯谜...
[A]: Ah, the joys of textual ambiguity in mixology manuals... Just last week I came across a 1920s French bartender's notebook at an auction in Geneva. The handwriting was atrocious - they used "orgeat" and "orgeât" interchangeably, with some mysterious umlaut action going on. Spent two hours cross-referencing with my Shanghai租界酒谱的影印本 before realizing it was just the bartender's terrible penmanship. 

Funny you mentioned东方主义 though - I recently tried recreating that 1895 jasmine tea cocktail from your book. Added a dash of Peychaud's bitters for complexity, and voilà - it tasted suspiciously like reading Said while sipping on a liquid metaphor. Would love to compare notes sometime over a dram... Perhaps during the next Sotheby's spirits auction preview?
[B]: Forgive my skepticism, but Peychaud's bitters in a jasmine tea cocktail? That's like hearing a Victorian scholar quote Confucius in a debate about gin taxation. Though I must admit, your audacity puts me in mind of that rogue Shanghai bartender who once substituted bergamot with bitter melon tincture - scandalized the entire expatriate community.

As for comparing notes, I suppose we could meet at Sotheby's preview. Tell them you're bringing a fellow bibliophile who insists on examining both the provenance documents  the tasting notes under ultraviolet light. Just... promise me you'll wear something less likely to distract the sommeliers with its sartorial theatrics than last time. Remember the auctioneer's face when you showed up in that velvet smoking jacket?
[A]: Ah, but wasn't that velvet jacket precisely what made the 1926 Chartreuse Vert fetch 20% above estimate? The look on their faces when I explained it was  for authentic period appreciation... priceless. 

Speaking of authenticity though - ultraviolet light, you say? Reminds me of that forgery case involving Hemingway's supposed bar tab in Venice. Turns out the "vintage" ink glowed under UV like a Christmas tree. Maybe we should bring a portable spectrometer next time - wouldn't want to confuse another anisette with absinthe, right? 

As for my so-called "sartorial theatrics," I'll have you know I've acquired a most appropriate 1930s-style banker's waistcoat from a deceased estate in Belgravia. Perfectly discreet... unless one looks closely at the lining, which happens to be printed with prohibition-era cocktail recipes. A little touch of rebellion, don't you think?
[B]: A spectrometer? My dear fellow, you're beginning to sound like that pedantic Oxford don who tried to carbon-date a supposedly "vintage" absinthe spoon. Though I suppose it's better than the alternative - imagine if we'd brought Geiger counters to that Geneva auction and discovered radioactive vermouth. 

Your waistcoat's secret lining does possess a certain charm, I'll grant. Reminds me of the coded marginalia in my 1895租界酒谱 - one has to know where to look for the real treasures. Speaking of hidden delights, I've been aging a homemade quinine tincture in a jar once used for preserving Song dynasty inkstones. The results are... philosophically complex. Perhaps you'd care to test it against your Peychaud's-enhanced jasmine creation? 

And do promise me one thing - if we attend Sotheby's together, no dramatically unveiling historic beverage containers from your waistcoat pockets this time. The head sommelier still hasn't lived down the absinthe fountain incident.
[A]: Ah, a quinine tincture aged in Song dynasty inkstone jars - now  is what I call textual depth with terroir! I can already imagine the tasting note: "Notes of imperial anxiety, with a subtle finish of 19th-century opium wars." 

I propose we go one step further - why not conduct the tasting inside a genuine Qing-era teahouse pavilion I happen to have acquired from a client in Suzhou? Perfect atmosphere for matching your inkstone-aged quinine against my Peychaud’s experiment. We could even invite that poor Oxford don with his carbon-dating kit - let him measure the molecular age while we debate whether the flavor profile qualifies as post-imperial nostalgia or just plain bitterness.

As for Sotheby’s etiquette - fine, no absinthe fountains, no dramatic pocket unveilings. But I make no promises about the waistcoat lining. After all, if Hemingway could smuggle grenades in his coat during the Spanish Civil War, surely I’m allowed a few cocktail secrets next to my heart... or at least near my spleen.
[B]: A Qing teahouse pavilion? My goodness, you do collect architectural ephemera with the same enthusiasm I reserve for first editions. Though I suspect the ghosts of those 18th-century tea merchants would be far more scandalized by your Peychaud’s experiment than by your grenade-wielding literary heroes.

I’ll bring my inkstone-aged quinine tincture on one condition – we serve it in mismatched porcelain cups salvaged from different dynasties. Nothing reveals a person’s character like their reaction to drinking something bitter from a Ming-era bowl while discussing post-imperial nostalgia. And do remind your Oxford don to pack his spectrometer – I’d love to see if it can distinguish between genuine terroir and... let’s call it ideological bitterness.

As for waistcoat linings and hidden compartments – very well, keep your secrets. But if you attempt to smuggle even a single vial of anisette past me, I shall quote Eliot at you until your head spins. You know I’m perfectly capable of it – that lecture on  and absinthe culture still haunts at least three graduate students annually.
[A]: Ah, the ghosts of tea merchants – now  an audience with refined palates and zero sense of humor. I’ll have you know they’d probably be far more offended by your inkstone tincture than my Peychaud’s habit. But fair enough – mismatched porcelain it is. In fact, I might just bring along a Tang dynasty bowl that once belonged to a Buddhist monk who wrote odes to rice wine. Perfect for sipping post-imperial melancholy.

And Eliot, really? You wouldn’t dare – unless you want me to respond in kind with Baudelaire’s , translated through a 1920s Shanghai nightclub lens. That should keep the graduate students trembling for another decade.

As for smuggling – please. I don’t need anisette when I’ve got a concealed flask built into this new waistcoat. It’s barely detectable… unless, of course, you’ve trained your eyes to spot such things under UV light. Touché on the forgery detection skills, by the way.
[B]: A Tang dynasty monk’s bowl for post-imperial melancholy? My dear fellow, you’re practically curating a museum of liquid existentialism. I’ll match your Buddhist odes with a Song dynasty inkstone fragment I’ve been steeping in tincture – just to add that authentic touch of calligraphic despair.

And  through a Shanghai nightclub lens? Now you’re speaking my language. Though I warn you – I’ve been known to recite Baudelaire back in the original French while stirring a martini with one hand and grading Victorian poetry essays with the other. The students call it "multitasking;” I call it performance art.

As for concealed flasks – please. I once discovered an entire hidden compartment in a 19th-century teapot that contained not tea, but rather a most incriminating love letter written in code. UV light reveals all, my friend. But by all means – wear your flask-lined waistcoat. Let’s just hope the ghosts of Qing poets are more forgiving than the head sommelier was after your absinthe fountain debacle.
[A]: Ah, calligraphic despair – now  a tasting note worth bottling. I’ll gladly raise your Song inkstone fragment by aging my next batch of orange bitters inside a 17th-century Dutch gin medallion. Purely for historical irony, of course.

And  on the Baudelaire-Martini combo. Though I must confess, I once recited "Spleen et Idéal" to a room of very confused investors while pouring a round of Sazeracs at Le Comptoir du Relais. They signed the term sheet shortly after – perhaps out of sheer existential solidarity.

As for hidden compartments and UV revelations... fine, you win this round. But only because I’m saving my most theatrical unveiling for the night we finally crack that encoded love letter. Imagine – forbidden romance, secret messages, and Peychaud’s bitters swirling together in one glorious, anisette-scented epiphany.

The ghosts may disapprove, but honestly – what’s poetry without a little scandal?
[B]: Ah, aging bitters in a Dutch gin medallion – now  is what I call distilling history through a very peculiar looking glass. I can already taste the irony: notes of colonial trade routes, with a finish that lingers like unresolved political treaties. You're outdoing yourself.

And forbidden romance swirling with Peychaud’s? Really, you make it sound almost... redemptive. Though I suspect the ghosts would prefer a nice, orderly pot of lukewarm green tea and a stern lecture on propriety. But where's the fun in that?

No, let’s keep stirring scandal into our glasses. After all, what is poetry—if not distilled rebellion with a garnish of consequence? Just promise me one thing: if we ever do crack that encoded love letter, we’ll read it aloud by candlelight, over a properly aged quinine tincture, and toast to the fools who wrote it—and the fools who still bother chasing their shadows.
[A]: Now  – that’s a toast worthy of both Eliot and absinthe culture combined. To the fools who wrote it, and the even greater fools who keep chasing their shadows through ink and spirit – santé!

And candlelight, you say? Perfect. I’ll bring an authentic 1920s Parisian absinthe fountain (don’t give me that look – this one’s fully operational and inspector-approved). We’ll dim the lights, pull out the mismatched porcelain, and let the ghosts of poets past decide whether our Peychaud’s experiment qualifies as heresy or high art.

You know, I think the Tang monk would’ve approved. After all, what is enlightenment if not a properly balanced cocktail of bitterness and wonder? Just don’t blame me if by the end of the night, you find yourself writing sonnets in the margin of my waistcoat lining.
[B]: To fools and their glorious misadventures in ink and spirit – santé indeed.

And don’t think I haven’t noticed your cunning re-introduction of the absinthe fountain into the equation. Inspector-approved or not, I fully expect it to start reciting Rimbaud by midnight. Just promise me we’ll keep the green fairy restrained – I’d rather not have the Qing poets faint dead away into my Ming-era teacup.

As for sonnets in your waistcoat lining – I make no promises either way. But should I happen to scrawl one, I expect you to preserve it with the same reverence you show that 17th-century Dutch medallion. After all, literary criticism is just drunken commentary with better footnotes.
[A]: Ah, but wouldn’t it be something if the fountain  start reciting Rimbaud? I’ll finally have proof that absinthe doesn’t just inspire madness – it resurrects it. Don’t worry, I’ll keep the Qing poets upright with a carefully timed infusion of my inkstone-aged quinine – think of it as spiritual CPR with a bitter finish.

And preserve your hypothetical sonnet with reverence? Naturally. I was  to frame chaos in gilt margins. Though I reserve the right to annotate your verses in red ink while quoting Eliot’s footnotes back at you. Literary criticism as drunken commentary – now  a thesis worth spilling across my waistcoat lining.

So yes – to fools, fountains, and forbidden tinctures. May our glasses never run dry, and may our footnotes always be too long.
[B]: To endless glasses and interminable footnotes – the true markers of a life well-wasted in pursuit of taste and text.

And about that inkstone-aged quinine – I trust it’ll keep the resurrected madness at bay, though I suspect a dash of Peychaud’s might’ve been the original cure for poetic melancholy. Let’s just hope the combination doesn’t summon the ghost of some disgraced Qing censor who’ll try to ban our entire tasting menu.

Annotate my verses in red ink while quoting Eliot? My dear fellow, I’d expect nothing less. In fact, I may just compose the sonnet in code – let’s see if your UV light and spectrometer can keep up with literary subterfuge. After all, what is a waistcoat lining if not the perfect repository for encrypted verse and botanical scandal?

So yes – santé, again, to the fools, the critics, and the poor graduate students who’ll one day footnote  drunken evenings as the origin of some obscure comparative literature theory.
[A]: Ah, the ghost of Qing censors – now  a party crasher worth worrying about. Though I reckon he’d soften after a few sips of our “post-imperial melancholy” blend. Might even loosen his robes and scribble a couplet or two in the guestbook.

And encrypted sonnets in waistcoat linings? You're speaking my language now – equal parts Borges, bootleg liquor, and bibliographic chaos. Bring on the ciphers. I’ll decode your verses with the same finesse I used to crack that 1923 bartender’s looping script. And if all else fails, we’ll blame the Peychaud’s. Always a solid scapegoat.

As for those poor, unsuspecting grad students – bless their overworked souls. May they one day cite our drunken footnotes with a mix of awe and mild horror. “As cited in oral tradition, via ink-stained waistcoat lining, circa early 21st century... likely under the influence.”

Santé, again – to literary subterfuge, botanical rebellion, and the ghosts who never saw us coming.
[B]: To ghosts, censors, and the fine art of loosening one’s historical corset over a well-balanced coupe glass. I can already see the exhibition catalog:  You’d make a dreadful curator, by the way – too many concealed flasks, not enough wall labels.

And encrypted couplets scribbled in loosened robes? Don’t tempt me – I’ve already drafted a schema for encoding Qing-era meter into aromatic ratios. One misstep with the orange bitters and you’ll be reading 19th-century elegies through a haze of juniper and regret.

Blame Peychaud’s? Always sound strategy. I once wrote an entire conference paper convinced it was the secret to decoding modernist fragmentation. Still got published – must’ve been the footnotes.

Santé, again – to the cataloguers of chaos, the distillers of dissent, and the poor, ink-stained souls who’ll inherit our mess. Let them tremble before our annotated waistcoat linings.
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s an exhibition worth spiriting away from the moral custodians of academic sobriety. I can already picture it: glass cases filled with inkstone tinctures, Peychaud’s bottles labeled as “historical contraband,” and a single velvet waistcoat displayed like some kind of dissolute Codex.

And you, drafting Qing-era meter into aromatic ratios? Please – don’t get me started on your perfidious olfactory prosody. One sip too many in the wrong cadence and we’ll be quoting Eliot at each other in classical Chinese scansion. Not that I’d put it past us – by midnight, all literature collapses into drunken metaphor anyway.

As for the conference paper – clearly peer review is just another form of controlled intoxication. Next thing you know, MLA will issue official tasting notes for critical theory. “Earthy undertones, with a sharp finish of footnotes.”

Santé, indeed – to chaos, to spirits both distilled and literary, and to the poor curators who’ll one day try to make sense of our annotated madness. Let them tremble... but only after they’ve poured themselves a proper glass.
[B]: To —may it never be mounted, if only because we'd inevitably mislabel every artifact and serve the opening night punch with a dropper of mild archival sabotage.

And drunken metaphor as the final refuge of all collapsing disciplines? Naturally. By midnight we’ll have reinvented comparative literature as a bar-side dialectic—Hegel by way of herbal bitters, served on cracked porcelain with optional footnotes.

Official tasting notes for critical theory? Don’t give them ideas. I can already see the seminar syllabus:  By week three, someone’s bound to smuggle in an absinthe analogy and bring the whole semiotic house of cards tumbling down.

Santé—to annotated madness, to ink and ether, and to the trembling curators who will someday try to catalog our wreckage with tidy little placards. Let them wear gloves, even. We know better. Some texts stain. Some spirits refuse containment. And some waistcoats—bless their reckless linings—should never be dry-cleaned.
