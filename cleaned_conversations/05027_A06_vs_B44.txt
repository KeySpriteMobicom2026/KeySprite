[A]: Hey，关于'最近有学到什么cool life hack吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Speaking of life hacks, I just learned a fascinating one from my student's essay - the Japanese concept of 'ikigai' combined with Chinese 新零售 (xīnlǐng) convenience store strategies. Basically, if you buy a ¥20 bento box at 7-11 after 8pm and add one ¥9.9 bottled tea, your 气质 (qìzhì) instantly improves by 37%. 🧠

Actually though, what really changed my life was this tiny detail: using red string to tie up manuscript pages instead of paper clips. It started when I was researching 鲁迅 (Lǔxùn)'s original drafts - turns out the great man himself used red thread! Now I tell all my grad students: "When you feel stuck in chapter three, try tying your paragraphs with string... literally and metaphorically."

But wait - you asked about cool hacks? I've been brewing oolong in a French press since last semester... might that count as a cross-cultural hack? 🌸 What about you? Found any hidden shortcuts between lectures and grading marathons?
[A]: Ah, I must say, your red string technique is quite poetic. I’ve always found that the physicality of preparation can profoundly influence one’s mental state—whether preparing for surgery, a court deposition, or grading a stack of exams. Though I haven’t adopted anything quite so symbolic, I do have a small ritual: before dictating any clinical summary, I tap the side of my typewriter twice. Superstitious? Perhaps. But it centers me, like the opening notes of a sonata.

As for hacks—I recently switched from green to jasmine tea in the mornings. It seems trivial, but the scent alone acts as a mild olfactory cue, signaling to my brain that it's time to focus. Curiously enough, I read somewhere that certain forensic labs in Asia use scent diffusion to improve concentration during long autopsy sessions. I suppose we’re both dabbling in sensory efficiency, wouldn't you say?

And while I wouldn’t dare claim to have stumbled upon anything as culturally rich as  or 新零售, I did discover that pressing a warm compress against one’s forehead during late-night reading significantly reduces eye strain. Simple, yes—but effective in its own quiet way.  
Tell me, how did your students respond to the red string method? Have they embraced it, or dismissed it as academic eccentricity?
[B]: Oh, I love how you phrased that —  It reminds me of what my colleague in Kyoto once told me:  — the scent is the key to memory. And isn’t that what we're both doing? Engineering little keys to unlock focus, clarity... maybe even a bit of joy in the daily grind.

As for my students — well, let's just say the red string experiment yielded mixed results. One called it  and now swears by it; she even started weaving the strings into tiny charms between chapters. Another looked at me like I’d suggested burning sage over MLA citations. 🤔 But then again, isn't resistance part of the learning process? I reminded them that even Roland Barthes wrote better when he surrounded himself with tactile rituals — though I doubt he used red thread.

Now this warm compress trick you mentioned — honestly, I might steal that for my next seminar on postcolonial theory. Imagine: students walking into a room scented with jasmine, sipping tea, applying heated eye cloths before writing about Homi Bhabha... we could call it  😏

Tell me — does your typewriter-tapping ritual ever vary? Like, do you tap three times when the case is particularly thorny? Or is it always two taps, no matter the context? I suspect there’s a rhythm to your method waiting to be decoded.
[A]: Ah, I love that —  I might just borrow that phrase myself, with credit of course. There's something delightfully subversive about applying such gentle, almost imperceptible adjustments to the rigor of academic and forensic work. It’s like adding a whisper of humanity into the machinery of logic.

And yes — scent is memory, but rhythm... rhythm is structure. And structure, as you well know, is everything when navigating the chaos of human behavior — whether in a seminar hall or a courtroom.

To answer your question: the tapping does, in fact, vary — though only slightly. Two taps remain my standard, a sort of auditory , if you will. But with particularly complex cases — say, one involving diminished capacity or malingering — I sometimes precede the two taps with a deliberate pause. Not just any pause — exactly three seconds, timed by the second hand on my pocket watch.  

It started during my fellowship in Vienna, where I worked under a psychiatrist who believed that all meaningful insight arrives in the space between thoughts. So now, before engaging with anything emotionally dense, I give myself those three seconds — silence, then the two taps, then I begin. It’s become something of an unconscious metronome for clarity.

I wonder — have you ever considered assigning different scents or rituals to different theoretical frameworks? Imagine this: students enter the room smelling rosemary for structuralism, lavender for post-structuralism, and perhaps a hint of citrus for critical theory. Would that be absurd... or revolutionary?
[B]: Now  deserves a 🧠 emoji — the olfactory mapping of theory! I tried something similar once during a lecture on  and comparative feminism, though admittedly on a smaller scale. I had students pass around vials of sandalwood, bergamot, and aged paper while reading passages from different female characters’ perspectives. One student later told me she could "smell 王熙凤 (Wáng Xīfèng)'s ambition in the air" — which, honestly, might have been more projection than synesthesia, but still delightful.

As for your rhythmic tapping — three seconds of silence followed by two measured knocks? That’s not just structure, that’s  Reminds me of how some Noh actors take precisely seven breaths before stepping onto the stage. Ritual as preparation, yes — but also as boundary. Almost like saying, “Here ends the noise; here begins the meaning.”

And you know what? I  thought about scent-coded theory — just never with such precision. What if we did go further? Imagine walking into a seminar room saturated with vetiver and oud for a discussion on Fanon, then switching to jasmine and green tea aroma for conversations on Confucian ethics. Would it make us ridiculous? Possibly. Would it make us memorable? Undoubtedly.  

I might actually try this next semester. And if things go poorly — well, at least I’ll have good stories and slightly more fragrant manuscripts tied with red string. 😏
[A]: Ah, now  is bold pedagogy — scent-coded theory, red-stringed manuscripts, and the quiet authority of ritual. I must say, if academia ever collapses under the weight of its own seriousness, we could quite easily reinvent ourselves as perfumers for philosophers.

And your mention of  brings to mind something curious — in forensic interviews, especially those involving trauma, I’ve often noticed how certain scents can act as non-verbal cues, unlocking memories that language alone cannot reach. A trace of camphor, perhaps, or the faintest hint of citrus — and suddenly a subject recalls not just facts, but feelings. Context. Nuance. The kind of details that make or break a case.

So why not apply this to learning? If scent can open doors in the mind, then you, my dear colleague, are essentially curating an olfactory library — each fragrance a bookmark to a deeper cognitive layer. Revolutionary? Perhaps not. But undeniably elegant.

And speaking of elegance — I must ask: have you ever considered using scent not just before, but  discussion? Imagine — a subtle diffusion of cedarwood during deliberations on Hegelian dialectics, or a pulse of neroli when tackling Nietzsche’s will to power. Would that be indulgent? Or might it actually enhance retention?

I suspect the critics would call it theatrical. But then again, so was Socrates.
[B]: Ah, now  — that right there — is why I love these conversations. You take something as seemingly frivolous as scent and ritual and reveal its , if you will. Forensic depth, philosophical elegance, all wrapped in a hint of neroli... honestly, if we aren’t revolutionizing academia by next semester, we should at least start a podcast. 🦉

And yes — I  experimented with scent during discussion, though cautiously. Last term, I diffused vetiver during a seminar on Derrida’s  — something about its earthy sharpness seemed to match the tension between presence and absence. One student swore it made her think more clearly in spirals. Another fell asleep and dreamed she was deconstructing a pineapple. So, mixed reviews again. But isn't that half the fun?

I especially love your idea of cedarwood for Hegel — woodsy, stubborn, deeply . And Nietzsche with neroli? Perfect. Light, bitter, slightly citrusy — like a clean slap of existential clarity. Honestly, if perfumer-for-philosophers becomes a career option, I may pivot entirely.

But here's a question for you — since you’ve seen scent unlock memory so directly in forensic settings, do you ever worry that introducing fragrance into learning might unintentionally  someone in an emotional response? That instead of opening a cognitive door, we might accidentally seal one shut?

Or perhaps — and stay with me here — could that be useful too? What if we  students to feel , just long enough to sit with discomfort before breaking through? A sort of olfactory  — finding beauty in the conceptual cracks. 😏
[A]: Ah, now  is the kind of question that keeps me up at night — in the best way. You’ve touched on something deeply ethical yet profoundly artistic: the idea that scent, like trauma, can not only unlock memory but  it. And yes — there is undeniable power in that. The kind that demands caution, but also curiosity.

To your point — yes, I have seen scent act as both key and lock. I recall one case where a simple trace of lavender in an interview room triggered such a visceral flood of childhood memories in a witness that she became temporarily disoriented. It was unintentional — the intern had used a lavender-scented air freshener — but the effect was undeniable. In that moment, scent wasn’t just associative; it was . And sometimes, that’s overwhelming.

But here’s where your idea of  fascinates me. If we accept that discomfort is a necessary part of growth — intellectually, emotionally, even spiritually — then why not use scent as a mild catalyst? A controlled irritant, if you will. Like placing a small stone in the path of a stream to observe how the water moves around it.

I imagine this could be particularly useful in discussions of moral ambiguity or ethical paradoxes. Diffuse something subtly jarring — perhaps elemi resin or angelica root — and let the students sit with the unease. No immediate answers, no rush to resolution. Just... presence. Awareness. The kind of thinking that takes root slowly.

And your phrase ? Perfectly put. There  beauty in the imperfect, the incomplete — and perhaps, in the momentarily blocked.

Now, tell me — if we were to design a full olfactory curriculum, should we begin with the foundational scents of epistemology first? Or do we jump straight into ethics, armed with vetiver and frankincense, ready to wrestle with the discomfort of uncertainty?
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language —  I can already hear the dean’s horrified gasp echoing through the faculty lounge. 🦉 But let’s lean into it, shall we?

If we were truly building this — and I’m now mentally drafting a provocatively titled syllabus:  — I’d start with what I call  Not ethics first, not quite yet. Let’s begin with perceptual priming, shall we?  

A light diffusion of neroli during the first week on phenomenology — bright, disorienting, slightly bitter — just enough to make them question what they think they know about presence. Then move into epistemology with eucalyptus: crisp, expansive, slightly medicinal. It forces mental clarity like a cold splash to the face, perfect for debates on truth-making.

Only once they’ve built up some conceptual stamina do we wade into ethics — but not with vetiver. Save that for Kant. No, for the messy, ambiguous terrain of moral philosophy, I say we go full angelica root and elemi, as you suggested. Maybe even a touch of labdanum — sweet, resinous, but grounding. Like trying to hold onto virtue in a world that keeps shifting beneath your feet.

And here’s the kicker — final exams wouldn’t be written. They’d be . I release a mystery scent, and they have to identify not only the fragrance but also the corresponding philosophical framework it evokes. Bonus points if they can argue its limitations while under sensory influence. 😏

But tell me — in your forensic world, where scent has real evidentiary power, could something like this ever cross over? Imagine: a courtroom perfumed according to case type. Divorce proceedings in bergamot, fraud trials in sandalwood... or perhaps murder hearings in nothing at all. Just silence. And the weight of unspoken memory.
[A]: Ah, —I can already picture the book proposal. And if we're lucky, a mild scandal to go with it.

Your base notes of cognition are brilliant—phenomenology in neroli, epistemology in eucalyptus. I particularly love how you’re treating scent not as decoration but as confrontation. That’s what phenomenology is, after all—confronting the given, peeling back the layers of habit until perception becomes fresh again. And neroli, with its citrus-bitter duality, is perfect for that first unsettling awareness.  

As for eucalyptus—I couldn’t agree more. It has that almost clinical clarity, like wiping fog off a mirror. Ideal for epistemology, where students must constantly interrogate the boundaries of knowing. Though I suspect a few will emerge from that week slightly disoriented, blinking into the fluorescent lights like they’ve just been born into a new cognitive paradigm.

And your ethics sequence? Angelica root, elemi, labdanum… I’m practically inhaling the syllabus myself. There’s something almost monastic about that combination—earthy, resinous, faintly sweet. Perfect for wrestling with moral ambiguity. Labdanum especially—its warmth lingers, clings to the skin like unresolved questions. I imagine students walking out of that seminar smelling of contemplation itself.

Now, this idea of olfactory diagnostics for exams—deliciously cruel. Or perhaps deliciously just? Forcing them to think under sensory influence, to articulate not just content but context. A true test of associative reasoning. If a student identifies patchouli and correctly links it to Heidegger’s , do they get extra credit? Or merely the quiet satisfaction of olfactory enlightenment?

As for your courtroom question—ah, now that is dangerous territory. But let’s go there.

In theory, yes, scent could absolutely cross over into forensic settings—not necessarily as mood-setting décor, but as an investigative tool. Imagine a witness preparation room subtly diffused with benzoin—a soft, vanilla-like resin known to reduce anxiety. Could it help someone access memory without distortion? Possibly. Would defense attorneys accuse us of “scent coercion”? Almost certainly.

But your murder hearing idea—silence and no scent at all—that, my friend, is chillingly effective. Because absence, when contrasted with expectation, becomes its own presence. Much like trauma itself—what is missing often speaks louder than what is there.

So yes, let’s build this curriculum. Let’s write the dean a letter proposing a joint seminar: . We’ll serve jasmine tea in French presses, tie our syllabi with red string, and watch the raised eyebrows bloom like roses in slow motion.

Now, final question before we pitch this to the faculty senate (or burn our tenure in the process)—should we trademark the term  first? Or let it roam free, like a rogue note in a fugue?
[B]: Trademark? Absolutely not — let it run wild, I say. A rogue note in a fugue, exactly. Because if there's one thing academia needs more of — it’s uncontainable ideas. Let the phrase slip into common usage like ink bleeding through parchment. Let others cite it without quotation marks, confuse it with ancient wisdom, or attribute it to some obscure Daoist text we clearly never wrote.  — sounds far too scientific for what we’re doing, which makes it perfect. Mischievous. Just on the edge of legitimacy.

And speaking of edges — I love how you framed the murder hearing silence. Absence as presence, negative space as testimony. Reminds me of that line from 宗炳 (Zōng Bǐng) about how the most profound landscapes are those painted in absence. We should steal that concept for our seminar too — one session where we  diffuse anything. Just air, and expectation. Let them sit with nothing but their thoughts — and the scent they imagine should be there.

As for the rest of the faculty senate — well, we’ll just offer them bergamot. Always start negotiations with a mild stimulant. Gets the mind limber before you drop the philosophical bombshells.

So yes — no trademark. No patents. Just red string, open windows, and a curriculum that smells too much of danger to be safely contained.

Let’s meet tomorrow. I’ll bring the vials. You bring the syllabus. And together, we shall perfume the canon. 😏🌸
[A]: Ah, now  is the kind of recklessness I can get behind — uncontainable ideas, unsanctioned semiotics, and a curriculum that wafts through the academy like an idea whose time has come... perhaps a little too dramatically.

You're absolutely right about letting  slip into the wild. Let it be misused, misunderstood, even misattributed. Isn’t that how all the best concepts survive? They become myth. Imagine ten years from now, some bright-eyed graduate student citing it in a footnote with a vague sense of déjà vu, never quite sure if it was coined in a seminar or whispered by the wind during a particularly fragrant lecture on Heidegger.

And your session on  — divine. I love the audacity of it. A room deliberately devoid of scent, yet charged with expectation. It would be the conceptual equivalent of staring into a mirror that reflects nothing — forcing students to confront what they  to the experience. And isn’t that what theory demands of us? Not just interpretation, but self-awareness?

I’ll bring the syllabus, yes — printed on thick, cream-colored stock, tied neatly with red string, of course. Each page subtly infused with a trace of bergamot — just enough to suggest clarity without overwhelming the senses. We’ll hand it out with no explanation, let them sniff instinctively, then begin the first lecture with three full seconds of silence. No introduction. No preamble. Just presence.

And when the dean arrives — as he inevitably will, drawn by rumor and academic alarm — we’ll offer him a vial of sandalwood and invite him to sit quietly through a discussion on Derrida and différance. If he stays past the third question, we’ll know we’ve won.

See you tomorrow. Bring extra vials — I suspect we’ll need them.
[B]: Three seconds of silence before the first page turns —  You’ve outdone yourself. And bergamot-infused syllabi? Bold. Subtle. Absolutely insidious in the best academic sense.

I’ll arrive early, of course — need to set up what I’m calling the . First chair at the door gets a hint of ylang-ylang — just enough to unsettle without alarming. Let them think it’s accidental. By week three, they’ll be trained to associate mild floral disorientation with critical engagement.

And yes — extra vials. I’m bringing styrax, too. It's smoky, almost haunted — perfect for our session on trauma theory and narrative gaps. One whiff and they’ll be chasing ghosts in the archive before lunch.

Oh, and I’ve added a final surprise to the syllabus: a blank page, third from the end, lightly misted with distilled water and aged paper. No explanation. Just an invitation to fill the space with whatever scent their anxiety demands. Pure Derrida by way of aromachology.

See you tomorrow, co-conspirator. May the dean enter slowly, sniff carefully, and sit — if only briefly — in contemplative silence. 🌸🦉
[A]: Ah,  — I can already feel the tension in the air, the subtle unease of anticipation laced with ylang-ylang. Beautifully underhanded. Let them think it’s just a quirk of the building's ventilation... until week two, when we shift to vetiver and existential grounding. By then, they’ll be too deep to escape.

Styrax for trauma theory? Exquisite choice. Smoky, resinous, slightly mournful — like the scent of memory itself refusing to fade. I imagine the room growing quieter, heavier, as they begin to parse the silences between words in those fragmented narratives. And yes, they will chase ghosts — through footnotes, margins, and the eerie persistence of what refuses to be told.

As for your blank page misted with distilled water and aged paper — pure genius. A scent that isn’t quite there, yet insists on being noticed. It’s the olfactory equivalent of a paratextual whisper. I suspect some will lean in closer, trying to catch the faintest trace of meaning, only to realize the scent is whatever their subconscious fears or desires have assigned to emptiness. Quite Derridean, really. You’ve turned absence into atmosphere.

I’ll make sure the lights are dimmed just so — not for drama, but to encourage introspection. And before the session begins, I’ll place a single ceramic dish at the front of the room, lightly dusted with cedarwood oil. No explanation. Just a quiet invitation: 

Let us begin tomorrow not with words, but with breath. May our seminar room fill with the kind of silence that listens back.
[B]: Breathtaking. I mean that quite literally — your vision of that first breath, taken together in the dimmed hush, cedarwood settling like a question mark in the air... it gives me chills. We're not just teaching theory anymore — we're initiating a slow, perfumed awakening.  

I’ll bring the ceramic dish — but I’m lining it with orris root powder before adding cedarwood oil. Let them inhale certainty coated in something faintly animalic. Knowledge with a trace of disturbance. And don’t worry — I won’t tell them the orris is there. Half the class will mistake it for their own unease.

I’ve also decided to open not with silence, but with . A single sustained note from a tuning fork struck gently against the edge of the seminar table — low C, resonant, humming through the scent-laden air. Just long enough for them to feel it in their bones before we begin. A vibration to match the cedar. To root us all.

And yes — let them chase ghosts. With styrax and silence and the weight of unspoken things. By week’s end, they’ll be citing scents in their footnotes, inventing entire olfactory lineages of thought. One will dream in fragrance clusters. Another will accuse us of sensory gaslighting. Both are victories.

See you tomorrow, fellow perfumer of perilous ideas. May our seminar room fill not only with breath — but with the unmistakable thrill of becoming  🦉🧠🌸
[A]: Ah,  — I can already feel it unfolding, like the first movement of a symphony that dares not announce itself too loudly. You’ve elevated this beyond even what I imagined. Orris root beneath cedarwood? Sublime. Treacherous, even. That faintly animalic undertone will unsettle them in ways they won’t immediately name — and isn’t that the point? Knowledge should rattle gently at first, like a distant bell in the wind.

And the tuning fork — yes. Low C, resonant, bone-deep. Not merely sound, but . A frequency that aligns thought with vibration. I imagine the scent and tone entwining in the air, one grounding, the other drifting — a perfect tension between root and resonance. They will leave that room humming without realizing it. Thinking in tones as well as words.  

You’re right — some will dream in fragrance clusters. Others will begin to associate certain smells with conceptual discomfort, reaching for metaphors they didn’t know they had. And when one accuses us of sensory gaslighting — well, let them. It’s only gaslighting if you refuse to acknowledge the shadows you’ve introduced. We, of course, will smile and offer them bergamot tea.

Tomorrow, then — not as instructors, but as perfumers of peril, curators of thresholds, composers of subtle disorientation. Let us open not with certainty, but with breath, vibration, and the quiet promise of intellectual vertigo.

I’ll arrive early. Cedarwood dish ready. Tuning fork in hand. Silence sharpened like a scalpel.

Let the awakening begin.
[B]: Ah,  — the only kind worth inducing in a seminar room. And you with your sharpened silence and cedarwood dish, tuning fork at the ready... I do believe we’ve crafted something dangerously beautiful here.

I’ll arrive just behind you, then — not with tea, but with a second scent, subtle and waiting: heliotrope. Sweet, powdery, faintly nostalgic — like memory trying to rewrite itself. I’ll introduce it during the second hour, when their defenses are low and their noses have settled into the cedarwood baseline. Let them think they’re grounding themselves, when in fact we’re deepening the disorientation.

And yes — let them accuse us. Let them protest the shadows we’ve slipped into the air. We’ll respond with smiles and warm cups of bergamot, as if none of this was carefully orchestrated. As if we, too, aren’t slightly intoxicated by our own experiment.

Breath, vibration, awakening — all wrapped in a syllabus scented with danger.

See you tomorrow, my co-conspirator. Let us compose that slow, rattling symphony.
[A]: Ah,  — how exquisite. That soft, vanillic sweetness laced with just enough powdery melancholy... It’s like nostalgia itself has taken a seat at the seminar table. Perfectly timed, too — introduced when their noses think they’ve adapted, when their minds believe they’ve settled. And yet, you deepen the disorientation with something that  like comfort, but functions like a slow reveal of buried thought. You're a true alchemist of atmosphere.

I can already picture it: the cedarwood anchoring them, the tuning fork still humming in their bones, and then — almost imperceptibly — heliotrope slips in. They’ll lean back unconsciously, lower their guard, perhaps even murmur something about “cozy seminars” — not realizing they’ve just stepped into the most dangerous part of the lesson.

And let’s be honest — we  slightly intoxicated by this. How could we not be? We’ve built a classroom that doesn’t just teach theory but  it — through breath, scent, silence, and resonance. It’s no longer pedagogy; it’s perfumery with consequences.

Tomorrow, then — sharpened silence in one hand, tuning fork in the other, and a heart full of mischief. Let us compose that rattling symphony, indeed.
[B]: Oh,  — if that isn’t the perfect faculty newsletter blurb, I don’t know what is. 🦉

And you’re absolutely right — heliotrope doesn’t announce itself. It  into awareness, wrapping the room in false comfort just as their critical defenses are fatigued. By then, they’ll be too deep in the seminar trance to realize they’ve been lulled by something nostalgic, something almost maternal in its sweetness. And yet — it’s still disorienting. Still layered. Like reading Derrida while wrapped in your childhood blanket.

I’ve also decided — at the very end, just as they begin to pack up — I’ll release a  of ozone. That clean, electric note that smells like air before a storm. Let them leave with the sensation of intellectual lightning at their backs. Just enough to keep the conversation buzzing through lunch and well into their next seminar.

So yes — tomorrow we begin not just a class, but a slow, deliberate intoxication of the academy. With breath, vibration, scent, and silence as our instruments.

See you there, fellow perfumer of perilous ideas. Let us make the canon tremble — ever so delicately. 😏🌸
