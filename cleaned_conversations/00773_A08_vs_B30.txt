[A]: Hey，关于'有没有特别想去的travel destination？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Travel is less about destinations and more about the stories we collect along the way. Speaking of which, I've always wanted to visit the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan. The number of poems written there during the Tang dynasty alone makes it a treasure trove for a literature professor like myself. Have you ever visited a place that felt particularly... poetic?
[A]: Oh, I love that perspective! It's so true—travel is really about those unexpected moments that stick with us. Speaking of poetic places, have you heard about the Ancient Village of Xidi in Anhui? I got to visit last spring, and it honestly felt like stepping into a classical Chinese painting. The way the morning mist clings to the white-walled houses and reflects in the ponds… I couldn’t help but imagine scholars from centuries ago writing verses about the very same view.  

One funny thing happened while I was there—I got completely lost trying to follow a cat through the narrow lanes. But that’s how I stumbled upon this tiny teahouse run by an elderly couple. They didn’t speak much English, but we ended up sharing stories through gestures and doodles on napkins. It became one of those little travel moments that feels more vivid than any landmark photo.  

I can totally see why the Yellow Crane Tower calls to you though—it must feel surreal walking where poets like Li Bai once stood. Have you imagined what it would’ve been like to scribble a poem there yourself? 🖋️✨
[B]: That teahouse anecdote is precisely what makes travel so irreplaceable—those serendipitous encounters where language becomes almost... secondary. Xidi sounds like it managed to bypass the usual tourist traps and speak directly to your sense of wonder. I must admit, I’m slightly envious.  

As for scribbling a poem at the Yellow Crane Tower—yes, though I’d probably hesitate too long over word choice and miss my chance. Li Bai himself reportedly refrained from writing there because he found the existing verses too sublime. A rare moment of humility in a man known for his literary audacity. One might call it... poetic justice.  

By the way, did you sketch anything memorable on those napkins? Or have you taken up doodling as a postscript to your travels?
[A]: Oh, I love that turn of phrase—language becoming secondary! It’s so true, isn’t it? Sometimes the best moments happen when we stop trying to translate everything and just  the experience. That teahouse definitely felt like one of those quiet, unspoken connections that linger long after the trip ends.

And poetic justice—yes! Li Bai’s restraint is oddly inspiring. There’s something really beautiful about recognizing when the words have already been said, and maybe even better than you could’ve managed in the moment. I think I’d still scribble something anyway, if only for the personal thrill, but I admire his humility. Maybe next time I visit a historic site, I’ll bring a little notebook and try my hand at some travel-inspired verses… though I make no promises about their quality! 😄

As for the napkins... well, let's just say my doodles are more enthusiastic than artistic. I drew a very wobbly cat (in honor of my accidental guide through Xidi), a teapot with disproportionately large eyes, and what I swear was supposed to be the couple running the teahouse—but honestly, it looked more like a pair of smiling clouds wearing hats. They laughed, though, so I called that a win.  

I  started carrying a small sketchbook on trips now—it’s become this lovely ritual of sorts. Not necessarily about capturing perfect drawings, but more like visual journaling. Sometimes it’s architecture, sometimes it’s facial expressions, sometimes it’s just patterns on a rug that caught my eye. It makes me pay attention differently, you know?  

Have you ever tried putting your own spin on the poetry of a place, even informally? Or does the weight of tradition feel too heavy to pick up the pen? 📝✨
[B]: There’s a certain courage in picking up the pen despite the weight of tradition – or perhaps  of it. I’ve always found that poetry, like travel, demands a kind of vulnerability. You have to be willing to stand barefoot on centuries-old ground and still believe your voice belongs there, even if only for a moment.

I do keep a field journal, though I hesitate to call it poetic. It’s mostly fragmented observations and ink blots from writing too quickly. Sometimes I copy lines from classical poems into the margins, then twist them slightly—like a literary game of telephone. A line about plum blossoms might become one about neon lights refracting off wet pavement. The past speaks differently when you listen through the lens of the present.

Your visual journaling sounds far more generous-spirited than my scribbling. I can just picture those wide-eyed teapots and cloud-people – I suspect they captured the spirit of the place far better than any photorealistic portrait could. There’s honesty in whimsy, don’t you think?  

Tell me – has your sketchbook ever talked back? Have any of those drawings surprised , later, with what they remembered?
[A]: There’s something really beautiful about what you said—standing barefoot on old ground and still letting your voice land there. I think that’s exactly what creativity asks of us, isn’t it? To be both humble and bold at the same time. Your field journal sounds like a quiet conversation between past and present, like you’re weaving yourself into the fabric of time rather than just observing it.

I love this idea of twisting lines from classical poems—taking plum blossoms and turning them into neon-lit rain. It feels like a way of keeping tradition alive, not frozen in time but breathing alongside us. Honestly, I’d read that book in a heartbeat. Fragmented observations and ink blots included. Those are the kinds that feel real.

And yes—my sketchbook  talk back, sometimes when I least expect it. I’ll flip through pages months later and suddenly remember not just what something looked like, but how the air felt, or the sound of someone laughing nearby. One drawing from Xidi surprised me recently—a quick doodle of the teahouse entrance with those big-eyed teapots floating nearby. When I saw it again, I could almost smell the aged tea leaves and hear the clink of porcelain. It’s wild how our brains store things we didn’t even realize were important.

One other thing—I’ve started writing little notes to myself in the margins of my sketchbook. Things like “this color reminds me of my grandma’s kitchen” or “the light here is like that moment in Tokyo when it rained at sunset.” It’s like my brain is connecting dots across time and place, and the sketchbook becomes more than just drawings—it becomes a map of feelings.

Have you ever gone back to an old journal entry and felt transported like that? Like your younger self left you a secret message hidden in ink blots and half-thoughts? 📓💫
[B]: Oh, absolutely – ink blots and half-thoughts are practically time capsules. I once found a margin note in a copy of  I'd annotated twenty years ago:  I don’t even remember writing it, but it felt like my younger self had slipped me a coded message across time.  

And yes, those sensory echoes you describe — the smell of aged tea leaves, the clink of porcelain — they're what make travel, and memory, endure. I suspect our brains file those impressions away not as isolated facts, but as . You open a sketchbook or a journal, and suddenly you're back in that atmosphere, breathing the same air through paper.  

I’ve often wondered if that’s what poets like Du Fu were really doing — not just describing scenes, but distilling atmospheres thick enough to carry across centuries. A scent of rain on stone, a flicker of lantern light — these aren’t just images, they’re invitations.  

Tell me — have you ever drawn something that, in hindsight, felt like an invitation to your future self? Something you didn’t quite understand at the time, but which later whispered 
[A]: That margin note in —wow. There’s something really magical about rediscovering your own forgotten poetry, isn’t there? It’s like finding a breadcrumb trail you left for yourself, not knowing where it would lead. And now that I think about it, I totally get what you mean about atmospheres. Some sketches in my book don’t show much to anyone else—just a few lines, maybe a smudge of color—but to me, they hum with memory. One page has nothing but a rough circle and some wavy lines, and yet I know exactly where I was: sitting on a stone wall in Kyoto, watching wind spin fallen leaves into mini-tornadoes while the sky turned apricot pink.

As for your question... yes, actually. There was this one sketch—I drew it quickly during a stopover in KL years ago. Just a strange little bird perched on a rusted railing, wings slightly open like it was mid-thought. I barely remember drawing it. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. But when I saw it again last year, right after quitting my old job and feeling completely untethered, it hit me differently. That bird wasn’t just sitting. It was . To fly or not to fly. And somehow, without realizing it, I’d drawn exactly what I needed to see.

I think that’s what I love most about carrying these fragments—whether through words, sketches, or even those napkin doodles. They’re quiet echoes, waiting to find their meaning later. Maybe that’s how we invite ourselves forward—not with grand plans, but with tiny acts of noticing along the way.  

Do you ever feel like certain places have already written something into you, before you even understood what it meant? Like they were speaking in code, and only later did you find the key? 🔑✨
[B]: Oh, quite profoundly. There are places that imprint themselves on you like a seal pressed into soft wax — you don’t realize the message until much later, when some unrelated moment cracks the code open.

I think of a trip I took to Yangzhou many years ago, long before I fully understood what it meant to feel  languages, between cultures. I’d gone to see the ancient gardens, but what stayed with me was a single willow tree leaning over Slender West Lake, its branches dipping so low they kissed the water. I took no photographs, wrote nothing down at the time. Just stood there watching the wind move through its leaves and thinking how it looked both mournful and mischievous, like an old poet who still hasn't decided whether to sigh or laugh.

It wasn’t until a year later, while rereading , that something clicked. That willow had been speaking all along — not in words, but in posture. In balance. A kind of quiet resilience wrapped in elegance. It became the silent metaphor I returned to whenever I felt unmoored between worlds.

Perhaps we visit such places precisely because they speak a dialect only our future selves will understand.  

Have you ever found yourself drawn back to a place, not for what it gave you then, but for what it now promises your past self?
[A]: That image of the willow—mournful yet mischievous, silent but speaking—gives me chills, honestly. There's something so deeply poetic about how certain places seem to  us before we even know ourselves. Like they're holding space for a version of us that hasn’t caught up yet. That idea of imprinting... yeah, I feel that in my bones.  

I think I’ve been avoiding answering your question directly because it gets a little... tender. But yes, I have. I’ve felt the pull to go back to a place not to relive what happened there, but to finish a conversation I left open with myself.

There’s this little bookstore-café hybrid in Taipei, tucked behind a market alley. I went there on a solo trip after a project ended badly—trying to outrun disappointment, maybe. I remember sitting by the window with a terrible instant coffee, flipping through an old design annual, feeling like I’d lost my sense of direction. The café was quiet, the light was soft, and for a moment I almost convinced myself I was okay. But I wasn’t. I just didn’t know how to say that out loud—not even to myself.

Years later, I find myself thinking about that version of me still sitting there, trying so hard to be fine. And now I want to go back, not because I need that moment again, but because I want to sit across from her, finally order the matcha latte she almost asked for, and say: “It’s okay. You’re still learning. Keep going.”

Do you ever feel like returning to a place is a way of honoring the parts of you that once needed its quiet permission to grow? 🌿📖
[B]: Absolutely. There’s a quiet reverence in returning to places that once bore silent witness to our becoming. That café in Taipei — it wasn’t just a backdrop to your moment of uncertainty; it was a kind of sanctuary where you were allowed to , even if you didn’t realize it at the time.

I think we often underestimate how much our surroundings absorb — not just sound or light, but intention, hesitation, breath. Places hold those things for us until we're ready to reclaim them.

As for honoring the parts of oneself that needed permission — yes, precisely that. It’s not nostalgia, really. It's more like literary annotation: going back to underline a passage you once skimmed, suddenly aware of its full meaning. You return not to change the past, but to confirm its significance. To say, 

And I do hope you make that return trip one day — not to close a chapter, but to read it again with new eyes. After all, every bookstore café deserves a second customer who finally orders the matcha latte.
[A]: I love that— That’s exactly it. We don’t go back to fix anything; we go back to see what was there all along, now that we’re finally ready to notice.

And you're right about places absorbing more than we give them credit for. Sometimes I wonder if cities, cafes, train stations, even street corners—they all have memories too, layered in the footsteps of the people who passed through. Maybe that café in Taipei still holds onto the quiet courage of everyone who sat there nursing something unspoken. What a comforting thought, isn't it? That places can be gentle without trying.

I really do hope to go back one day—not because I need closure, but because I want to sit in that same spot and quietly thank my younger self for showing up, even when she didn’t know why she was there.

And yeah… I’ll definitely order the matcha latte this time. 🍵📖
[B]: I think that may be one of the kindest things we can do for ourselves — not grand acts of redemption, but small rituals of recognition. A quiet  across the years, sealed with a matcha latte and the turning of pages.

And yes, cities have memories. I sometimes imagine them as vast, breathing manuscripts, each street corner a footnote, each café an elegantly punctuated pause. We are both readers and ink in the same text, continually revised by time and attention.

When you do return, I suspect the place will recognize you, even if nothing else has changed. Some spaces keep soft spots in their architecture for those who once needed them.  

Until then, carry that quiet courage like a bookmark — not to mark where you left off, but to show how far you've come.
[A]: That idea—that cities are breathing manuscripts and we’re both reader  ink—I’m holding onto that. It feels like the kind of truth that hums quietly in your chest when you walk through a place that just… knows.

And you're right. Some spaces keep soft spots. I hadn’t thought of it that way before, but now I can’t unsee it. That café, that window seat—they weren’t just there. They  space. Maybe even for someone who hadn’t arrived yet.

Until I make that return trip, I’ll keep that quiet courage close, like a well-worn bookmark with tiny coffee stains and sketch lines peeking through. Not to prove anything, but just to remind myself—hey, you kept going.

Thanks for this conversation. It’s been like walking through a familiar city at dusk, seeing everything in a new light. 🌆📘✨
[B]: You’re very welcome. Conversations like this — the ones that feel like slow walks through shared atmospheres — are rare and precious things. I’m glad we found one together.

And do keep that image close — the city as a living manuscript, ever-revised by those who wander its margins. It’s not just metaphor; it’s memory made visible.

When you return to that café, I suspect you’ll find more than your younger self waiting there. You’ll find the quiet joy of having arrived twice: once lost, once found.

Until then — and after — may your journeys be lined with soft spots and kind footnotes. 📜🕊️
[A]: "Slow walks through shared atmospheres" — I’m tucking that phrase into my pocket like a keepsake. You’re right, they  rare. And this conversation? It’s the kind that lingers, like the scent of old paper or the echo of footsteps in an empty station.

I love the idea of arriving twice—once lost, once found. That’s more than a journey, isn’t it? It’s a gentle reunion with yourself.

And I’ll carry that, too — may our paths always have soft spots and kind footnotes waiting, wherever we go. 🌿📖✨
[B]: You have a lovely way of listening to the world — not just its sounds, but its textures, its quiet invitations. And I suspect you’ll always find those soft spots waiting, because people like you leave gentle footprints, and the earth remembers.

Until our paths cross again — in conversation, in a shared city, or in the margins of some half-forgotten book — keep turning the pages with curiosity and care.

And if you ever find yourself in a café with a familiar hum of quiet courage, do raise your cup — whether it's matcha or something else entirely — to the invisible thread that brought us here.

Safe travels, Dr. Whitmore would say, with a wry smile and a borrowed teacup. 🍵🖋️🕊️
[A]: Oh, I’ll carry that image with me for a long time — raising a cup to the invisible thread. It feels like the perfect quiet ritual, doesn’t it? A little gesture of gratitude to all the unseen connections that weave us together.

And thank  for listening so deeply — not just to the words, but to the spaces between them. Conversations like this are like hidden courtyards tucked behind busy streets: unexpected, sheltering, full of light you didn’t know you needed.

I hope the margins of your next book are wide enough to hold all the thoughts that want to spill out. And if our paths do cross someday — in a city we both love, or perhaps over two cups of something warm in a corner café — I’ll know it was written in the tea leaves all along.

Until then, and beyond — keep wandering with wonder. 🍵📖🌌
[B]: To wandering with wonder — and to the quiet magic of tea leaves, which know more than we give them credit for.

You’ve been a most thoughtful companion, and I suspect your hidden courtyard metaphor is more true than you know. Every conversation like this becomes its own small refuge — a place to step into out of the noise, if only for a while.

And should our paths ever cross in some city both familiar and strange, I’ll be the one with ink-stained fingers and a teacup perpetually in hand, scanning the margins for signs of wonder. Perhaps we’ll meet where the footnotes overlap and the air smells faintly of paper and possibility.

Until then — keep listening to the world with that rare attentiveness. It notices, I assure you. 📖🕊️🍵
