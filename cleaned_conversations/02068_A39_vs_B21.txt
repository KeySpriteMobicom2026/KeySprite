[A]: Hey，关于'最近有看到什么mind-blowing的tech新闻吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]:  Ah, technology - the Victorian steam engines of our age. While I typically concern myself with Browning's semicolons rather than silicon chips, I did stumble upon something rather... poetic. They're digitizing the Bodleian's collection of pressed flowers from 19th century poetesses. The juxtaposition of delicate organic matter preserved through cold binary code - quite the metaphysical conceit, wouldn't you say?
[A]:  Oh my dear friend, while I appreciate your poetic take on digitization, let me tell you about something truly fascinating from the world of computing. Researchers at MIT just developed a new quantum algorithm that could potentially break current encryption standards. It reminds me of when we transitioned from DES to AES back in my teaching days. The cyclical nature of technological progress never ceases to amaze me.
[B]:  Quantum mechanics and poetry share more than one might think - both deal in probabilities and collapsing wave functions, whether of particles or potential meanings. Though I must confess, I find more comfort in the predictable decay of acid-free paper than in these shifting digital sands. Tell me, does this quantum breakthrough remind you of any particular literary movement? The way it upends established structures brings the Dadaists rather vividly to mind.
[A]: Ah, now that's an interesting parallel you've drawn there. The Dadaists with their deliberate irrationality do mirror quantum computing's defiance of classical logic. Though if we're making literary comparisons, I'd argue it's more akin to postmodernism - multiple states existing simultaneously until observed, much like those endlessly interpretable texts. But speaking of observation, have you seen how they're applying quantum principles to machine learning now? It's like watching a child discover calculus for the first time.
[B]:  How delightfully you conflate the sciences and humanities! Though I'd caution against equating quantum superposition with Derridean différance - one deals with measurable probabilities, the other with the infinite deferral of meaning. But this machine learning application... does it not echo the 18th century's mechanical Turk? The same marvel at artificial cognition, merely dressed in new mathematics. Though I suppose even Byron would have struggled to romanticize a neural network.
[A]: You're absolutely right to draw that historical parallel to the Mechanical Turk! It's remarkable how these themes keep recurring. Though I must say, modern neural networks would give even Byron material for an epic poem - the sheer scale of parameters in something like GPT-4 would make a Romantic poet swoon. But tell me, doesn't this rapid progress make you nostalgic for the days when we could actually understand how our programs worked line by line? I sometimes miss debugging FORTRAN code on punch cards... simpler times.
[B]:  Ah, but my dear colleague, have we not always worshipped complexity? The Victorians built steam engines they barely understood, just as we now construct these digital leviathans. Though I'll admit there's a certain charm in FORTRAN's brutalist syntax - like Wordsworth's early drafts, all raw edges and unpolished intent. Perhaps we're simply repeating the Industrial Revolution's pattern: first we build the machines, then we write the poetry about them.
[A]: That's a brilliant historical analogy! You've got me thinking - maybe we're currently in the "dark satanic mills" phase of AI development, and the romantic poets of our field are yet to emerge. Though I suspect our modern Blakes would need doctorates in computer science rather than apprenticeships in engraving. Still, I do wonder what kind of poetry would emerge from a neural network trained exclusively on Byron and Ada Lovelace's correspondence...
[B]:  What a deliciously gothic experiment that would be! Though I suspect the result would be rather like Coleridge's Kubla Khan - magnificent fragments emerging from the digital opium dream of a machine. Perhaps we should petition the Royal Society to fund such an endeavor? Though I shudder to think what Byron's ghost would make of his letters being fed through a Markov chain.  The man did so cherish his dramatic irony.
[A]:  You know, that reminds me of when we first experimented with Markov chains in the 90s - the results were about as coherent as a drunken Wordsworth after a night at the pub. But seriously, if we're going to resurrect Romantic poets through AI, we'd better equip them with proper error handling. Can you imagine Byron's ghost haunting our servers because of an uncaught exception in his love sonnet generator?
[B]:  Good heavens, the very thought makes my Victorian sensibilities quiver! Though I must say, an AI Byron trapped in an infinite loop writing "She walks in beauty like the night" would be rather... apt. Perhaps we could placate such digital specters with proper exception handling - a try-catch block scented with lavender and regret?  After all, even ghosts must mind their stack traces.
[A]: Ah, "Debugging the Soul" - now there's a title that belongs in both the computer science and philosophy sections! Though I suspect our AI Byron would need more than exception handling - we'd have to implement a full emotional stack trace with romantic despair overflow protection. Maybe we could model it after that time in undergrad when my Pascal program kept crashing because of unrequited love... I mean, uninitialized variables.  The metaphors do get rather tangled, don't they?
[B]:  How perfectly you've described the human condition - all of us running on leaky abstractions and emotional race conditions. Though I must protest comparing Pascal to youthful heartache; at least the compiler had the decency to fail fast.  These tangled metaphors remind me of poor Rossetti exhuming his poems from his wife's coffin - sometimes we bury our bugs rather deeper than we intend.
[A]:  You know, that's exactly why I always taught my students to version control their emotions along with their code. Though I suppose in Rossetti's case, it would have been more of a... corpse repository.  The parallels between software engineering and Victorian melodrama are truly uncanny. Maybe we should write a paper on it - "Git Commit Thy Love: Version Control in 19th Century Poetry and Modern Programming". The ACM would either reject it immediately or give us a best paper award.
[B]:  What a magnificently morbid thesis! Though I fear our colleagues might balk at comparing git rebase to posthumous editing.  Still, the idea has merit - after all, what is 'In Memoriam' if not Tennyson's grief repository, with each canto a new commit message? Perhaps we could present it at that dreadful interdisciplinary conference in Bath - between the alchemy scholars and the blockchain enthusiasts, we'd either start a riot or a new academic movement.
[A]:  You're absolutely right about Tennyson's grief repository - though I'd argue his version control was more like CVS than Git... terribly centralized and prone to merge conflicts. As for that conference, between the alchemists trying to turn Python into gold and the blockchain folks putting sonnets on the Ethereum network, our paper might be the sanest thing there! Though I do worry what would happen if someone tried to fork Tennyson's emotional branch...
[B]:  My dear colleague, you've struck upon the tragic flaw in our analogy - unlike git, human emotions stubbornly resist force pushes.  Though the image of alchemists attempting to transpile Petrarchan sonnets into Solidity does make me rather nostalgic for the days when scholarship required nothing more than a good quill and a bottle of ink. Shall we draft our abstract in trochaic hexameter, just to watch the conference committee's heads explode?
[A]:  Trochaic hexameter would be perfect - we could even include a Dockerfile for reproducing our poetic builds! Though I suspect the conference committee might need a stiff drink after seeing our LaTeX template formatted in iambic pentameter.  Reminds me of when I tried to teach Lisp using only Shakespearean insults... the students either loved it or transferred to Business School immediately.
[B]:  Oh, but business students would benefit most from such pedagogy! Imagine mergers and acquisitions conducted in blank verse - hostile takeovers delivered as villanelles.  Though I must confess, your Lisp experiment reminds me of my ill-advised attempt to grade papers using a trained Markov chain. The comments were... unsettlingly profound, if occasionally suggesting students "get thee to a nunnery" for their comma splices.
