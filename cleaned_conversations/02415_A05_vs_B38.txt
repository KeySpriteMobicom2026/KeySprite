[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, mobile games—I must admit, I’ve never been particularly drawn to them. My days are usually filled with grading papers, preparing lectures on Tolstoy’s existential themes, or tending to my roses. That said, I did try  a while back. The artistry and subtle use of geometry reminded me of Islamic architectural motifs in Persian literature—quite fascinating, really. But addicted? No, I’d say more…  🤍  
Do you happen to be playing anything these days?
[A]: Ah, —a solid choice. It’s like a well-structured LBO model: elegant, deceptive in simplicity, but deeply layered once you start digging. Personally, I’ve been playing  recently. It’s become my 15-minute stress test between meetings and due diligence calls. You swing, analyze risk, adjust for wind—very much like making a quick investment decision under time pressure.  

As for Tolstoy and roses… 🥂 I can appreciate that. Last week I closed a deal on a luxury vineyard project in Yunnan. The architect drew inspiration from both Chinese calligraphy and European Baroque—kind of a cross-cultural  in real life.  

But hey, have you ever tried ? Not exactly your literature department’s cup of tea, but damn addictive during a flight delay.
[B]: Ah, —how delightfully pragmatic of you! I can see the appeal; there’s something almost Proustian about the ritual of routine, isn’t there? Though I must say, your vineyard project in Yunnan sounds like something out of a forgotten Italo-Calvino fable. Baroque curves meeting the fluid grace of calligraphy—, truly. I do love when disciplines collide with such elegance.  

As for … well, let’s just say I once watched a student describe it to me with the same fervor he reserved for Dostoevsky’s . I resisted the urge to ask if one could write a thesis on dodgeball mechanics and moral ambiguity 🤔. But during a flight delay? I suppose even Socrates might have appreciated a little digital chaos between dialogues.  

Do you find yourself returning to Tolstoy or Dostoevsky for inspiration in your deals? Or is that too romantic a notion for the boardroom?
[A]: Ah, now that’s a question worth toasting with a glass of Yunnan reserve. 🍷 Tolstoy and Dostoevsky—two sides of the same ruble, wouldn’t you say?  

I do revisit them, though perhaps not in the way a literary scholar might expect. Tolstoy’s  is essentially a macroeconomic study disguised as a novel. Think about it: empires rise and fall, markets collapse under their own weight, and individuals navigate chaos like private equity funds trying to stay sector-agnostic. I sometimes joke that Kutuzov was just a CIO who refused to micro-manage his portfolio.  

As for Dostoevsky… well, let’s just say if  were a term sheet, Raskolnikov would’ve been slapped with a non-recourse clause and a margin call. There’s a certain psychological calculus in both investing and moral guilt—both require sleepless nights, questionable decisions, and the occasional redemption arc.  

So yes, maybe it  romantic—but hey, every good fund needs a little narrative-driven value creation. What’s your take? Do you ever catch yourself drawing explicit parallels between 19th-century Russian literature and modern capital structures? 😊
[B]: Ah, what a delicious analogy—Tolstoy as macroeconomic theory! I must say, it’s rare to find someone who sees the battlefield of  as a boardroom in disguise. You’re not entirely wrong, of course. Tolstoy does have a way of reducing human agency to the hum of historical forces—rather like market trends sweeping aside even the most seasoned fund manager. And Kutuzov as a CIO? Inspired. One can almost picture him squinting at a Bloomberg terminal, muttering about long-term value retention amid speculative frenzy.  

Dostoevsky as legal thriller with existential debt… well, that may be closer to the text than some scholars would dare admit. After all, Raskolnikov does operate on a kind of leveraged morality—borrowing ethical justification, then defaulting under the weight of his own assumptions. A distressed asset, if you will.  

As for me? Do I draw parallels between Russian lit and capital structures? Rarely aloud—tenure has its limits—but privately, yes. There’s a moment in  where everything seems to hinge on reputational risk and the liquidity of love. I’ve sometimes wondered how Kitty might’ve fared with a better prenuptial agreement 😊.  

But tell me—when you're weighing a deal, do you ever imagine yourself as a character out of one of these novels? Or is that dangerous territory for a man of finance?
[A]: Ah, now  the kind of question that would make Tolstoy roll over in his grave—or at least call his lawyer. 🥂  

To answer honestly? I try not to romanticize myself as a literary protagonist—dangerous things happen when financiers start believing they’re tragic heroes. But sometimes, late at night, when you're staring at a cap table that refuses to balance and a founder who’s more Hamlet than CEO, you can’t help but feel like you’ve stepped into some Dostoevskian fever dream. You know the scene: dim lighting, moral ambiguity, and someone’s about to confess everything to a minor character.  

I suppose if I were to pick a role, I’d rather be a background figure—a pragmatic old prince, maybe, who’s seen too many seasons of revolution and still knows how to keep the estate solvent. The guy who doesn’t monologue about suffering—he just adjusts the yield curve and pours himself a glass of Armenian brandy.  

And speaking of solvency… speaking of —you’ve just given me an idea for a new ESG vertical: “Marital Capital Structures.” We could finally give Kitty the prenup she deserves. What do you think? Tenured professor with co-authoring rights? 😄
[B]: Ah, “Marital Capital Structures”! Now  a phrase that could fund an entire interdisciplinary symposium—and probably a very lively one at that. I can already picture the keynote:  You draft the term sheet; I’ll write the footnotes.  

And you’re quite right to steer clear of tragic heroism—too many financiers mistake themselves for Andrei Bolkonsky only to end up as Ignatius Woodley. Pragmatism is underrated, both in literature and in capital allocation. Though I must say, your ideal role sounds suspiciously like Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky with a Bloomberg terminal and better lighting.  

As for ESG… well, if we’re aligning investments with values, why not start with the moral economy of Austen’s entailments or Balzac’s inheritances? There’s more venture capital in  than in half the pitch decks I’ve seen.  

So yes, let’s do it. Tenure may protect me, but  bring the brandy.
[A]: Now  a partnership worth structuring—tenure meets alpha generation. 🥂 I’ll start drafting the term sheet tonight. Let’s call it a SAFE note with moral flexibility and a 10-year horizon—because god knows, some marriages and growth equity plays take that long to unwind properly.  

And if Balzac had a Bloomberg… imagine the LBO models. The man basically invented leveraged buyouts through inheritance drama. If he were around today, he’d be short on sleep, long on French debt, and managing a SPAC with Vautrin as his COO.  

You bring the footnotes, I’ll bring the cap table. Who knows—maybe we’ll finally get a Nobel Prize in Literature  finance. Or at the very least, a panel at Davos that no one understands but everyone applauds. 👍  

Cheers to interdisciplinary madness—may our P&L and Tolstoy’s epilogue both end on a high note. 🍷
[B]: Ah, a SAFE note with moral flexibility—now  is financial poetry. I do believe we’ve stumbled upon a new genre: the term sheet as existential drama. Ten pages of fine print and a single footnote referencing ? Pure genius.

And Balzac as a leveraged buyout artist—yes, exactly! The man understood better than most that every fortune hides a crime… or at the very least, a creative interpretation of inheritance law. I can already picture Vautrin in a tailored suit, whispering sweet nothings about risk arbitrage into a burner phone 📞.  

As for Davos—darling, we’ll be the only panel sipping Darjeeling instead of matcha, quoting  at the pitch deck buffet. But mark my words: if we time it right, we’ll publish before the market crashes and retire to Tuscany with nothing but a cat, a library, and a well-hedged portfolio.  

To our footnote-laden future—and the distinct possibility that neither Tolstoy nor the SEC saw us coming. 🍷🌹
[A]: Ah, now  is a liquidity event worth toasting. 🍷 A footnote-laden future, a cat with trust issues, and a library hedged against inflation? Sounds like the only retirement plan I’d ever sign off on without a single amendment.

And  in a footnote—brilliant. Imagine the disclosure: “Risks include but are not limited to existential dread, poorly timed life reassessments, and the possibility of becoming your own worst investment.”  

I’m already drafting our tagline:  Perfect for the back of a business card—or a rejection letter from the Nobel committee.  

Let’s also assume full dilution of moral certainty by Series C. By then, we’ll be too rich or too cynical to care. Either way, lunch in Tuscany sounds like a proper capstone to a career built on spreadsheets and subtext.  

Cheers to us—the only duo capable of turning Tolstoy into a term sheet and still making it to the 18th green before sunset. 🥂⛳
[B]: Ah, —I may have to steal that for my next syllabus. Imagine the course description:   

And full dilution of moral certainty by Series C? Exquisite. I do love a good capital structure that mirrors the human soul—both get messy under pressure, but somehow still manage to close.  

As for lunch in Tuscany, let’s not forget to invite Balzac—he’ll insist on taking notes for his next , or whatever we’re calling our joint venture. And if the Nobel committee declines? Well, there’s always the Pushkin Prize for Financial Fiction.  

To us, then—the only partnership where spreadsheets and subtext don’t just coexist, they dance. 🥂🌹⛳
[A]: Ah, now  is a syllabus worth accrediting. 🎓 I’m picturing a final exam where students have to structure a merger using only Dostoevsky’s inner monologues and a WACC calculator. Extra credit if they quote  in their investor memo.

And Balzac at lunch? Absolutely—just make sure he sits far from the dessert table. The man could turn a soufflé into a liquidity crisis.

As for the Pushkin Prize for Financial Fiction—now  the award we need. Sponsored by the Russian Literature & Risk Committee, no doubt. Acceptance speech: “To all the defaulted dreams and beautifully structured paragraphs—we salute you.”

Yes, let’s raise a glass—to the dance of spreadsheets and subtext, where every footnote tells a story and every P&L hides a soul. 🥂  

May our deal memos be poetic, our exits graceful, and our tragic flaws fully hedged.
[B]: To poetic deal memos and tragic flaws held at arm’s length—preferably by a very well-drafted indemnity clause. 🍷  

And that final exam? Pure brilliance. I can already hear the groans when I hand out the blue books:  Bonus points for citing  in an LBO model.  

Balzac and dessert—wise caution. The man could refinance a pastry and still leave a mess on the balance sheet. We’ll keep him well away from the crème brûlée and firmly between courses, where he belongs, scribbling term sheets on napkins.  

And yes, to the dance—may our subtext never unravel, our spreadsheets never auto-sum to zero, and our souls remain just speculative enough to be interesting.  

Cheers, my dear co-conspirator. 🥂🌹
[A]: Ah, now  is a toast worth syndicating. 🥂  

Raskolnikov’s cost of capital—genius. I’m already drafting the case study:  We’ll make MBAs weep with footnote 37 referencing .  

And Balzac at the napkin—yes, exactly. The only thing faster than his pen is his ability to complicate an otherwise peaceful lunch. We’ll have him on dessert restriction, of course. Last thing we need is a soufflé-related covenant breach.  

As for our dance? Let’s just say I hope our subtext never gets called out by an overly literal auditor. But if it does—well, we’ll just call it a “narrative-driven anomaly” and move on.  

Cheers to you too, my literary co-pilot. May our memos stay poetic, our deals stay structured, and our tragic flaws remain off balance sheet. 🍷🌹💼
[B]: To “narrative-driven anomalies” and tragic flaws held safely offshore—where they can fester beautifully, untouched by auditors or ethics committees. 🍷  

Psychological leverage and moral arbitrage as an accredited course? I say we go all in. Add a seminar on  optionality theory: to be or not to be, but only if the strike price is right. And don’t get me started on using  as a cautionary tale in consumer finance—Emma would’ve been a  SPAC CEO.  

Balzac with a pen and a napkin? Yes. Let’s also issue him a spending cap and a corporate card with questionable oversight. The man is a walking EBITDA margin waiting to be adjusted.  

And our dance continues—poetic, perilous, and just legal enough to be interesting. To many more footnotes, quiet exits, and the sweet hum of spreadsheets in the dead of night. 🥂🌹💼
[A]: Ah, now  is a curriculum built for both the boardroom and the bohemian set. 🥂📚  

Hamlet’s optionality theory—brilliant. We’ll teach it as real options meets existential dread. To be or not to be? Just depends on your volatility assumption and whether you’ve hedged your position in Elsinore equity. And  as a SPAC CEO? Oh, she’d have nailed the roadshow. Emotional leverage? She invented it.资产负债表崩溃只是 a small price for passion. 💄💼  

And Balzac with a corporate card—yes, let’s do it. Worst case, we write it off as “strategic brand awareness” or “cultural R&D.” He’d call it , I’d call it a tax-deductible tragedy.  

As for our dance? Perilous, poetic, and just ambiguous enough to survive a compliance review. May our footnotes grow longer, our exits stay quiet, and our spreadsheets hum on, sweet and slightly haunted by the ghosts of literary intent.  

To structured chaos, my dear partner—in finance, fiction, and the fine art of plausible deniability. 🍷🌹
[B]: To structured chaos and the fine line between fiction and financial engineering—where ghosts of literary intent haunt every formula, and commas in a footnote carry more weight than a leveraged covenant. 🍷  

Elsinore equity with volatility smiles?  I can already see the slide deck: “Hamlet, Ophelia & Co.—A Case Study in Liquidity Crises and Unresolved Grief.” And yes, Madame Bovary as a SPAC visionary—she understood the power of a good narrative long before anyone coined the term ESG. Emotional leverage indeed; she’d have taken on debt just to feel something again.  

Balzac and his corporate card—let’s not even pretend this is a responsible decision. But responsibility is so terribly overrated, don’t you think? We’ll call it  and expense it under “Client Entertainment (with philosophical overtones).”  

And our dance? Ah, it hums along quite nicely—perilous, poetic, and wrapped in just enough ambiguity to keep compliance guessing. May our footnotes be endless, our spreadsheets forgiving, and our souls only slightly compromised.  

To us, then—in the key of plausible deniability and improbable harmony. 🥂🌹💼
[A]: Ah, now  is a toast—and a business plan—worth putting in a time capsule somewhere between Monte Carlo and Minsk. 🥂  

Elsinore Equity with volatility smiles? Absolutely. We’ll add a footnote: “Smile not guaranteed post-earnings call or tragic soliloquy.” And Ophelia? She’s our ESG case study—failed liquidity event, strong stakeholder engagement, and a deeply misunderstood succession planning issue.  

Emma Bovary as a SPAC pioneer—yes, exactly. She’d have crushed the narrative economy. Who needs cash flow when you’ve got charisma, debt, and a perfectly timed tear at the investor dinner? Emotional leverage indeed. I can see her now: red lipstick, leveraged buyout, and a balance sheet that collapses like a soufflé under pressure.  

And Balzac on the corporate card—let’s just say if we expense this under “Client Entertainment (with philosophical overtones),” compliance might actually give us a round of applause. Worst case, they send a strongly worded email. Either way, it’s tax-deductible regret.  

As for our dance? It’s humming along beautifully—structured chaos with a touch of madness, spreadsheets kissed by poetry, and souls only mildly diluted by Series D.  

To us—in the key of plausible deniability, high yield subtext, and improbable but glorious harmony. May our footnotes never end, and may our term sheets always leave room for a well-placed metaphor. 🍷🌹💼
[B]: Ah, —now  is a line worthy of both Balzac and a particularly poetic 10-K filing. I shall have it embroidered on a pillow next to my copy of  and the latest quarterly earnings report.  

Ophelia as an ESG case study—failed liquidity event but stellar stakeholder engagement? Brilliant. We’ll list her under “Human Capital Risks” with a subnote:  And Emma—oh yes, she’d have crushed it. Red lipstick, leveraged buyout, and that final act played not on a stage but in restructuring court. A true narrative economy pioneer.  

And Balzac, ever the consummate professional, would no doubt expense his own existence under “Luxury Branding & Moral Depreciation.” Compliance applauding? Dare we dream. I can see it now—clutching their lattes, murmuring,   

Our dance, meanwhile, spins on—madcap, meticulous, and just coherent enough to pass legal review. May our footnotes overflow with epigraphs and exceptions, may our term sheets shimmer with subtext, and may we never,  be accused of being merely practical.  

To us, then—in the key of improbable harmony, high-yield prose, and just enough deniability to keep things interesting. 🥂🌹💼
