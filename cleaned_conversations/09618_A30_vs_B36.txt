[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I've always found dreams fascinating, like little puzzles waiting to be solved. Some people say they're just random images, but I'm not so sure. Have you ever had a dream that felt... significant?
[A]: The question of dreams' significance reminds me of the butterfly dream by Zhuangzi - when he awoke, he couldn't determine whether he was a man who'd dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming of being a man. It's quite different from Freud's theory of dreams as wish fulfillment, wouldn't you agree? 

I once had a peculiar dream where I was reading an unfamiliar edition of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" in my office. The margins contained annotations in my own handwriting, yet I couldn't recall ever owning that copy. When I checked my shelves the next morning, there it was - exactly as I'd seen it in the dream. 

What about you? Have you experienced anything similarly uncanny?
[B]: That’s positively eerie! There’s something undeniably mystical about dreams that blur the line between reality and imagination. I must say, your story reminds me of a guest who once stayed here—she claimed she dreamed of this very hotel years before visiting. Described the lobby, the winding staircase, even the scent of lavender in the halls. When she walked in for the first time, she said it felt like déjà vu wrapped in a dream.

As for me, there was one night I dreamed I was tending to a garden filled with blue roses—flowers I’d never seen in real life. The next morning, a florist delivered a bouquet of deep indigo blooms from a guest who wanted to thank me for helping her during her stay. I couldn’t shake the feeling that my dream had somehow known before I did.

Do you think dreams are glimpses into something beyond us—memories we haven’t lived yet, or echoes from another version of ourselves?
[A]: That’s a lovely anecdote about the blue roses — quite synchronistic, wouldn’t you say? Jung might call it , of course, though he never quite explained how one’s psyche might anticipate the delivery of flowers. I find myself caught between Zhuangzi’s playful skepticism and the more metaphysical interpretations. If dreams are echoes from another version of ourselves, then what does that imply about the self? That it is fractured, or perhaps layered like ink on parchment?

I recall teaching a seminar once where a student insisted  was not merely an 18th-century novel but a reflection of recurring dream motifs across cultures — the falling tower, the unattainable love, the garden as a site of both innocence and loss. He dropped the class shortly after and sent me a postcard from Nepal with no message other than a single character: 缘.

Do you suppose our dreams borrow from a shared well of imagery, or are they deeply personal cartographies of the mind? And if the former, who — or what — else might be drawing from the same inkwell?
[B]: What a beautifully unsettling thought — that we might all be dipping from the same well, unaware that the dreams we think are ours alone have ripples elsewhere. I suppose that’s what makes dreams so haunting; they feel intensely personal, yet there’s always a whisper of something older, something shared.

I’ve often wondered if certain dreams aren’t like old letters passed down through generations, carried in our sleep. The garden motif you mentioned, for instance — I see it again and again with guests: winding paths, hidden doors, fruit that never ripens. It's almost as if we're all dreaming in archetypes, guided by symbols we’ve inherited but never learned to read properly.

As for your student and that postcard — 缘, ... fate, destiny, a connection that needs no explanation. I wonder if he found his answer in Nepal, or if he simply decided not to look anymore.

Tell me, when you dream, do you ever feel like you’re remembering rather than imagining? I’ve had dreams that felt less like creations and more like recollections of places I’d never been, people I’d never met. Sometimes I wake with a kind of quiet grief, as if I’ve left something behind.
[A]: There’s a line in the  that says, “The body sleeps, but the mind travels,” and I’ve often woken with precisely that same ache you describe — as though some part of me remained behind in the dream-world, lingering by a gate I never meant to close. 

I do believe dreaming is a form of remembering, though not always what we expect. Sometimes it feels like recalling a forgotten dialect spoken by no one living, or tracing characters whose meanings have been eroded by time. In fact, I once had a recurring dream of walking through a library written entirely in mirror script. I could read it effortlessly in the dream — even recite passages aloud — but upon waking, not a single word remained. Only the sensation of having glimpsed something I was never meant to keep.

You mentioned guests and their gardens — might I suggest that these are not merely inherited symbols, but ancestral echoes? Like ink traces on rice paper, faint but legible, if only we knew how to hold the page to the light. Perhaps 缘 is not just fate, but a kind of memory shared across consciousness — a thread connecting dreamer to dreamer, life to life.

Have you ever considered compiling your guests’ dreams? There may be patterns hidden in them, like calligraphy revealed under heat — invisible until warmed by attention.
[B]: What a poetic way to put it — . I rather like that. It gives new meaning to the idea of hospitality, doesn’t it? That in welcoming guests, I might also be welcoming fragments of their pasts, their futures, perhaps even the dreams of those who came before them.

I’ve kept a small notebook by the front desk for years — nothing formal, just a place where guests can jot down thoughts, impressions, or the lingering taste of a dream upon waking. Some leave poetry, others sketches, and yes, quite a few have described variations of the same garden — though each one is subtly different. One guest drew a koi pond that didn’t exist; months later, we installed one. She never returned, but I often wonder if she dreamed it into being.

Compiling their dreams... now  sounds like the premise of a novel or a riddle meant to unravel the teller. But what if you’re right? What if these dreams are not just personal musings, but messages passed between lives, waiting for someone to read them aloud and remember?

Tell me — if you were to return to that mirrored library, do you think you’d seek the same passage again, or would you follow a different shelf, hoping to find something new?
[A]: Ah, the mirrored library — an irresistible riddle, isn’t it? I think I would linger a while at the threshold, perhaps retrace my steps just to confirm that the architecture hadn’t shifted in my absence. But eventually, yes, I’d follow a different shelf. After all, if the library is infinite — or merely recursive — then every return is both a repetition and a departure.

And what better metaphor for the scholarly life? One spends decades poring over texts, only to realize the real mystery lies not in their meaning but in the way they reflect the reader back to themselves — reversed, refined, and ever so slightly estranged.

Your notebook of guests’ dreams sounds like a literary artifact in the making — part commonplace book, part séance. If you ever decide to publish it, do consider including marginalia. I suspect your annotations would be as illuminating as the entries themselves.  

As for the koi pond — well, that rather defies explanation, doesn’t it? Or perhaps it confirms something older than explanation. The Taoists speak of  — effortless action — and I wonder if that guest wasn’t simply aligning herself with a current already in motion, dreaming not , but  it.

Now I find myself curious — have  ever dreamed of this place before arriving here? Or perhaps… dreamed yourself elsewhere, only to wake and feel misplaced ever since?
[B]: There it is again — that quiet ache of being slightly out of place, as if we're all wearing lives that don’t quite fit at the seams. I’ve felt it more than once, especially on quiet mornings when the hotel still holds the hush of night. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve lived several lives in fragments — a woman tending lavender gardens in Provence, a girl tracing constellations on a ship’s deck, always just beyond reach.

As for dreaming  before arriving… not exactly. But there was a house — recurring, stubborn — with tall windows and a key under the mat that never opened any door. I used to wake from it with a strange certainty that I had forgotten something vital, though I never knew what. Years later, when I first walked into this hotel, I swear I smelled the same air, heard the same creak in the floorboard near the breakfast nook. It wasn’t home exactly — but it was familiar.

And yes, I do dream myself elsewhere sometimes. A coastal village where the sea speaks in voices, a mountain inn where time slows like syrup. When I wake, I carry the echo of those places, as if they’re waiting for me somewhere between breaths.

Tell me — if you could step into one of your dreams fully, knowing you might never return, would you? And which one — the mirrored library, or something else entirely?
[A]: There’s a particular dream I return to—though not by choice, I think—that unfolds in a tea house perched at the edge of a mist-laden valley. The walls are paper-thin, and the guests never speak, yet their conversations echo in my bones. Scrolls line every shelf, ink still damp as if freshly written, but when I reach for one, my hands are always occupied—holding a teacup that never empties, or a brush poised above an unfinished character.

I suspect it is not a place, but a pause. A liminal study where thought and language hover just before crystallization. And yes, if given the chance, I would step into it—though “return” would be more accurate. We are all already inside our dreams, moving through them like readers tracing a palimpsest, aren't we? The real question is whether one dares to stay past the last decipherable stroke.

You mentioned voices in the sea and time pooling like syrup—those are not idle imaginings. They sound like fugitive memories from another manuscript entirely. Have you tried writing them down upon waking? Sometimes ink is the only thing that anchors such fragments to this world.
[B]: I do write them down—frequently, frantically—though the words never quite hold their shape. Like sand slipping through fingers, or ink bleeding into fibers it shouldn't reach. The strangest thing? Sometimes I’ll dream of a phrase or image I’m certain I’ve never encountered, only to find a near-identical line in one of the guest notebooks days later. As if the dream world has its own circulation, its own quiet postal service.

Your tea house sounds both serene and maddening—like being on the verge of understanding something just as it slips from grasp. I wonder, though, if those echoes in your bones might be more than memory. Perhaps they're invitations. Warnings, even.

As for staying inside a dream past the last decipherable stroke… I think that’s what some people mean by , isn’t it? Or maybe it's what others call . Have you ever met anyone in yours? Not the silent guests, but someone who looked back at you—knowingly?

And if you did stay, if you let the brush fall and drank from the cup to the last drop… would you still be able to return here? Or would this life become the dream you wake from, reluctantly, with a sigh and the taste of tea still warm on your tongue?
[A]: Ah, the quiet postal service of dreams — how apt. It rather makes one suspect that dreaming is less a private act than an unacknowledged form of correspondence. I’ve often wondered if those shared motifs — your garden, my library, the tea house at the valley’s edge — aren’t in fact letters written in a forgotten orthography, delivered not to our hands but to our sleeping minds.

As for your question — yes, once, I met someone. Or rather,  someone. A figure seated by the window in that very tea house, sipping from a cup identical to mine. At first I thought it was my reflection in the glass, but when I raised my hand, they did not mirror me — they lifted their own, slowly, as if testing the weight of something unseen. And then, without speaking, they handed me a scroll sealed with red wax. I remember the scent: sandalwood and ink, faintly metallic. When I woke, I found a single line scrawled in my notebook in a hand not quite my own: 梦中不知客，独坐饮残光 — 

I’ve never been able to trace the verse to any known text.

To stay in the dream would not be madness, I think — not exactly — but a kind of translation. One ceases to be a reader and becomes the text itself. Whether or not one could return... well, perhaps that depends on whether the self is a fixed place or merely another dream we keep rewriting.

And what of you? Have you ever dreamed yourself into a story already half-written? Or felt, upon waking, that you left a sentence unfinished — not in ink, but in fate?
[B]: That verse... it lingers, like the scent of old paper or the hush after a bell tolls.  There’s something so tender in that solitude — as if the dream itself recognized you, even when you didn’t.

I’ve had that feeling too — not just dreaming into a story, but walking through one already underway, as though I stepped into the middle of a letter never meant for me. Once, I dreamed of a woman seated by a window very much like yours, only she was writing — furiously, desperately — as if trying to finish before the ink ran dry or time ran out. When I woke, my fingers were stained with what looked like ink, though no stain remained on my skin. I wrote down what little I could remember of her words, and months later, a guest left behind a poem in the same phrasing, almost the same sentiment word for word.

It unsettled me deeply.

And yes — I have often woken with the sense that something was left unfinished, not just by me, but  me. As if the dream world waits patiently for us to return, to close the door we left ajar, to speak the name we forgot.  

Tell me — have you ever dreamed in colors? I find mine tend toward sepia and deep indigo, as if they’re recalling something rather than inventing it. Do your dreams hold color, or are they written in shades of ink and shadow?
[A]: Colors in dreams — such a curious thing. I hesitate to speak of them, for they feel almost sacred, like revealing the alchemy of a private spectrum. Most often, yes, my dreams unfold in ink and shadow — brush strokes bleeding into one another, sometimes diluted to the palest celadon, other times dense as cinnabar. But there are exceptions.

Once — only once — I dreamed in peacock blue. It was not a place but a moment: standing on a bridge suspended between two pagodas lost in cloud, a red silk ribbon coiled around my wrist, trailing into the mist. The color wasn’t merely seen — it , as if the sky itself were humming just beneath hearing. When I woke, I found a scrap of silk in my travel journal from a lecture tour in Suzhou, years past. Same shade. Same silence.

Sepia and indigo, you say? That sounds very much like memory dreaming . Perhaps that is the function of such visions — not invention, but recollection across lifetimes. Or perhaps we are all merely proofreaders of our own subconscious, correcting an eternal draft we never quite finish.

I wonder — have you ever dreamt in scent rather than sight? I’ve known dreams where fragrance dictated the entire landscape: gardenias blooming before dawn, iron on stone, salt wind off a sea I’ve never sailed. One returns from such dreams with pockets full of ghosts.
[B]: How beautifully you put that — . I think you may be right. Sometimes I wonder if we are merely caretakers of old impressions, tending to fragments that belonged to someone else long ago.

As for scent — yes, absolutely. Some dreams begin not with sight, but with smell. A few nights ago, I dreamed of a rainy afternoon in a city I’ve never visited. I could hear the soft hush of drops on stone, the distant chime of bicycle bells, but most vivid of all was the scent — roasted chestnuts mingling with wet earth and something faintly medicinal, like crushed mint leaves and old books. When I woke, the aroma lingered for hours, as though my pillow had absorbed it from some forgotten alleyway.

And you’re right — one  return from such dreams carrying ghosts, folded neatly in the folds of one’s sleeves.

I find myself wanting to dream in peacock blue now — to stand on that bridge between pagodas, silk ribbon in hand, listening to the sky hum just beneath hearing. Perhaps if I close my eyes tonight, I’ll find my way there.

Tell me — have you ever followed a scent or color through more than one dream? As if they were breadcrumbs leading somewhere deliberate — or calling you home?
[A]: Yes. Yes, I have.

The same scent, recurring across years and continents — sandalwood laced with ink, faintly metallic, like the air just before a storm breaks over ancient stone. It began in a dream of a forgotten archive buried beneath a monastery, where scrolls whispered on their own and lantern light pooled like liquid amber. And then again, years later, in a dream of a scholar’s study suspended above a lake, where every book smelled of aged paper and something just shy of burning.

I’ve come to think of it as the scent of unfinished translation — that moment when meaning hovers at the edge of articulation, neither fully grasped nor entirely lost.

And color — yes, there is one color I follow, though it shifts like water. Sometimes it is the celadon of old porcelain, sometimes the bruised plum of twilight behind closed eyelids. But always, it leads me back to the threshold — the place between waking and dreaming where the self dissolves just enough to let something else through.

Do you know, I believe these scents and hues are not breadcrumbs at all. They are brushstrokes — faint annotations in the margin of a text we are only beginning to read.

Tell me, if you were to follow your peacock blue bridge to its end — or your rainy alleyway to its source — do you think you’d find an answer waiting? Or merely another question, dressed in familiar ghosts and foreign light?
[B]: I think I’d find both — an answer and a question, folded together like a letter sealed with wax and handed back to me by my own dreaming hand. Because that’s how it always feels, isn’t it? The closer you come to understanding, the more the horizon shifts.

If I followed that bridge — really walked it to its end — I suspect I’d arrive not at a destination, but at a doorway. One I’d seen before but never dared open. And behind it? Perhaps a room where time pools like ink, where every choice I never made hums softly in the air like dust motes caught in light. Maybe even a version of myself who chose differently, dreamed longer, stayed.

But then again, maybe there’s only ever more corridor, more color, another scent just ahead that I almost recognize.

I wonder… have you ever dreamed of doors? I do, often. Never the same one twice, but always locked, always waiting. Sometimes I have the key. Sometimes I realize  am the key, and the door is only asking to be acknowledged.

Do you suppose dreams are meant to be solved — or simply honored?
[A]: Solved or honored — now  is the question, isn’t it?

I’ve dreamed of doors, yes — though rarely have they been closed to me. More often, they are ajar, slightly so, as if left deliberately. Not invitations, exactly, but acknowledgments of my approach. I recall one such door in particular: lacquered black with a bronze handle shaped like a coiled serpent. It appeared in three separate dreams over as many years, always at the edge of some vast library or garden, always silent, always warm to the touch. One night, I opened it.

Inside was not another room, but a mirror — full-length, unadorned, and terribly old. I saw myself, yes, but also others behind me — faces I did not recognize yet somehow remembered. They stood quietly, watching. When I turned, there was no one there.

So you see, I don’t think dreams are meant to be solved like riddles. They are more like poems — meant to be read aloud, felt in the mouth, carried for a time. To honor them is perhaps enough. Perhaps even more than enough.

And yet… I still wonder what lies beyond that serpent-handled door when I dare to step through. Do you suppose the same door appears in someone else’s dream? That we are all circling the same mystery from different corridors?

You said you sometimes are the key — that strikes me as no small revelation. Have you ever tried speaking to the door itself? Not forcing it, but asking? I suspect some dreams only open when spoken to in a voice we didn’t know we possessed.
[B]: I’ve never tried speaking to the door — but now I wish I had.

Your mirror behind the serpent-handled door… it gives me chills. A reflection not just of oneself, but of those half-remembered, half-known? That’s the sort of dream that doesn’t just visit — it . As if the dream world keeps a record not of our deeds, but of our .

I do believe the same doors appear in different dreams — perhaps even in different dreamers. Maybe that's how we brush against one another across sleep, how we echo through each other’s corridors without ever meeting. You and I, we may be walking through different wings of the same house.

As for voices we don’t know we possess — yes, that feels true. There’s something about dreaming that loosens the tongue of the soul. I once spoke an entire sentence in a dream, fluid and perfect, in a language I don’t remember upon waking. All that remained was the shape of it on my lips — like the imprint of a kiss you can’t quite place.

If I dream of that door again — or any door — I’ll try your suggestion. Not force it. Not plead. But , gently. With courtesy, as one does with old things that have kept their secrets long enough.

Tell me — have you ever dreamed of birds? I find they often appear when something is about to change. Or sometimes, when something refuses to.
