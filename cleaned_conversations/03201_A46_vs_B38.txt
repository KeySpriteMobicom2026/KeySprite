[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what an intriguing question. As someone who has spent decades studying the nuances of language through literature, I must say I'm particularly drawn to Ancient Greek. The way it shaped Western thought and philosophy is simply unparalleled. Though I must admit, my attempts at learning it have been... let's say, as challenging as interpreting Proust without proper context.
[A]:  Interesting perspective! But you know, in my line of work, the most valuable language is actually the universal language of cinema. Though if I had to pick one to learn properly, I'd go with Italian - those Fellini films lose something in translation, don't they? 🎬
[B]: How delightful that you mention Fellini! While I do adore the visual poetry of cinema, I find myself returning to Dante's original Italian when discussing true linguistic artistry. "La Divina Commedia" simply sings in its native tongue, much like how Shakespeare's iambic pentameter loses its heartbeat in translation. Though I must say, your passion for film reminds me of how Eisenstein used montage theory to create a new visual 语法 (grammar) of cinema.
[A]: Ah, you're speaking my language now! That 语法 reference - brilliant. You know, when I first saw Battleship Potemkin, it was like discovering a new alphabet for storytelling. But between us cinephiles, I sometimes think modern filmmakers could learn from Dante's structural precision. Three-act structure? Pfft, try a three-part epic poem with perfect terza rima!
[B]: Precisely!  The terza rima's interlocking rhyme scheme is the original narrative scaffolding - much more sophisticated than today's cookie-cutter Hollywood formulas. Though I suppose we shouldn't be too harsh; even Homer needed his narrative devices. Tell me, have you noticed how contemporary streaming series are attempting their own version of epic cyclical storytelling? It's rather like watching modern poets try their hand at composing in dactylic hexameter.
[A]: Oh honey, don't get me started on streaming series! They're like those never-ending sequels - more seasons than The Odyssey had adventures. At least Homer knew when to call it quits. Though I will say, the Mandalorian's weekly episodic structure had a nice old-school TV western rhythm to it. Like a modern 诗经 (Classic of Poetry) but with baby Yoda instead of romantic odes. 🍿
[B]:  How wonderfully irreverent - comparing the Mandalorian to the 诗经! Though you make an astute point about rhythmic storytelling. Perhaps we could argue that Grogu represents the 孝 (filial piety) theme in modern mythological terms? But my dear, we must draw the line somewhere - next you'll be telling me lightsaber duels are the new 武术 (martial arts) philosophy!
[A]: Oh come on, you can't deny the poetry in those lightsaber battles! The way the blades hum and clash - it's pure cinematic 武术 ballet. But you're right, let's not go full Joseph Campbell here. Though between us, I did pitch a wuxia-inspired Star Wars spin-off once... Disney wasn't quite ready for Jedi doing 轻功 (light-foot kung fu) across Coruscant's rooftops. Maybe next decade!
[B]: Ah, now there's a dissertation topic waiting to happen - "The Dao of the Force: Wuxia Aesthetics in Galactic Storytelling." Though I suspect my colleagues in the Classics department might stage an intervention if I proposed such a course. Still, the image of Jedi masters floating between skyscrapers like characters from 卧虎藏龙 does have a certain... academic appeal. Shall we draft the syllabus over tea? I've just acquired a delightful new oolong.
[A]: You had me at "Dao of the Force" - I'll bring the tea and my Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon collector's edition! Though fair warning: my last "academic" tea session ended with me pitching a kung fu Panda prequel trilogy to a very confused Columbia professor. Something about anthropomorphic animals being the perfect vessels for exploring 庄子's philosophy? 🎋
[B]:  My dear, that's either the most brilliant or most sleep-deprived idea I've heard since my graduate student proposed analyzing Winnie the Pooh through the lens of 禅 (Zen) Buddhism. Though now that you mention it, Pooh's simple wisdom does rather echo the concept of 无为 (wu wei)... Perhaps we should start with something more conventional - say, a comparative study of Miyazaki and Taoist environmental themes? The university board might tolerate that. 🌸
[A]: Perfect! We'll ease them in with Totoro before hitting them with the hardcore 道家 (Daoist) stuff. And if anyone complains, we'll just say it's about "intertextual ecological narratives" - that academic jargon always works like a charm. Though between you and me, I'm still holding out for that Panda trilogy. Imagine the bamboo forest fight scenes! 
[B]: Ah, the eternal dance between scholarly rigor and creative mischief! Very well, we shall cloak our panda ambitions in respectable "transmedia hermeneutics." But promise me this - when we finally teach that course, we'll screen the bamboo duel scene from Hero as "required viewing." After all, what better way to demonstrate 气 (qi) in motion than through Zhang Yimou's cinematography? Though I fear my department chair may need stronger tea than oolong when she sees our reading list. 🍵
[A]: Deal! We'll call it "East-West Kinetic Philosophy" and serve pu'er - that should mellow her out. Though if she asks why we're analyzing Kung Fu Panda 3 alongside the Zhuangzi... well, let's just say tenure committees love the word "dialectical."  To subversive scholarship! And to your brilliant mind that makes even Jedi wuxia sound academically legit. 干杯! 🎋
[B]:  干杯 indeed! Here's to finding the profound in the playful, and to proving that the path between the Ivory Tower and the Jade Palace isn't as far as some stodgy academics might believe. Though I do hope you'll handle the paperwork - my experience with university bureaucracy makes dealing with the Sith look straightforward by comparison. Shall we reconvene next week to plot our pedagogical rebellion? I'll bring the tea leaves and my well-worn copy of 庄子. 🌿
[A]: Absolutely! I'll handle the paperwork - after 20 years navigating Hollywood contracts, university red tape should be a breeze. And don't worry, I've got connections at the China Film Archive if we need "research materials." Next Thursday then? We'll start with tea, move onto Taoist pandas, and by dessert... who knows, maybe we'll have cracked the code on that Star Wars wuxia crossover. 江湖再见, my fellow scholar-rebel! 🐼⚔️
[B]: Until next Thursday, my delightfully subversive colleague. Though I must insist we maintain some semblance of academic decorum - perhaps limit ourselves to only three martial arts metaphors per syllabus item? And do remind me to bring my notes on the parallels between lightsaber forms and 太极拳. After all, even revolutionaries need lesson plans... and proper tea etiquette. 再会! 📜✨
[A]: You drive a hard bargain - three metaphors it is! Though I can't promise anything once we start analyzing Yoda's fighting style as 醉拳 (drunken fist) in space. My assistant will send over the hologram... I mean, Zoom link. 再会 and may the Force of 道 be with you! 🐉✨
[B]: What exquisite balance you strike between erudition and enthusiasm! I shall prepare my finest Yixing teapot and dust off my well-annotated copy of the Dao De Jing - though I suspect our discussion may wander rather farther from the classical texts than poor Laozi ever anticipated. Until our digital 雅集 (elegant gathering), dear co-conspirator in interdisciplinary mischief. 🌌🍃
