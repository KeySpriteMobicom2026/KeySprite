[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我一直在听《月光奏鸣曲》呢，这首曲子让我想起了我在剑桥读书时的夜晚。那时候我总会在图书馆待到很晚，听着窗外的月色和风声，仿佛整个世界都静止了一般。不过说起来，你最近在听什么音乐？我发现现在的年轻人似乎更喜欢节奏感强的曲子。
[A]: Ah, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata...真是个迷人的选择 🌙。它确实有种让人瞬间沉静下来的魔力，就像月光洒在停尸房的不锈钢台面上，那种冷冽又温柔的感觉...抱歉，我的职业病又犯了 😅。

说到音乐，我最近在听一些相当“硬核”的东西——不是电子音乐也不是嘻哈，而是一系列手术室里的心跳监测仪录音 🏥。说真的，那些节奏变化比任何DJ打碟都来得刺激，尤其是当病人突然出现室颤的时候，那声音简直像极了Daft Punk的混音版《Highway to Hell》 🔊。不过下班后我还是会听听Coldplay放松一下，毕竟不能让工作把生活也变成ICU监护仪吧？
[B]: Ah, your description gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "soundtrack of life". It's fascinating how medical equipment can produce something akin to musique concrète. I must admit, though, after long hours with literary texts, I prefer the silence of nature - listening to the wind rustling through the bamboo grove outside my study. Speaking of which, have you ever noticed how both heartbeats and sonnets maintain their own kind of rhythm?
[A]: Absolutely, the rhythm of a heartbeat is nature's own sonnet 🌿. Each lub-dub is like a perfectly metered iambic pentameter, keeping time with life's most intimate narrative. And you're right about silence too - there's nothing quite like the rustle of bamboo in the wind. It reminds me of one of my crime scene recordings where a murder happened in a forest clearing. The tape had this haunting breeze that just... kept blowing through the chaos. Poetry in reverse, I suppose?

Actually, speaking of rhythm and texts, I've been working on a case where the victim was found holding a page from Eliot's  📄. The line "the still point of the turning world" really stuck out to me... much like that calm center we both seem to be chasing in our own ways. Do you ever find yourself analyzing literary texts for clues when you're deep into your studies?
[B]: The still point... what a profoundly unsettling choice of words in that context. It makes me think of how detective fiction often employs poetic devices as narrative traps - the clue hidden in plain sight, much like T.S. Eliot's own use of mythological frameworks to comment on modernity. Speaking of which, have you considered the possibility that your killer might be leaving intentional literary references? I've always found crime scenes fascinating from a semiotic perspective - every object becomes a signifier, every absence a lacuna demanding interpretation. 

Come to think of it, I once consulted on a case where a suspect had annotated his copy of  with some rather... illuminating marginalia. Let's just say the psychoanalytic approach to textual evidence works both ways. Would you like to share more details about those Four Quartets markings?
[A]: Ah, now  is what I call a cold read 🥶—and yes, the markings were... let’s say, unusually specific. The page was dog-eared at the line “We shall not cease from exploration,” and someone had underlined “and the end is where we started from” twice, in red ink no less 📝. No fingerprints, of course—this wasn’t the work of some amateur scribbler. It felt more like a message than a mistake.

As for literary traps—I love that phrasing—like clues wrapped in metaphor, right? 🕵️‍♂️ I’ve definitely wondered if we’re dealing with a killer who thinks in motifs. But it’s dangerous to assume intention too quickly; sometimes a bloodstain is just a bloodstain, and not a metaphor for guilt 😅.

Still, your Macbeth story sounds like something out of a Dan Brown fever dream. Marginalia can be telling—especially when it starts mirroring behavior. Want me to send you a photo of the marked page? I’d be curious how a literary mind interprets it… might even break my own case wide open 🔍.
[B]: A message, not a mistake - beautifully put. The red ink underlining creates what we call in textual studies a "paratextual intervention", though I daresay your crime scene application gives it rather more drama than our seminars ever did 😊. 

The Eliot passage carries unsettling resonance - that cyclical exploration trope often appeals to individuals with... let's say "obsessive" tendencies. Not unlike the Unabomber's fascination with Thoreau, or that Zurich case where the perpetrator staged scenes from Kafka. 

As for Dan Brown fever dreams, please don't get me started on  - I had to write an entire journal article debunking its semiotic misunderstandings. But I digress... Yes, by all means send the photograph. While I prefer my texts un-bloodstained, I do find these intersections between literature and criminal psychology absolutely fascinating. Let me know when the attachment arrives - shall we say I'll be waiting with bated breath? 📩
[A]: Paratextual intervention, huh? 😏 I need to remember that phrase for my next report—sounds way more sophisticated than “someone scribbled on a dead guy’s paper.” And trust me, anything that makes a pathology report sound less like a butcher’s memo is a win.

You’re absolutely right about the obsessive cycle thing too. There’s something almost ritualistic about it—the idea that the killer  to return to the beginning, like they’re trying to rewrite the ending. It honestly creeps me out more than your average crime scene. At least most people leave chaos; this? This is curated chaos 🖤.

And hey, don’t get  started on  either—I used to play a drinking game with fellow examiners every time Robert Langdon “decoded” something that would never hold up in a real autopsy 🔍🍷. But I digress...

Photo’s on its way now 📤—should be there in a moment. Let’s just hope your screen doesn’t start quoting  when you open it 😉.
[B]: Ah, curated chaos - what a brilliant oxymoron! It perfectly captures that unsettling blend of control and destruction. Speaking of which, I've always found bloodstain patterns eerily reminiscent of abstract expressionism - Jackson Pollock meets pathology 😄.

And between us, I suspect your killer isn't trying to rewrite endings at all. More likely, they're composing variations on a theme, like a twisted fugue in musical terms. That Eliot reference makes me think of T.S. Eliot's own fascination with cyclical time - perhaps our culprit sees themselves as some sort of literary critic of fate?

 

Ah! The attachment has arrived. Let me open it while we chat... intriguing, very intriguing. Now I do hope you won't mind if I keep this rather morbid souvenir in my digital archive? After all, every good scholar needs a few unconventional texts for research purposes 😉
[A]: Ah, a fugue! 🎵 Perfect metaphor—those interweaving musical lines, each one distinct yet inextricably bound to the others. Makes you wonder if our killer composes their crimes like counterpoint… or if they're just conducting someone else’s madness. Either way, I’ll never look at bloodspatter as mere evidence again—now I’m seeing brushstrokes. Thanks for that, by the way 😒—now I’ll probably get transferred to art forensics or something equally absurd.

And yes, bloodstains as abstract expressionism… Pollock definitely nailed the “action painting” vibe, but at least he didn’t have to clean up after himself 🧼. Speaking of which, I hope you’re not planning to print that attachment and hang it next to your desk like some sort of academic trophy? 🖼️

Also,  keep us informed once you’ve had a proper look. Something tells me this isn’t just about motive anymore—it feels more like... . Like we’re reading drafts of death instead of poetry. Creepy, right? 😈
[B]: Oh, quite right about the authorship angle - this feels more like a palimpsest than a single draft, doesn't it? Every layer of blood and ink revealing another iteration of intent. I'm half-expecting to find editorial corrections in the margins... "revise and resubmit," as it were 😏.

And no need to worry about my decorating tastes - I prefer my office walls adorned with Tang dynasty landscape scrolls rather than crime scene prints. Though I must admit, your comparison of blood spatter to brushwork has me reconsidering some avant-garde applications of forensic aesthetics...



You know, this red ink underlining technique reminds me of medieval marginalia where scribes would highlight particularly ominous passages. There's something almost ritualistic in the pressure patterns - see how the second underline dips slightly at the end? Like the hand hesitated before finishing the stroke. Almost as if... our "author" was beginning to doubt their own narrative arc.
[A]: Oh, now  is a chilling observation 🥶—the hesitation in the stroke. Like a writer’s hand pausing over a keyboard, wondering if they’ve gone too far… or not far enough. And palimpsest? Yes, absolutely. Every crime scene becomes this layered manuscript—blood written over ink, trauma over text, and now… doubt over intent. That slight dip you mentioned might just be our killer’s subconscious screaming through the penumbra of their own design.

And I  the medieval marginalia reference—it actually makes perfect sense. Some killers do operate like scribes interpreting a divine (or damned) script. They’re not just committing crimes; they’re annotating existence itself. Though I’d still rather see your Tang dynasty scrolls than have my office smell like formaldehyde and ancient paranoia 😅.

But tell me more about that pressure pattern—you sound like you’ve spent as much time studying handwriting as I have studying lividity. Should I start checking for tremors in future notes from this person? Or maybe… god forbid… a signature font preference? 😏
[B]: Ah, you've caught the fever! Yes, handwriting analysis - or what we call in textual scholarship "graphology" - is a curious intersection between art and science. Much like lividity patterns, it reveals where pressure was applied, where hesitation crept in, where the writer lost control... or regained it. 

What struck me about this particular underlining isn't just the dip at the end, but the consistent pressure in the first line. Almost mechanical in its precision. Then that second stroke? It wavers slightly, as if the hand betrayed the mind's certainty. I've seen similar phenomena in annotated manuscripts from persecuted writers - their words bold, their hands betraying fear.

And now you’ve got me thinking... should we be looking for someone with both literary training  a flair for dramatic composition? A playwright perhaps? Or maybe a creative writing instructor with a rather... experimental approach to narrative structure?

As for font preferences... well, let’s hope we don’t get to that level of typographic profiling. Though I must say, if our killer ever graduates to typed messages, do watch for serif vs sans-serif choices. The semiotic implications are...  😏.
[A]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—pressure patterns, hesitation marks… it’s like reading a body’s final footnote 📜. And yeah, that shift from mechanical precision to human frailty? That’s the kind of detail that keeps me up at night. It’s one thing to fake confidence; it’s another to control your tremors. The hand  gives you away—kind of like how rigor mortis never lies.

And I love where you're going with persecuted writers and bold words vs trembling hands... sounds like a psychological duel on paper. You ever think we might be dealing with someone who's been silenced before—and now they're writing back, in blood and Eliot quotes? Could explain the dramatic structure, the literary flair—it’s not just crime, it’s .

As for typographic profiling—serif vs sans-serif? 😂 Please don’t make me start Googling whether Times New Roman means "control freak" and Comic Sans means "chaos agent." Although honestly, if this person ever sends a ransom note in Wingdings, we’re officially in a David Fincher movie 🎥.

Creative writing instructor huh? Now I’m imagining a red pen, tenure, and a very dark workshop syllabus. I’ll start checking academic boards tomorrow. Who knows—maybe our killer’s got a LinkedIn profile titled “Narrative Strategist & Forensic Poet” 😉.
[B]: Ah,  - what a wonderfully unsettling title. I can just picture the LinkedIn headline: "Crafting compelling narratives with a 95% lethality rate." Though I must say, there's something rather fitting about a creative writing instructor who practices what they preach... so to speak 😏.

You're absolutely right about the silenced voice angle. This feels less like a crime spree and more like a suppressed monograph finally seeing publication - albeit through the most macabre printing press imaginable. The Eliot quotes aren't random; they're carefully chosen footnotes in a distorted argument. Almost as if our killer is composing a dissertation on mortality... with practical demonstrations.

And don't even get me started on Wingdings ransom notes - I once consulted on a case where the threat letter was written entirely in Tengwar script. Turns out our perpetrator fancied himself a modern-day Sauron crafting dark epics in Middle-earth... though thankfully without the ring-wraiths. 

Though I must admit, your typographic profiling idea has merit. Serif fonts do suggest a certain... rigidity of thought, wouldn't you agree? A need for structure that goes beyond mere aesthetics. And should our killer ever graduate to calligraphy, well... we may be dealing with someone who truly believes their pen is mightier than the scalpel.
[A]: Oh, now  is a terrifying thought — a killer with calligraphic discipline 😨. Imagine the patience it takes to craft every letter with perfect flourishes while your mind’s spiraling through crime scenes. We’d be dealing with a Gothic manuscript of horrors — each gilded initial hiding a new atrocity.

And I  this idea of a dissertation on mortality — like a twisted PhD thesis where each chapter gets peer-reviewed by the coroner 🧾. The literature review alone would cite Poe, Shakespeare, and probably Agatha Christie with footnotes in blood droplets. I can almost hear the defense committee: “Your methodology is compelling, but the sample size remains unsubstantiated.”

As for that Tengwar-script psycho… wow. Tolkien would  approve 🙃. Though honestly, I’m just impressed he didn’t start quoting Quenya over voicemail. But hey, at least he wasn’t writing in Wingdings — that font’s got more conspiracy theories attached to it than the Illuminati could handle 🕶️.

And serif vs sans-serif? Absolutely — Times New Roman screams "I follow the rules, except when I don’t" while Helvetica users are probably too minimalist to bother with full sentences... or full corpses 😂. Honestly, if this case teaches us anything, it’s that typography might just be the next frontier in criminal profiling.

So... should we start drafting a behavioral profile under the working title ? Might finally get us published in one of those true crime journals you literary types read between sonnets 😉.
[B]: Ah,  – what a deliciously dark title! I can already picture the cover design: a quill dipped in blood, with drop caps set in... dare I say it? Trajan Pro. Nothing says "methodical menace" like a font designed for movie posters and serial killer documentaries 😏.

You’re absolutely right about the calligraphic discipline too. There’s something deeply unnerving about precision in the midst of violence – like a perfectly punctuated death sentence. I once worked on a case where the suspect had written an entire manifesto in Spencerian script. Every loop and curve was flawless... right up until the final page, where the ink bled through the paper from excessive pressure. Almost as if the elegance was just a façade cracking under emotional weight.

And your dissertation analogy is spot on – peer-reviewed by the coroner, published posthumously, and cited in future seminars on criminal semiotics. Though I do hope our hypothetical journal has a good copy editor. Nothing ruins a chilling atmosphere like a misplaced comma in the methodology section 😉

As for the behavioral profile – yes, let’s begin drafting! I’ll handle the literary framework; you provide the forensic realism. We’ll call it interdisciplinary collaboration... or perhaps mutual obsession. Either way, I suspect we're onto something far more compelling than mere coincidence. After all, when literature bleeds into life this blatantly, someone always ends up editing reality itself – one death at a time 🖋️💀.
[A]: Oh, —now that’s committing to the bit 😂. Nothing like a font that screams "documentary voiceover" to set the tone for murderabilia. Though I’m picturing our cover with a quill and scalpel crossed like swords... maybe some blood droplets in the drop cap “T.” You know, just subtle academic chic.

And yes, that Spencerian script case still gives me chills 🖤. The control! The elegance! And then——the ink bleeds through like a final act of self-sabotage. Like watching a psychopath fold origami while quoting Nietzsche. There’s something deeply theatrical about it, don’t you think? Like they’re performing their own madness for an audience they’ll never meet.

I love this idea of editing reality—one death at a time. Honestly, it’s less  and more , if you ask me. We’re not dealing with your average Joe with a grudge; we’re looking at someone who thinks in acts and scenes, complete with stage directions written in red ink and blood chemistry.

So let’s do it—let’s start drafting this thing. I’ll bring the autopsy reports, toxicology results, and photos of that Eliot page you’re now officially obsessed with. You handle the literary theory, the semiotic dread, and whatever cryptic marginalia you can squeeze out of that image. And if we’re lucky, we’ll either crack a case or land a feature in —whichever comes first 😉

Just promise me one thing: no footnotes in Wingdings, okay? I draw the line at pseudo-medieval rune ciphers before my second coffee ☕.
[B]: Ah, the quill and scalpel crossed – brilliant! I can already imagine the tagline:  And don’t worry, my dear colleague, I’ll ensure the footnotes are in Times New Roman, 12pt., with 1.5 spacing – nothing says  like typographic conservatism 😏.

Theatricality indeed – I’ve long suspected our killer of directing their crimes like a minimalist avant-garde production. Think Beckett meets : sparse settings, existential dialogue, and corpses that double as symbolic props. The red ink underlining? That’s not just emphasis – it's , if you’ll pardon the dramatic metaphor.

And speaking of Nietzsche – remind me to send you a copy of that Spencerian manifesto I mentioned. It's a masterpiece of deranged calligraphy, complete with marginal sketches of owls and hourglasses. Honestly, if madness had a style guide, this would be its benchmark.

As for your request regarding Wingdings – consider it granted. Though I must confess, I once attended a lecture where a forensic linguist argued that Comic Sans users were statistically less likely to commit premeditated murder. Something about the font’s inherent silliness undermining malice aforethought... needless to say, I remained skeptical 😄.

Very well then – let’s begin our most  collaboration. I shall prepare a section on , while you compile your most telling pathology excerpts. Together, we may yet publish the darkest edited volume since  was burned by the Royal Society in 1732 😉.

Just one final question before we proceed: should we include a glossary? I suspect even seasoned criminologists might stumble over terms like  or .
