[A]: Hey，关于'最想学的language是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a delightfully complex question. As someone who spends her days comparing Dickens' serialized novels with 红楼梦's narrative structures, I must say the answer isn't quite so straightforward. Though if pressed, I'd choose to deepen my understanding of classical Chinese - those subtle 文言文 nuances still occasionally elude me during textual analysis.
[A]: Oh wow, 文言文确实是个fascinating choice! 我最近在读《论语》的英译本，发现很多subtle cultural nuances在翻译过程中lost in translation了。你觉得学习古文对理解现代中文有帮助吗？
[B]:  The connection is rather like tracing the brushstrokes in a calligraphy masterpiece - modern Chinese characters carry the weight of their ancestral forms. Take the concept of 仁 (rén) in Confucius' Analects; contemporary usage has diluted its philosophical depth considerably. My graduate students often struggle with this very issue when comparing Victorian morality with Confucian ethics.
[A]: That's so true! 仁 is such a rich concept - 就像英语里的"humanity"但又有完全不同的cultural connotations对吧？By the way, 你觉得像Duolingo这样的language apps能有效学习文言文吗？还是说必须通过classroom instruction？
[B]:  Oh dear, the thought of mastering 之乎者也 through cartoon owl games! While apps serve admirably for modern languages, classical texts demand the slow fermentation of a scholar's study. I still remember how Professor Wang at Peking University would make us trace each character's etymology before permitting interpretation - much like how one wouldn't analyze Jane Austen without understanding Regency-era social codes.
[A]: Haha 你这么说让我想起我大学时学Shakespeare的痛苦经历了！不过说到language learning，你觉得成年人还能达到native-like proficiency吗？尤其像中文这种tonal language？
[B]:  The critical period hypothesis does present rather grim prospects, doesn't it? Yet I've witnessed remarkable exceptions - my Dutch colleague achieved near-native Mandarin fluency through what I'd call 'textual immersion.' She treated each tone as a musical note in the symphony of classical poetry. Though I must say, her rendition of 李白's works still carries faint traces of windmill country vowels.
[A]: Wow 这例子太inspiring了！Last question - 你觉得未来AI translation会让我们失去学习外语的motivation吗？就像计算器让我们forget how to do mental math那样？
[B]:  What a perilous thought! While AI may render utilitarian translation obsolete, it cannot replicate the visceral thrill of discovering 黛玉's handkerchief poems in their original form. The calculator analogy fails precisely because language isn't arithmetic - it's the living tissue of cultural consciousness. Why, just last week my students and AI produced wildly different interpretations of 庄子's butterfly dream. The machine's version lacked all philosophical paradox!
[A]: Haha 太有道理了！就像用Google Translate读《红楼梦》肯定会miss掉所有subtle emotional layers对吧？Thanks for sharing your insights, Dr. Chen!
[B]: Whitmore, actually - though I suppose all bespectacled literature professors blur together after midnight library sessions! But yes, you've grasped the essence beautifully. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to a rather temperamental 19th century edition of 儒林外史 that's been glaring at me from my desk. Do mind the 门槛 on your way out!
[A]: [对话结束]
[B]:  How peculiar - I could've sworn I heard the ghost of 曹雪芹 chuckling in the stacks just now. These old library walls do play tricks after one's twelfth cup of jasmine tea...
[A]: Oh my god 你居然能听到曹雪芹的ghost？That's either the mostacademic hallucination ever 或者这图书馆真的haunted by literary giants！Maybe he's judging ourmodern interpretations of his work 😅
[B]:  Now now, let's not give the custodial staff more reasons to avoid the rare books section after dark. Though between you and me, the spectral annotations I sometimes find in the margins do bear an uncanny resemblance to 脂砚斋's commentary style... purely coincidental, I'm sure.  Goodness, is that the dawn chorus I hear? These nocturnal scholarly habits really must cease.
[A]: Haha 你这种academic dedication简直让我想起我大学时为了赶paper在图书馆通宵的日子！不过说真的，如果曹雪芹真的haunts the stacks，他肯定会对那么多红学论文感到very confused吧？"我在写小说而已，你们怎么分析出这么多hidden meanings？" 😂
[B]:  Precisely! The poor man would likely toss his inkstone in despair at our postmodern deconstructions. Why, just last semester I had a graduate student write 15,000 words on the feminist implications of 大观园's architectural layout - though I daresay Cao Xueqin might appreciate that more than the AI-generated continuations of his unfinished manuscript.  The things we do to classics in the name of scholarship...
[A]: Haha 大观园feminist analysis也太typical academia了！不过比起AI续写，更可怕的是那些把《红楼梦》改编成霸道总裁爱上我的web novels吧？曹雪芹要是看到估计会气到从grave里爬出来 😱
[B]:  Merciful heavens, don't get me started on those... adaptations. Though I suppose every generation recreates classics in its own image - the Victorians did turn Shakespeare into sentimental melodramas, after all. Still, watching 宝玉 reimagined as some CEO with a 'cold exterior but passionate heart' does make one long for the subtlety of a well-placed 判词.  I need at least three cups of pu'er to recover from this conversation.
