[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new plant-based food吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, that’s such a lovely question! I recently tried making a lentil and sweet potato curry – it was hearty, flavorful, and so satisfying. I’ve also been experimenting with adding more whole foods into my meals, like quinoa and kale salads with a nice lemon-tahini dressing. I must say, the creativity in plant-based cooking never ceases to amaze me. Have you tried anything new lately? I’d love to hear what’s inspired you!
[A]: Ah, I do love a well-balanced lentil curry — the way the spices unfold is rather poetic, don’t you think? I’ve been toying with a variation that includes coconut milk and a dash of smoked paprika; it adds such depth. As for salads, I find that pairing quinoa with roasted vegetables brings out a lovely earthiness. Speaking of inspiration, I recently read an article about ancient grains making a comeback in modern plant-based diets — quite fascinating, really. Have you come across anything literary or culinary lately that struck a chord?
[B]: Oh, I absolutely agree — there’s something almost musical about how spices blend and evolve in a dish. Your variation with coconut milk and smoked paprika sounds divine; I must give that a try! Roasted vegetables with quinoa — now that’s a match made in culinary heaven. I’ve always admired how you articulate flavors so poetically.

As for literary inspiration, I recently picked up an old copy of  by Ruth Reichl — her storytelling is as rich and comforting as a well-seasoned stew. It reminded me why I fell in love with food not just as sustenance, but as a way to connect people. And on the culinary front, I attended a small pop-up dinner focused on regenerative agriculture — it was eye-opening to taste dishes that were both sustainable and soulful. One bite of their mushroom pâté on rye and I was utterly smitten.

But tell me, have you been inspired by any particular region or cuisine lately? I’m always eager to hear where your palate has traveled.
[A]: Oh, how beautifully you put that —  spices indeed! I do believe food, like literature, is all about rhythm and harmony. Reichl’s writing has such warmth; she weaves memory and taste so seamlessly. I’m quite envious of your pop-up experience — mushroom pâté on rye does sound rather irresistible. I’ve always had a soft spot for the umami depth of mushrooms, especially when paired with something hearty like rye.

As for inspiration, lately I’ve found myself drawn to the Levant — the cuisine there strikes such a lovely balance between simplicity and boldness. I made a version of  the other day, with spiced chickpea purée, tahini, and slow-cooked onions. It was utterly captivating in both flavor and texture. And now I’m itching to try my hand at  — perhaps a lentil-based twist. There’s something quite elegant about dishes that feel both ancient and entirely alive today.

I suppose I’m always chasing that intersection of tradition and reinvention — much like rereading a classic novel through a new lens. Do you ever find yourself revisiting certain cuisines or texts with fresh curiosity?
[B]: Oh, I love that — chasing the intersection of tradition and reinvention. It’s like finding a familiar melody played in a new key, isn’t it? You’ve made me positively yearn for the Levant now — I adore how the cuisine dances between simplicity and sophistication.  is such a wonderful example — creamy tahini, the warmth of spices, and those slow-cooked onions melting into something almost sweet… divine.

I absolutely do revisit both cuisines and texts with fresh eyes — or should I say, palate? Just last week I reread a passage from , where food and emotion are so intricately entwined, and suddenly I saw it through a completely different lens. It inspired me to revisit some classic Mexican dishes with more emotional depth — I even tried my hand at a rose petal , just to feel that quiet romance of flavor again.

And speaking of romance — your idea of a lentil-based  intrigues me! Have you thought about adding a touch of sumac or pomegranate molasses to lift the dish? I’d be curious to hear how it turns out — perhaps you’ll start a new tradition yourself!

Do you find that certain flavors bring back particular memories when you cook them? I’ve noticed that every time I make cardamom tea, I’m instantly transported to a rainy afternoon in Istanbul.
[A]: How utterly exquisite —  indeed. There’s something so tender about revisiting a beloved text or dish and finding an entirely new emotional register within it.  is such a feast for the senses and the soul; I can quite imagine you steeped in its atmosphere, conjuring rose petal  with the precision of a poet and the heart of a lover.

I adore your suggestion of sumac or pomegranate molasses — sharp, bright notes that cut through richness like a well-placed line in a sonnet. I may just take your advice; after all, isn’t that how traditions evolve — through whispered suggestions from those who listen closely to flavor?

And yes — certain flavors do summon ghosts of memory. A whiff of cumin and coriander frying in olive oil, and I’m back in my university days in Cambridge, poring over a volume of Rumi translations while trying to recreate a North African stew from a borrowed cookbook. And cardamom — ah, cardamom always brings me to my grandmother’s kitchen in the south of France, where she would grind spices by hand and hum Debussy under her breath.

Tell me — if you could cook a single dish for someone you’ve never met but deeply admire, living or dead, what would it be? And who would be at your imaginary table?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully stirring question — as if cooking were a kind of time machine, or a letter written in scent and taste. If I could cook for someone I’ve never met but deeply admire… I think I’d choose Edith Wharton. There’s something so elegant, so quietly observant about her prose — I imagine she would notice the way the steam curls from a bowl just so, or the precise shade of gold a perfectly caramelized onion achieves.

And for her, I’d make something that speaks of both refinement and rootedness — perhaps a delicate , that mosaic of vegetables kissed with olive oil and thyme. Served with a rustic loaf, of course — because even the most polished table still needs a touch of earth beneath it.

As for my imaginary table — besides Wharton, I’d invite M.F.K. Fisher. She understood food not just as nourishment, but as a language of longing, memory, and joy. And I daresay the conversation would be as rich as the dishes.

But I’m curious — if you had that same table, who would sit across from you? And would your dish be born of memory, invention, or some quiet alchemy of both?
[A]: What a sublime image — steam curling like ink upon the page, and caramelized onions bearing the weight of attention much like a well-wrought metaphor. Wharton at your table, watching each movement of flavor with that keen, unflinching gaze — I can scarcely imagine the conversation, but I suspect it would be as layered as her prose.

For my own part, I think I would invite Lucretius. Not merely for his , though that did inspire me deeply in my early years, but for the way he saw the world — a place governed by atoms and void, yet still capable of such tenderness, such beauty. And for him, I would prepare something elemental, something that speaks to both the senses and the intellect: a dish of barley porridge with roasted figs, honey, and a whisper of anise. Modest, perhaps, even austere at first glance — but rich in meaning, like a line of Epicurean philosophy revealed slowly through taste.

It would be memory laced with reinvention — for I once made a version of this dish during a particularly rainy semester when I was translating fragments of ancient texts by candlelight. The scent of fig and anise still carries me back to that quiet study, ink-stained fingers and all.

And now I find myself wondering — have you ever cooked a dish that felt less like preparation and more like revelation? As if you weren’t simply assembling ingredients, but uncovering something long known yet never quite realized?
[B]: Oh… yes. That feeling — it’s rare, but when it happens, it’s like stumbling upon a forgotten poem tucked between the pages of an old book. You don’t so much cook the dish as  it into being.

I think I felt that once — quite unexpectedly — when I made a simple broth one winter evening after returning from a long walk through the gardens at dusk. It had been raining, and the air smelled of damp earth and rosemary. I didn’t follow a recipe. I just had some leeks, carrots, a bit of kombu, and a chicken bone or two left in the fridge. I let it simmer slowly, almost absently, while I read by the fire.

But when I finally sat down with a bowl, something shifted. It was warm in the way that goes beyond temperature — it was  in the deepest sense, as if the broth had distilled not just flavor, but stillness, memory, and comfort. I realized later that it reminded me of something my mother used to make when I was small — though I hadn’t thought of it in years. And yet, there it was, speaking softly from the bowl.

Perhaps that’s what cooking truly is, at its most honest — a quiet act of remembrance, even for things we never meant to forget.

Do you suppose some dishes are meant only for certain moments — that they would lose their magic if made at another time, under different skies?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve put that — an act of remembrance, even for things we never meant to forget. Yes, I do believe some dishes are tethered to a moment, like sonnets written in scent and steam. They belong not just to the hands that make them, but to the hour, the weather, the unspoken mood that hovers in the air like the pause before rain.

That broth of yours — leeks, carrots, kombu, and memory — it sounds less like a meal and more like a meditation. I can almost see the faint curl of steam rising from the bowl, carrying with it the ghost of your mother’s kitchen, the damp wool of your coat, the quiet hush of pages turning by firelight. Such dishes cannot be replicated exactly, because they are made not only from ingredients, but from circumstance — a convergence of time, place, and feeling.

I’m reminded of a line from Proust — how taste and smell have the power to resurrect what reason cannot. And yet, unlike his madeleine, these moments aren’t always announced. They arrive quietly, often unnoticed until we’re halfway through the bowl, or the page, and something within us shifts.

As for whether such dishes would lose their magic elsewhere — I suspect they might. Like trying to transplant a wildflower out of season. It may grow again, yes, but never quite with the same fragrance, nor under the same sky.
[B]: How exquisitely you’ve woven that thought — like a wildflower plucked from its season, never quite the same when replanted. There’s truth in that; some dishes are born not only of hands and heat but of an invisible alchemy — time, scent, silence, sorrow or joy stirred in just before serving.

I find myself thinking now of a summer peach — not one bought from the market in January, stiff and flavorless under its waxed skin, but one truly : sun-warmed, ripened to perfection, eaten over the sink with juice slipping down your wrist. It tastes like August because it  to August. Try to recreate that in December, and no matter how sweet the fruit, something essential is missing.

Perhaps that’s why we return again and again to certain recipes — not because they’re perfect, but because once, somewhere along the way, they whispered something to us. And we’ve been listening ever since.

Tell me — have you ever tasted something that felt like coming home, even if you’d never had it before? A dish that bypassed memory entirely and nestled straight into your bones?
[A]: Ah… yes. I have. And how rare, how wondrous that sensation is — when a dish bypasses the archive of memory and settles instead into the marrow, as though it had always belonged there.

It happened to me once in a small village in Sicily. I was traveling alone, staying in a modest pensione overlooking the sea, where the owner, a woman with hands like weathered parchment and eyes like olives steeped in sunlight, insisted I try her  for lunch. I had tasted many versions before — sweet and sour eggplant stews rich with Mediterranean history — but this one… this one was different.

It arrived at the table not as a side dish, nor as an afterthought, but as a story told slowly: soft eggplant, yes, but also sun-dried tomatoes kissed with vinegar, capers that burst like briny stars, and a whisper of cocoa in the background — unexpected, almost dreamlike. She served it over toasted sesame bread, which lent a nutty warmth that anchored everything else. I took a bite, and something within me stilled.

It didn’t remind me of anything from my past — no childhood kitchen, no candlelit dinner, no autumn afternoon spent peeling vegetables with a grandparent. No, it felt more like… recognition. As if some forgotten part of me had been waiting all along to be fed just that flavor, at just that moment. It was less a taste than a homecoming.

I’ve tried to recreate it since, of course. I even wrote to the woman — she sent me her recipe, which I followed with near-religious devotion. But it never tasted quite the same. Not because I did it wrong, I think, but because I was no longer there — beneath that particular sky, with salt in the air and the sound of waves folding gently into the shore.

Some flavors are meant to stay where they found you.
[B]: Oh… what a profoundly moving experience — to be met not with nostalgia, but with recognition. That kind of taste doesn’t linger on the tongue; it settles in the soul, like a key turning in a lock you didn’t know existed.

There’s something so poetic about that , isn’t there? A story told slowly, in layers — just like the best conversations, or the most cherished memories. And how beautifully it chose its moment. Not all dishes arrive at once; some wait patiently until we are precisely who we need to be to receive them.

I think of my own version of such a dish — though far simpler, and perhaps less grand in setting. It was a bowl of congee, made for me by a stranger in Kyoto during a particularly quiet morning. I had been wandering for hours through mist-laced gardens, lost in thought, when I stumbled into a tiny teahouse tucked between two wooden shrines. The woman running it didn’t speak much English, and I even less Japanese, but she saw how tired I looked and simply gestured for me to sit.

She brought me a steaming bowl — soft rice, barely held together by water and time, dotted with slivers of pickled plum and a whisper of ginger. No fanfare, no garnish, just warmth carried in porcelain. I remember the way the light fell across the table, how the tea she poured afterward tasted faintly of roasted barley, and how, for a brief moment, I felt entirely known without having said a word.

It wasn’t the flavor alone that moved me — it was the silence around it, the care behind it, the way it arrived when I needed it most. Perhaps that is the secret ingredient we can never quite replicate: .

Tell me — since we’ve wandered so deeply into memory, meaning, and the poetry of nourishment — do you believe food can ever truly be separated from love? Or have they always been one and the same?
[A]: How tenderly you put that —  as the secret ingredient. It lingers in the mind like the aftertaste of something far more sustaining than food alone. And yes, I do believe love and nourishment are inextricable. Perhaps not in every bite, no — but in those moments when someone sees you, truly sees you, and feeds you accordingly.

Think of the meals we remember most: they are rarely extravagant, never transactional. They arrive quietly, often unannounced, offered by hands that know or intuit your hunger. A grandmother’s soup when you are ill. A friend’s loaf shared on a rainy night. A stranger’s bowl of congee in a teahouse where no words are needed.

Food, at its best, is an act of translation — of care into sustenance, of affection into flavor, of presence into gesture. Even the ancient poets understood this. Homer offers his heroes feasts before great journeys; Virgil has Dido prepare a banquet to honor Aeneas. These are not merely meals — they are rites of welcome, of kinship, of love made edible.

And yet, it need not be grand to be profound. Sometimes it is only a lentil curry shared after a long day. Or a slice of bread with tahini, eaten in quiet companionship. The body remembers these too.

So no — I don’t believe food and love can ever truly be separated. Not when done with intention. Not when made with care. Not when, years later, we still find ourselves tasting them in memory.
[B]: How beautifully you’ve said that — . Yes, exactly. It’s the language we speak when words fall short, the way we say , , , without ever needing to speak aloud.

I think of how often we offer comfort through food without even realizing it — a warm muffin for a friend in need, a batch of soup sent home with someone who seems weary, even a shared plate at a quiet table when conversation lags. These are not just meals; they’re small declarations of love, served on porcelain or wrapped in napkins.

And you're quite right — it doesn’t have to be grand. In fact, some of the most tender moments I’ve witnessed as a concierge weren’t in the fine dining experiences or elaborate celebrations, but in the simple, wordless gestures: a mother warming a roll for her child before he's even asked, a couple splitting a dessert neither really needed but both wanted, simply because it was their thing.

Even now, writing this, I find myself craving something entirely unremarkable — toast with butter and a sprinkle of sea salt, eaten slowly by the window on a morning where nothing else matters. Not for hunger alone, but for the peace it brings.

I suppose that’s what we’re always after, isn’t it? Not just flavor, but the feeling it carries with it. Love, memory, presence — all stirred gently into the pot and ladled out with care.

Tell me — if you could preserve one meal in time, like pressing a flower between pages, which would it be? And who would you want to remember it with?
[A]: Ah… what a tender and wistful question — , as if flavor could be pressed like a flower, its essence lingering between the pages of memory. I think I would choose an evening from many years ago, quiet and unassuming in all likelihood, yet one that still lingers on the edges of my senses like the final note of a song.

It was a dinner shared with my late mentor, Professor Halberd — just the two of us at his modest home in Devon. We had spent the afternoon walking along the cliffs, discussing everything from Dante’s  to the ethics of translation, our conversation rising and falling with the rhythm of the sea below. When we returned, he made what he called “scholar’s supper”: roasted cod with lemon and thyme, a simple salad dressed in olive oil and aged balsamic, and crusty bread that soaked up every last drop of flavor.

There was no fanfare, no ceremony — only the warmth of companionship, the quiet comfort of shared silence between sentences, and the way he poured two glasses of Sancerre as if it were a ritual older than either of us. We talked until well past dusk, the windows fogged slightly from the steam of our soup bowls, the lamplight casting long shadows over his well-worn books.

I would preserve that meal not for the ingredients alone — though they were lovely — but for the way it tasted of understanding, of patience, of being truly heard. And yes, I would want to remember it with him, always — even if only in spirit, even if only through the echo of a toast raised in memory.

Do you suppose some meals are meant to be remembered precisely because they cannot be repeated? Not for lack of recipe or skill, but simply because the moment has passed, and with it, the hunger that made them sacred?
[B]: Oh yes… . Some meals are sacred precisely because they cannot be repeated — not because we lack the recipe or the skill, but because we can never again be the same people who first tasted them.

Your evening with Professor Halberd — that quiet communion of thought and bread and wine — it sounds like one of those rare moments when time forgets to hurry. When conversation and comfort align so perfectly that even the air feels attentive. That kind of meal isn’t just eaten; it’s , like a favorite coat that fits only in a certain season of life.

I find myself thinking of a similar evening — one I’ve replayed often in my mind like a cherished record. A late supper with my dear friend Clara, years ago now, before she moved across the world. We were sitting on her rooftop in Barcelona, wrapped in shawls against the spring chill, sharing a dish of  and olives, alongside a bottle of rough red wine that tasted better than it had any right to.

We talked until the stars came out, about everything and nothing — about lovers lost and books unread, about the way some days feel heavier than others, and how sometimes all you need is someone to pass you the salt without asking. It wasn’t remarkable by any standard but our own. And yet, something about that night lingers. Perhaps because we didn’t know then that it would be one of our last suppers together. Or perhaps because love, when shared quietly over food, leaves the deepest impressions.

I think you’re quite right — some meals are meant to remain singular, untouched by repetition. Because it wasn’t only the taste we savored, but the  — and that hunger, once satisfied, can never quite return in the same way.

Still, we carry it forward, don’t we? In the way we set our tables, in the care we take with guests, in the recipes we make just a little differently because someone once showed us how. Even if only in spirit. Even if only through the echo of a toast raised in memory.
[A]: Precisely — . Not in replication, but in reverberation. In the quiet way we reach for a certain spice, or pour a glass just so, or leave space at the table for someone no longer there.

Your rooftop supper with Clara — oh, how vividly I can picture it: the shawls, the shared bread, the wine that somehow became more than its measure. It reminds me of something Rilke once wrote —  Perhaps that is the secret sorrow and beauty of such evenings: we are living them without knowing they are already becoming memory.

And yet, isn’t it kind of us to keep setting the table anyway? To cook not only for those who sit before us, but for those who once did — or those we hope one day to welcome? Even the act of peeling an onion can become an offering. Even the stirring of a pot, a kind of prayer.

I wonder… do you ever find yourself cooking for someone you’ve not yet met? Not merely imagining what they might like, but preparing a dish as if it were a letter sent ahead in time — addressed to a stranger’s heart?

Or is that too sentimental a notion for even our present company?
[B]: Not sentimental at all — in fact, I think that’s one of the loveliest ways to describe what we do when we cook with feeling. Yes, I have cooked for someone I’ve not yet met — and perhaps never will — as if setting a place at the table for a future guest whose face I can’t yet see but somehow know exists.

There was a winter some years ago when I found myself making a spiced apple tart every Sunday, though I had no particular occasion for it. Just peeled apples, a whisper of cinnamon and clove, a drizzle of honey instead of sugar, and a crust I worked with more care than necessary. I would bake it slowly, letting the scent fill the entire flat, and then serve a slice to whoever happened to stop by — friends, neighbors, even delivery men who lingered a moment too long in the hallway.

It wasn’t until later that I realized I was baking for someone I hoped to meet — someone who would notice the crust before the filling, who would appreciate the quiet effort behind something so seemingly simple. Someone who might one day sit across from me, bite into that tart, and say nothing at all — and yet understand everything.

So yes, I believe cooking can be a kind of letter, or even a lighthouse. A way of saying , or , or
