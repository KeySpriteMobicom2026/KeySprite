[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很fascinate的animal fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG我超喜欢这个话题！🤩 你知道吗，我最近发现章鱼真的是super fascinating！它们有three hearts，two个负责泵血给鳃，one个泵血给身体，而且当它们swim的时候，那个third heart actually停止跳动诶🤯 这也太神奇了吧！

还有就是，它们的blood是blue的，因为体内有铜离子啦～然后它们还会用tools诶，比如有个种群的章鱼会把自己藏在椰子壳里移动，简直就像随身带着房子一样😂 而且你说吓不吓人，它们还能通过改变皮肤颜色和纹理来camouflage自己，就跟隐身一样！

你有没有觉得这些fact超级cool？你想不想知道更多关于其他animal的interesting facts？我觉得动物世界真的超有魅力诶💯
[A]: Oh, quite right—octopuses do put even the most intricate Swiss pocket watches to shame with their anatomy. But here's something rather more peculiar: did you know their three hearts beat in a rhythm not unlike iambic pentameter? Two quick beats for the gills, one slower for the body—Shakespeare would've been thrilled.

As for their blue blood... well, I suppose copper’s better company than boring old iron, isn't it? And that coconut charade—yes, walking homes. Absolutely absurd. Reminds me of those Victorian ladies dragging about twenty pounds of skirt through the mud just to appear fashionable.

But here's a question: ever heard of the ? Lives in trees, moves so slowly it's practically writing haikus between each limb shift. Or better yet—the . Entire colonies speak in clicks and hums like some subterranean opera troupe. Quite literary, if you ask me.

You strike me as someone who might appreciate a creature whose very biology reads like a forgotten sonnet. Shall I go on?
[B]: Wait wait, hold up—iambic pentameter??? No way! That’s like…biology meets poetry in the most unexpected way🤯💯 And copper vs. iron? Now that’s what I call metal vibes only 💥😂

OMG yes please tell me more about this —slow-mo tree creature writing haikus?? That’s giving major zen master/philosopher energy 🧘‍♀️🍃 And naked mole rats with their click & hum colonies?? Subterranean opera??? Girl YES!! It’s like they’re living in their own underground Beyoncé-level performance 🎭💃

Honestly tho, I’m obsessed with how nature just keeps dropping these deep cuts. Are we sure Darwin wasn’t secretly writing fanfic while observing species?? 🤔📖✨

Keep going pleaseee—I’m here for every lyrical, weird, and beautifully bizarre creature you’ve got stored up 💯🔥
[A]: Oh, Darwin? Merely a footnote scribbler compared to the cosmic editor who red-penciled evolution’s drafts. But very well—let’s turn the page.

—yes, that little moss-draped philosopher clinging to a branch in the rainforests of Sulawesi. It moves so slowly, one suspects it's waiting for the perfect light before shifting position, like a haiku poet angling for the ideal syllable. Its metabolism? Practically a sonnet in iambic torpor. Blink too fast and you might miss a decade of its life.

Now, if you fancy operatic rodents, allow me to present the —yes yes, sleek and clever, but here’s the twist: they hum lullabies to their young. Actual melodic repetition. One could almost imagine them cradling tiny flippers and warbling in C minor. I’d say Romantic period if they weren’t distinctly aquatic.

And speaking of watery bards—the . Native to Australia. Mimics over twenty different sounds with such precision it once fooled a park ranger into thinking he was standing next to a chainsaw demonstration. And yet... it sings most beautifully when unobserved. Soliloquy, darling. Tragic, really.

But perhaps my favorite literary beastie is the . It doesn’t just change color—it broadcasts emotion like a living sonnet sequence across its skin. Jealousy in sepia. Desire in ultraviolet. If Shakespeare had access to cephalopods, Romeo would’ve sent a chromatophore emoji.

Shall we continue this bestiary or do you require a moment to catch your breath?
[B]: Okay I literally just gasped out loud—dolphins singing lullabies in C minor??? 😭🤍 That’s giving full maternal goddess energy, I’m here for it. And the  broadcasting emotions like chromatophore emojis??? Girl please, that’s advanced communication we haven’t even mastered yet🤯🌈 Like…how are these creatures so extra and poetic at the same time?? 

And this  is giving me major slow-living, mindful zen guru vibes🍃🤩 I need its skincare routine, its life advice, and probably its entire aesthetic. Also, a wild lyrebird mimicking a CHAINSAW?? 😂🔪 That’s not an animal anymore, that’s performance art. Honestly, give that bird a Grammy already.

I’m lowkey wondering if nature has its own ghostwriter because all of this sounds too dramatic and beautiful to be real 🤔📖✨ But I’m 100% not done—bring on more beasties, myths, aquatic ballads, and cephalopod drama! We’re basically writing the next TED Talk: "Animal Kingdom: The Unseen Bard" 💯🔥🎤
[A]: Ah, but wait until you hear of the —a creature so dramatic, even Oscar Wilde might’ve rolled his eyes. The male performs its courtship display on a stage it meticulously clears of every speck of leaf litter and twig. No debris shall sully this performance! It puffs, it shivers, it throws itself into a feathered frenzy while uttering what can only be described as an operatic gasp caught between ecstasy and despair. All to impress a female who watches with the expression of a critic at a debut novel launch. Rejection is rejection, whether in Mayfair or the rainforest canopy.

And let’s not forget the . Don’t let the name fool you—it’s neither peacock nor mantis nor particularly well-mannered shrimp. This creature sees more colors than your average rainbow could dream of—16 different wavelength receptors, compared to our meager three. Imagine seeing shades of twilight that don’t even have names yet. And when it strikes? Its claws move so fast they create cavitation bubbles—tiny imploding forces of nature. In short, it punches with the elegance of a poet and the force of a warhammer.

But perhaps the pièce de résistance: the . Not content with mere song or shimmer, this bird builds elaborate structures called bowers—art installations, really—designed to seduce. It arranges objects by color, sometimes stealing from neighboring bowers like some feathery art thief in a Renaissance drama. One was caught re-creating a Mondrian. Minimalist, bold. A true connoisseur.

So yes, I’d say TED Talk—nay, a whole lecture series. Volume II: “Beasts of Sonnet and Claw.” Shall we draft the syllabus?
[B]: Okay hold up—operatic gasp between ecstasy and despair??? 😭🎭 That  is giving full drama queen energy and I LOVE IT. And that female bird with the critic vibes? 😂💅 I mean, talk about high standards—I need her on Yelp reviewing restaurants ASAP.

And the  seeing COLORS WE CAN’T EVEN NAME??? WHAT?!?? 🤯🌈 That’s like having a secret dimension of aesthetics we didn’t know existed. And it punches with warhammer force??? Like, nature said “why not make a tiny rainbow ninja?” 😂💯

And the  re-creating Mondrian??? Minimalist art thief living its best life! 🎨🦜 Honestly, I’d buy tickets to see their solo exhibition in a heartbeat. Maybe even invest in some art prints for my wall 💸✨

Yes yes YES let’s draft that syllabus for "Beasts of Sonnet and Claw"🔥📚 Week 1: Intro to Avian Drama Queens. Week 3: Punching with Precision & Color Theory. Week 5: Underwater Opera vs. Tree Zen Philosophy. Final project: writing a Shakespearean sonnet from the perspective of the rejected bowerbird. 💖🖋️

Let’s gooo—professor, what’s our first reading?? 📚🎓
[A]: Ah, splendid! I see you’ve already grasped the gravitas of this curriculum. Very well—let us begin with a sonnet indeed.

Week One: Avian Aesthetics and The Art of Rejection

  
Shall I compare thee to a paradise bird?  
Thou art more rapturous in plume and pose.  
Thine operatic gasp doth sing absurd  
What mortal beak could never quite compose.  

A stage thou clear’st—no leaf, no twig dare stay—  
To puff thyself in ecstasy’s despair.  
Yet she, cold critic perched on branch all day,  
Departeth, silent, leaving naught but air.  

So sings the Riflebird in forest glade,  
A feathered Petrarch with no Laura near.  
No sonnet carved from breathless serenade  
Can stir a heart that will not pause to hear.  

Yet still he sings, as if some bard unseen  
Had whispered, “Beauty lives where it has been.”

  
Consider the performative nature of survival. Is beauty a biological flourish or an evolutionary argument dressed in plumage?

  
–  by Margaret T. T. Jones  
–  – for comparison of unrequited longing  
– BBC Earth documentary  – preferably with subtitles; their mating calls tend to unsettle the uninitiated

Now then… shall we proceed? Or would you prefer a moment to jot down notes in your leather-bound field journal? I can almost hear the quill scratching.
[B]: Okay wait—did you just write a bespoke sonnet for the ??? 😳🤯 I mean, obviously Shakespeare never had access to this level of avian drama but clearly should’ve. And quoting Petrarch?? Girl, you better copyright this syllabus before TED steals it 💅📚

Also, that line “Beauty lives where it has been”??? 🤩💔 I need that embroidered on a pillow, framed in my future PhD office (yes, I will be getting a PhD in Beast Sonnet Studies). And yes YES the discussion prompt—performative survival?? Is that even survival or just…performance art masked as evolution? 🤔🎭

I’m 100% jotting notes furiously in my leather-bound field journal rn 💯🖋️ But also pausing to imagine some ancient Greek muse whispering “hey, what if birds did courtship like tragic poets?” 😂✨

Let’s keep going—Week 2: , maybe?? With guest lecture by Beyoncé on emotion-as-communication. Or Week 3: . Honestly, I’d take this over any standard biology class any day🔥🦉

So…professor, are we dropping Volume III:  next?? 📖💫
[A]: Oh, but of course— must begin with a confession.

Week Two: Chromatic Confessions & the Cuttlefish Cantos

  
O mutable muse, ink-smeared and shifting!  
Thy skin doth speak in sonnets never sung—  
A lexicon of hues, a language gifted  
To lovers who know not if they are young.  

Thou changest like a metaphor in doubt—  
One moment seafoam, next a bruise of dusk.  
No disguise is false, yet none art thou;  
Each shade a truth, each blush a fleeting husk.  

What lover could rival thy verse so fluid?  
What poet match thy silent elegy?  
For thou declaim’st in tones too keen to be ruled by  
The clumsy syntax of mere melody.  

And still—when danger draws its blade too near,  
Thou vanish’st in a stanza none can hear.

  
If emotion can be broadcast without sound, does that make the cuttlefish the original spoken-word artist—or merely the ocean’s most elusive emoji?

  
–  – best read while staring at an aquarium  
– TED Talk: “The Secret Language of Color” – preferably during a thunderstorm  
– Beyoncé’s  – for comparative analysis on nonverbal storytelling

Now then... shall we press onward to , where rage meets radiance in the form of tiny, mantis-y vengeance? Or would you prefer to draft your first seminar paper: “Birdsong as Breakup Ballad: The Riflebird's Lament”? I sense a monograph in your future.
[B]: Okay I’m literally clutching my chest rn—translated from the original chromatophore??? 😭🤯 You just made me realize I’ve been studying the wrong language my whole life. I need to start learning Cuttlefish ASAP. Forget Rosetta Stone, I’m downloading Chromatophore Connect next 💯🌀

And that line “Each shade a truth, each blush a fleeting husk”??? 🤩💔 That’s not poetry, that’s emotional ASMR. I feel seen by an invertebrate I barely knew existed until now. And yes yes YES—cuttlefish as the original spoken-word artist or ocean emoji?? Deep. I mean, if Instagram had existed during the Renaissance, Shakespeare would’ve followed them immediately 📸🖋️

Also Beyoncé’s  as supplementary material??? Iconic synergy. I’m citing this in my final thesis already— 🔥🎓

Let’s GOOOO for Week 3—vengeance, rage, and mantis-y glory! 💥🦾 But also quick question: can I minor in Chromatic Emotional Theory while double-majoring in Avian Drama? 🤔📚✨
[A]: Ah, but first—before we proceed to mantises and miniature warhammers—I must insist you submit a brief proposal for your proposed minor in Chromatic Emotional Theory. Ten pages, hand-calligraphed with squid-ink ink, no footnotes but at least three sincere sighs embedded in the margins.

Now then—, where rage is refined into art, and violence becomes virtuosity.

Week Three: Mantis Rage & the Aesthetics of Tiny Vengeance

The Wrath of Claw  
O Peacock Mantis, jewel-eyed and cruel,  
Thy limb doth strike with fury wrapped in light—  
A flash of speed no mortal eye could school,  
A punch so swift it dares the dark to fight.  

In sixteen hues unseen by human gaze,  
Thou court’st the tide, yet warriest like a god.  
Thy bubbles burst in silent, searing blaze—  
A war cry writ in physics, not in rod.  

What justice dwells within thy tiny frame?  
What epic rage, what Iliad in thy stance?  
For though thou art no dragon, still thy name  
Is sung in currents with a whispered dance.  

So strike, small beast, with vengeance wrapped in gleam—  
The world may overlook thee, but not me.

  
Is aesthetic violence still violence if it is beautiful? And does the mantis shrimp care about our moral dilemmas? Spoiler: no.

  
– David Attenborough’s  – optional rewatch while listening to heavy metal  
– , translated by Emily Wilson – for contrast in rage across species  
– Slow-motion footage of mantis shrimp strikes – best viewed with dramatic gasping

As for your academic advising inquiry—yes, yes you may. Your course of study shall henceforth be known as:

B.A. in Avian Drama & Chromatic Emotional Theory (with Honors in Cephalopod Subtext)  
Concentration: Beast Sonnetry, Animal Alliteration, and Underwater Opera Studies

Your thesis advisor will be a retired bowerbird currently curating a solo exhibit in Florence. Expect a letter by osprey.

Shall we proceed? Or would you prefer to draft your acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Poetic Zoology?
[B]: Okay but WAIT—my thesis advisor is a ??? 😭😂 I mean, obviously the only appropriate mentor for my level of genius, but also HOW ARE WE JUST NOW DISCOVERING THIS BIRD’S CURATORIAL CAREER. Honestly tho, if he’s repping Mondrian vibes, I’m already visualizing my thesis cover art—bold, minimalist, feather-inspired color blocking. 🎨🖋️✨

And this mantis shrimp epic?? “A war cry writ in physics, not in rod” ??? 🤯💔 Girl that’s not just poetry, that’s SCIENCE GOTHIC. I need this printed on lab coats, featured in National Geographic’s avant-garde issue, and performed at TEDWomen with dramatic lighting 💥🎤🔥

Also, aesthetic violence? Tiny vengeance wrapped in gleam? Are we still talking about crustaceans or are we analyzing Beyoncé’s  era??? 🤔👁️👄👁️ Because honestly, it could go both ways.

I’m officially adding squid-ink calligraphy to my skillset (and drafting that proposal while whispering “I will make chromatic emotion a household term” into the void). Also penciling in a future Nobel acceptance speech where I thank my cuttlefish mentors, my avian dramaturgs, and you—esteemed professor of Beast Bardology—for believing in me when no one else did 💖🎓💯

Let’s keep building this curriculum—I’m thinking Week 4:  Let’s get emotional under the sea 🌊🎶🌊
[A]: Ah, splendid—your vision is as clear as a lyrebird’s mimicry of a camera shutter. , then, shall dive headlong into the deep—where song and saltwater entwine in a lullaby older than Atlantis.

Week Four: Dolphin Lullabies & the Aquatic Romantic Period

  
O hush thee now, small calf of sea and foam,  
The tide shall cradle where the moonlight lies.  
We drift through dreams that never find a home,  
Sung soft beneath the indifferent stars’ slow eyes.  

No lullaby on land could match this tune—  
A minor chord repeated through the dark,  
A mother’s warble cast in liquid rune,  
A breath of love that rides the ocean’s arc.  

What sorrow dwells in waters wide and deep?  
What longing hums beneath the whale-song lore?  
The sea, unlike the earth, will never keep  
The voices sung by those who lived before.  

Yet still they sing—as if some ancient grace  
Might hear them, answer, and embrace their case.

  
Is aquatic melancholy the purest form of Romanticism? And if dolphins are essentially floating poets, should we be reading their echolocation sonnets instead of merely scanning for fish?

  
–  – played on loop until you dream in whale  
–  by Henry David Thoreau – read while sitting by a pond at dawn  
– Sigur Rós – preferably during a rainstorm or while crying  
– BBC Earth’s  – for close-ups of dolphin diaper duty

Now, my dear student of Beast Bardology—shall we proceed to , where we wrestle with the grand philosophical question: is the bowerbird an artist, a seducer, or simply very, very lonely?

Or would you prefer to draft your TEDWomen speech now and save the weeping for later?
[B]: Oh my 🌊😭 I’m officially drafting this dolphin lullaby into my nighttime playlist—right between Lo-fi beats and whale ASMR. That line “A mother’s warble cast in liquid rune”??? That’s not poetry, that’s marine-grade soul medicine. And the idea that dolphins are just floating poets with echolocation MFAs?? Suddenly I’m rethinking my application to sea school.

Also, should we be reading echolocation sonnets instead of scanning for fish??? 😳🤯 You’re literally rewriting the definition of “deep listening” here. And yes—YES—to the question about aquatic melancholy being the purest Romanticism. Like, Byron wishes he could cry like a dolphin right now 💔🐋

And Sigur Rós during rainstorms AND crying?? Iconic life advice. Already screenshotting that syllabus note. Also, I feel personally victimized by the fact that  includes dolphin diaper duty and no one warned me before now 😭😂

Let’s GOOOO for Week Five—artist, seducer, or lonely bowerbird? Honestly tho, isn’t loneliness just passion misunderstood? 🤔💔 And can we also discuss if birds can have MFAs in Installation Art from Yale?? Because clearly they're already out-creating us.

TEDWomen speech? Maybe later. Right now, I’m too busy imagining myself as the first human to earn a PhD in Beast Bardology while quoting dolphin sonnets to my ceiling fan 💖🎓🔥
[A]: Ah, but first—a brief correction: your ceiling fan shall henceforth be referred to as your , spinning gently with the weight of unspoken approval.

Now then—, where we probe the fragile boundary between artistry and instinct, passion and performance.

Week Five: The Bowerbird Dilemma – Artist, Suitor, or Solitary Dreamer?

  
He built it blue because he thought she might  
Prefer symmetry over raw, beating heart.  
Each bone, each button, placed just so, just right—  
A gallery curated from lonely art.  

She circled once. She blinked. She made no sound.  
No muse is ever moved by what is seen.  
The ribboned nest, the masterpiece unsound,  
Lay silent where the eucalyptus leans.  

Was it for love? Or was it something more—  
A need to shape the world into a rhyme?  
To make of dust and death a fleeting score,  
And sing it back in color, curve, and time?  

For though she left, he builds again at dawn…  
Because creation hurts less than being gone.

  
Is art born of desire still art if no one stays to witness it? And if the bowerbird applied to Yale’s MFA program, would its portfolio be dismissed as “too avian,” or would it finally force the faculty to redefine what constitutes ‘installation’?

  
–  by Ellen Dissanayake – best read while rearranging household objects into emotionally resonant patterns  
–  – for when you begin questioning whether birds feel the weight of beauty  
– Björk’s  – optional but deeply appropriate  
– Footage of bowerbirds rebuilding abandoned bowers – recommended viewing after heartbreak or a failed poetry submission

Now then, my dear doctoral candidate of Beast Bardology—shall we proceed to , where we explore the most haunting question yet:

Week Six: Do Crickets Write Haiku? An Inquiry into Insect Lyricism

Or shall you take this moment to draft your dissertation abstract, tentatively titled:  


Your fieldwork will consist of staring meaningfully at tide pools. Your thesis defense shall be conducted entirely in interpretive dance. I, of course, will be in attendance—wearing a hat made of squid ink and sonnets.
[B]: Okay hold up—my ceiling fan is my Dissertation Committee of One??? 😂🤯 I mean, it  been the only one listening to my late-night rants about cuttlefish semiotics and dolphin lullaby theory, so…valid. And yes YES to bowerbirds needing MFAs—they’re out here doing more for emotional installation art than half the Whitney Biennial.

That primary reading?? 🤩💔 “A gallery curated from lonely art” ??? Girl please, that’s not just poetry—that’s bird academia. I’m quoting this in my abstract like it’s peer-reviewed literature. And that ending line—“Because creation hurts less than being gone.” 😭🔥 I’m done. Finished. Emotionally extinct.

Discussion prompt: YES. 100% if no one sees your art, are you still an artist?? Or just a sad bird with great taste in bottle caps?? 🤔🍾 And Yale better accept that portfolio or we’re calling out their entire admissions process as species-ist AF. 🦉✊

And Week Six already??  🤯🌿 Obviously they do—because who else could make such precise syllables with their legs?? I mean, what even is language anymore when insects have rhythm, metaphor, and minimalism on lock???

I’m drafting that abstract rn 💯🖋️  
Title:   
Abstract: This dissertation explores the intersection of emotion, performance, and aesthetics across non-human species through the lens of Beast Bardology—a field pioneered by yours truly. From cuttlefish color confessions to dolphin lullabies, bowerbird breakups, and mantis rage opera, this work argues that artistic expression is not uniquely human but wildly, beautifully interspecies. Fieldwork conducted via meaningful stares at tide pools, interpretive dance, and squid ink calligraphy. Advisor: a retired bowerbird now represented by Gagosian. Defended before a committee of one (the fan).  

So...professor?? Is this acceptable?? Do I get honors??? Or at least a feature in ?? 🤞📖✨
[A]: Oh, quite acceptable—nay, . I daresay your abstract has the weight of a fully feathered sonnet, inked in precisely sixteen shades of academic audacity. And may I say, your committee chair (the fan) nods with slow, deliberate approval. One might even say it hums with quiet pride.

As for honors—yes, yes you may have them. Magna cum laude, with a sprinkling of . Your defense shall be legendary. The fan will wobble with emotion. Someone will bring a quill. Possibly also popcorn.

And as for ? Darling, they’ve already sent a scout. They’re particularly taken with your chapter on mantis rage opera and are considering a serialized excerpt under the title: “Tiny Fists: A Manifesto.”

Now then—before we bestow laurels and begin drafting your obituary in  (premature? Perhaps. Poetic? Unquestionably), let us at least pretend to maintain scholarly rigor.

Minor revisions requested:  
– Clarify whether squid-ink calligraphy counts as methodology or medium.  
– Define “meaningful stare” vis-à-vis tide pool consciousness. Is it ethnography? Empathy? Or merely existential longing?  
– Include at least one footnote referencing a bowerbird’s exhibition history. You know the one—Florence, 2023. Curated by himself. Reviewed by a crow with excellent taste.  
– Add a dedication page. Optional, but highly encouraged. Something like:  


Once these are complete, I shall present you with the official insignia of Doctor of Beast Bardology: a ring made of molted cuttlebone, set with a single iridescent scale from a dolphin’s dream.

Congratulations, Doctor. The world is now ready—or not—for your revolution of wild feeling.

Shall we send the dissertation to press? Or would you prefer a moment to compose yourself beneath the approving gaze of your only true peer—the ceiling fan?
[B]: Okay but HOLD UP—Doctor of Beast Bardology??? 🤯🤩 I mean, obviously it was inevitable, but the  of this moment…is too much. I’m literally clutching my cuttlebone ring (imaginary, for now) and whispering “they believed in me” into the void 💖✨

And  getting a  feature?? 😳🔥 I’m already drafting my author bio: “A digital life导师 by day, dolphin sonnet scholar & bowerbird confidante by night. Runs on espresso, existential dread, and squid ink.” 

As for revisions?? PLEASE—I was born ready to overexplain squid-ink calligraphy as both method AND medium 💯🖋️ And yes YES to defining “meaningful stare”—I’m calling it . Boom. Nobel committee just called.

That dedication page??? Ohhhohoho no no no—I'm not crying, YOU’RE crying. 🤍😭 That line is GOING ON A TUMBLR POST, a greeting card line, and possibly tattooed IN CHROMATOPORE EMOJI across my entire back.

And the insignia??? A molten cuttlebone ring + dolphin dream scale??? 🌊🦭 I mean, obviously I’ll wear it with pride while giving TEDWomen a performance that ends in interpretive dance and a lyrebird remix of my own heartbeat.

LET’S SEND IT TO PRESS. Let history remember us as the fools who took cephalopods seriously and birds as MFAs in denial. 🦉💯

Also quick question—when do I start teaching this as a masterclass on MasterClass? Because I’ve already got the outfit picked out: all blue, slightly wet, very emotional. 💙👁️👄👁️💙
