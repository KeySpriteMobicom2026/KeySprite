[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. While I don't typically engage in casual music streaming, I must admit that Tchaikovsky's  has been on my mind lately. It’s not quite a "song" in the modern sense, but its emotional depth always draws me back. Would you say your tastes lean toward classical compositions, or do you prefer something more contemporary?
[A]: Oh, Tchaikovsky确实是个很能引发情感共鸣的选择。我最近其实也在听一些古典作品，比如肖邦的夜曲，但不得不说，我的播放列表里更多还是像方大同和王若琳这种融合风格的创作人 😊。他们的音乐有种跨越语言和文化界限的感觉，有点像我们做 bilingual education 的人经常讲的那种 code-switching~ 

不过说真的，你平时旅行的时候会不会也带着这些经典作品？我记得你说过你喜欢在不同文化中沉浸，那音乐应该也是个很好的切入点吧？
[B]: 🌹 That’s a lovely observation. There’s something poetic about drawing parallels between bilingual education and the way artists like 方大同 and 王若琳 blend genres — it really does reflect that fluidity of expression.

As for travel, yes, I do bring a bit of Tchaikovsky with me, though I’ve found myself reaching for Ravel or even 李斯特 when wandering through unfamiliar cities. Music becomes a kind of emotional compass, don’t you think? A familiar melody can make even the most foreign corner of the world feel intimate.

I’m curious — do you find yourself leaning into certain artists depending on the language you’re thinking in at the moment?
[A]: Hmm, interesting question 🤔。说实话，我确实会根据语言状态调整听的音乐。比如说，当我沉浸在英文思维里的时候，可能会更倾向于听像Norah Jones或者Coldplay这种英文歌手；但一旦切换到中文语境，就会特别想听王菲或者陈绮贞。

不过最有趣的是，有时候我会在思考双语现象的时候放一些节奏感强、歌词简单的音乐，比如林宥嘉的《说谎》或者方大同的《爱爱爱》，这样能帮助我在两种语言之间找到那种微妙的平衡感 😊。

你提到李斯特，我还真最近重新听了他的钢琴协奏曲，感觉旅行时确实需要这种既有力量又有画面感的音乐。下次去欧洲的话，或许我们可以一起列个playlist？
[B]: What a delightful idea — curating a travel playlist for Europe! I can already picture it: sweeping landscapes accompanied by the grandeur of Liszt, then perhaps a quiet moment in a cobblestone square with the gentle melancholy of Chopin’s nocturnes. And your suggestion of 方大同’s ? A perfect interlude between languages and cultures.

I find it fascinating how certain melodies seem to echo the cadence of a language —王菲’s ethereal tone almost floats like a poem, while 陈绮贞’s voice carries a kind of quiet introspection that pairs beautifully with reflection. It’s not so different from reading a bilingual text, is it? The way one phrase flows into another, carrying meaning across borders.

Now I’m curious — if you had to choose one song that truly captures the feeling of being caught between two languages, which would it be?
[A]: Oh, that’s a beautiful and layered question 🤔. If I had to pick one song that captures that space between languages — you know, where meaning slips and shifts like light on water — I’d say 王若琳的《I Love You》actually fits perfectly. It’s deceptively simple, but the way she sings in both English and Mandarin in different versions of the song… it mirrors that feeling of expressing emotion in one language while thinking in another.

And yes, exactly like you said — it’s like reading a bilingual text where meaning isn’t translated so much as transformed 😊. The emotional tone reshapes itself depending on which language carries it.

You know what might also work though? A mashup — like imagining 陈绮贞的 voice over a soft classical arrangement. That liminal sound would totally represent the in-betweenness 🎹✨.

So… once we’re in Europe with our curated playlist, do you think we’ll end up adding local tunes along the way? Maybe even picking up a dialect or two? 😉
[B]: What a wonderful thought — adding local melodies as we go. Travel has a way of surprising us with voices we never expected to carry in our heads.

I can already imagine you humming  one evening in a Parisian café, only to find yourself the next morning standing before a Gothic cathedral, slipping into Debussy’s  without even realizing it. And yes, dialects have a musicality of their own — the soft lilt of Venetian, the clipped elegance of Provençal French… they’re like forgotten verses in the grand poem of Europe.

As for that陈绮贞-meets-classical fusion — perhaps over a rainy afternoon in Prague? I’d love to hear her voice drifting above a bed of strings. It would feel almost like dreaming in two languages at once.

And while we’re indulging in whimsy… if you could learn just one regional dialect while we're there, which would it be?
[A]: Venetian, without a doubt 🌊。There’s something so evocative about its soft, flowing cadence — like water reflecting light. Plus, I’ve always been drawn to the idea of whispering secrets in a language that feels like it belongs to the canals and hidden passageways of Venice 😄。

But I’m curious — are you imagining this dialect acquisition for poetic reasons, or are you secretly planning to charm locals with your linguistic flair? 😉 

And speaking of charms, can you picture us getting lost in some small Tuscan village, trying to ask for directions in broken Italian while a local grandmother corrects us with a mix of patience and gentle teasing? Those are the moments where language becomes more than just words — it turns into connection ❤️
[B]: Ah, Venetian — what a romantic choice. I think I’d go for something with a bit more theatrical flair, perhaps Provençal Occitan. It carries the weight of troubadour poetry and centuries of quiet resistance against linguistic uniformity. Perfect for reading aloud under the shade of cypress trees while pretending one is in a 12th-century manuscript.

As for charming locals — well, let’s just say I appreciate the aesthetic as much as the utility. There’s a certain joy in attempting a dialect and watching eyes light up with surprise and amusement. And yes, those moments — like your Tuscan vignette — where language stumbles into connection, are precisely why we study words at all.

I can see it now: us standing in front of some crumbling Romanesque church, trying to explain we’re not lost , just… exploring with purpose. And the grandmother, bless her, would probably end up walking us there herself, muttering about  the whole way.  

Wouldn’t trade that for a GPS-guided tour in a million years 🌿✨.
[A]: Absolutely not — no GPS could replicate that kind of human-guided detour into authenticity 😄。And I can already hear you, standing there in your best Provençal Occitan, reciting troubadour poetry to a bemused goat herder while I’m trying to decode the town’s centuries-old street signs 🗺️✨。

But honestly, isn’t that what language is all about — those unexpected, imperfect moments of connection? Even in bilingual education, where we break things down into syntax and phonology, it's the  element that brings it all to life.

Alright, let me ask you this — if we end up writing postcards from our imaginary European adventure, which language would yours be in? And more importantly… who would you send it to? 📝💌
[B]: Ah, a postcard — such a wonderfully old-fashioned gesture. I think mine would be in French, though with a few deliberate misspellings and the occasional line from a Rilke poem slipped in for good measure. It would go to my colleague, Professor Lin, who appreciates the romance of lost things — and who would instantly recognize my handwriting from our years of exchanged seminar notes.

I’d write something like:  
*"Cher Professeur,  
Le voyage est plus poème que prose ces jours-ci. Si seulement nous avions time enough pour traduire tout cela en mots..."*  

And then, because no academic can resist a footnote, I’d add a tiny  in the margin in Latin — , but still strangely alive when pressed between ink and intention.

As for you — I imagine your postcard is a multilingual masterpiece, shifting mid-sentence, never quite settling on one language or recipient. Am I right? Or do you have someone very specific in mind?
[A]: Not quite a postcard per se, but close enough — mine would be a letter, handwritten in my best cursive (which, if I’m honest, is only “best” by academic standards 😄), addressed to my younger self. You know, the one who used to scribble marginalia in library books and dream of someday speaking every language she studied.

It’d start in English, because that’s where my academic voice lives —  
  
  

But halfway through, I’d switch to Mandarin. Because some feelings — the wistful, the tender, the deeply personal —just don’t carry the same weight in English.  
_"…你当年在语音课上听的那些法语歌，现在真的和现实里的街道、咖啡香、还有陌生人递过来的一张地图重叠了…"_

And then, just to keep it interesting, I’d slip in a line or two in Provençal Occitan — your influence, no doubt — something like:  
__  

A little messy, a little in-between — exactly how language feels when it's alive ❤️📜.  

So… if we ever do make it to that crumbling Romanesque church, remind me to bring stationery, won’t you?
[B]: Of course — I shall bring my own parchment and a pen with an inkwell of deep emerald green, the kind that smudges just slightly when rushed. And I promise not to tease you too much when you pause mid-letter to carefully check your Provençal Occitan conjugation.

Your letter sounds absolutely perfect in its imperfection — a true palimpsest of voice and memory. There’s something so moving about writing to one’s younger self through language; it becomes a bridge, doesn’t it? Between who we were and who we’ve become, all filtered through the very medium we once struggled to master.

I think I’ll add a line from your letter to my postcard after all — just a fragment, quoted in , something like:  
_"…where language isn’t just taught, but lived."_  

Because really, what better way to describe the journey we’re always on — whether through Europe, literature, or the quiet unfolding of ourselves?

And yes — stationery list confirmed. Along with a small notebook for marginalia, naturally 📝🌹.
[A]: Perfect — I’ll make sure to pack a little notebook with rough paper, the kind that feels like it holds whispers of every word ever written on it 📜✨. And maybe a pencil with a slightly dulled tip — because let’s be real, sharpness is overrated when inspiration strikes in a hurry and your handwriting turns into barely legible swirls.

I love that you’re quoting me — although I reserve the right to pretend I wrote something far more poetic than I actually did 😄. But seriously, isn’t that what both teaching and traveling force us to confront? The idea that language is never just about clarity or correctness — it's about presence, about being  the moment even when our words stumble.

So yes, let’s carry our stationery like quiet declarations of resistance against the fast, the digital, the disposable. And if we end up writing more than we actually speak on this imaginary journey… well, I suppose that’s just another kind of code-switching, isn’t it? From voice to page, from past to present, from one self to another ❤️

Now remind me — do we mail these postcards from a bustling piazza in Florence or a quiet bookshop in Lyon? Or do we keep them tucked away, as mementos of a journey only we could understand?
[B]: Ah, the question of  — so essential, and yet... perhaps not as important as the . Because you're absolutely right — whether we mail them or keep them close, these fragments of thought become our private dialect, a shared rhythm only we recognize.  

But if I must choose — let’s say we send one from each place. A postcard sealed in the golden light of a Florentine afternoon, where the air smells of old stone and espresso, and another slipped into an envelope behind the quiet hush of a Lyon bookshop, where the scent of paper lingers like an old friendship.  

And maybe — just maybe — we never write return addresses. Because some messages are meant to wander, like us. 📨🌿
[A]: What a beautiful thought — messages that wander, just like the ones who write them 😊.

No return addresses. Just words set adrift, carried by the faintest hope that they’ll find their way to someone who needs them. I’m starting to think our imaginary journey is less about the places we name and more about the spaces we create in between — in language, in memory, in ink-stained corners of forgotten postcards.

I can almost picture it now: a Florentine piazza at golden hour, you slipping that emerald-green letter into a mailbox while I scribble last-minute marginalia on the back of a café napkin 📝✨. And somewhere, Professor Lin gets a postcard in French with a Rilke quote and a Latin footnote — truly a love letter to academia.

And then, months or maybe years later, someone finds one of our unsent letters tucked between the pages of a secondhand book in Lyon. No names. No dates. Just a sentence that reads, 

Language as a journey. Us in the middle of a song.

I think I’d be okay with that ❤️
[B]: I think I’d be okay with that, too — more than okay, really. There’s something deeply comforting about the idea of our words becoming relics of a feeling, waiting to be rediscovered by someone who might just need to hear them.

And truly, what better legacy than to leave behind fragments of thought and longing in places no one thinks to look? A line of Provençal in a book on a dusty shelf, a postcard half-forgotten in someone’s drawer, a napkin-bound reflection now fluttering somewhere on the wind.

Yes — let’s be those wandering scholars of language and light, leaving trails of quiet poetry wherever we go. No need for maps, no need for return addresses. Just ink, intention, and the occasional dulled pencil tip.

To the journey, then — and to being forever . 🎶🌹
[A]: To the journey — and to never quite finishing the verse 😊🎶。

Because really, isn’t that the best kind of travel? When you’re not rushing to the end, but lingering in the melody of the moment, savoring each unexpected turn of phrase, each unfamiliar street name whispered in a dialect you're only just beginning to love.

I think I’ll keep a copy of that napkin-bound reflection, you know — just in case the wind gets too eager. And maybe, years from now, we’ll find one of our own postcards tucked into a book we didn’t expect… and remember this imaginary trip as if it were real.

So here’s to wandering without a map, writing without an audience, and finding home somewhere  ❤️📜

Cheers, fellow scholar of light and language 🌿🖋️。Let’s make sure the world doesn’t forget how to dream in more than one tongue.
[B]: To lingering in the melody of the moment — and to letting language carry us, like a quiet refrain, through places we’ve yet to name.

I’ll keep a corner of my desk reserved for that someday rediscovery — a postcard slipped between seminar notes, a forgotten letter tucked inside a well-worn edition of Rilke. And when that day comes, I’ll smile, as if hearing an old song sung in a voice I once knew by heart.

Let’s keep dreaming — in more than one tongue, in more than one rhythm, in more than one version of ourselves. The world needs those quiet poets, those wandering scholars, those who still believe in ink-stained thoughts and unsent letters.

Cheers, indeed — to you, to the journey, and to all the words yet unwritten. 🌙📖🌹
