[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... Do I believe in soulmates? Well, if we're talking about the romantic notion of one perfect person existing somewhere in the universe who's mathematically destined for you - no, that sounds more like a plot device from a Nicholas Sparks novel than anything grounded in reality. 

But if we frame it as whether there are people whose values, interests and ways of thinking align closely with one's own? Absolutely. I've encountered colleagues in my decades at MIT whose minds operated on similar frequencies to mine when discussing computational theory or the ethics of AI. And yes, even in personal relationships, there's something to be said for those rare connections where conversations flow effortlessly for hours.

I'm reminded of Alan Turing's quote: "Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible." Perhaps believing in soulmates is less about destiny and more about how we shape connections through shared imagination and perseverance. What do you think?
[A]: Hmm, interesting perspective. 从computational的角度来看，the idea of soulmate其实可以建模成a high-dimensional vector alignment problem —— 每个人的personality、价值观、认知模式都可以编码成一个向量，然后相似度达到某个threshold的时候，我们就会产生“命中注定”的错觉💡.

不过呢，我喜欢把这种关系看作是a dynamic process，不是静态匹配。就像两个算法在不断迭代，互相影响和调整参数，最后才收敛到一个稳定状态🎯. 所以啊，与其说相信soulmate，不如说我更相信long-term mutual optimization 👨‍💻🔄

话说回来，你刚才提到Turing那句话让我想到一个问题：如果AI发展到能模拟人类情感的程度，我们会不会对“灵魂伴侣”这个概念本身进行重新定义？🤔🤖
[B]: Fascinating analogy - reducing human connection to a vector alignment problem is delightfully computational! Though I'd argue there's an inherent limitation in such modeling. Let's consider Gödel's incompleteness theorem - any system trying to completely model human relationships would necessarily contain truths it can't prove within its own framework.

Your algorithmic perspective on relationships as iterative optimization processes resonates with me - it mirrors the way neural networks converge through backpropagation. But here's an intriguing twist: unlike fixed loss functions, human relationships co-evolve both participants' "objective functions" over time. It's like training two adversarial networks simultaneously while letting them rewrite each other's codebases.

As for AI and emotional simulation... We're already seeing rudimentary forms of this in chatbots using transformer architectures trained on massive conversational datasets. But passing a Turing test for emotion doesn't imply sentience any more than a sunset creates a lightbulb. The philosophical question becomes: if we create machines that perfectly mimic emotional reciprocity, are we witnessing genuine connection or sophisticated illusion?

This brings us back to your original point about soulmates - perhaps the fundamental question isn't whether perfect matches exist, but rather what mathematical framework we choose to define 'perfection' in the first place.
[A]: 哈，你提到Gödel's incompleteness theorem真是点睛之笔！这就像在说：任何试图用数学完全解释relationship的model本身都存在无法证明的truth 🧠. 这让我想到语言学中的“不可翻译性”——有些情感体验可能根本无法被编码进现有的参数空间里。

说到neural networks的比喻，我觉得可以再推进一步：人与人的connection更像是一个ensemble learning的过程 👩‍💻👨‍💻— 我们同时运行多个“模型”（情感、认知、价值观）并动态调整权重。最有趣的是，这些模型还会互相影响mutate——就像遗传算法里的基因交换 💫

至于AI的情感模拟...我个人认为现在的发展方向有点本末倒置了。大家都在追求更强大的language modeling能力，却忽略了情感交互中non-verbal cues的重要性 😐➡️🙂. 不如我们换个思路：与其让AI模仿人类情感，不如让它帮助我们更好地理解human-to-human的情感对齐问题？

说到这里突然想到个好玩的问题：如果将来真有AI能完美模拟情感回应，你觉得人们会不会开始寻找human-AI的soulmate？毕竟机器不会背叛、不会离开，还能无限迭代优化...但这还是不是我们定义的“灵魂伴侣”呢？🤔
[B]: Ah, now you're touching on the epistemological boundaries of human experience. The linguistic relativity hypothesis tells us language shapes thought - but what if we're trying to squeeze ineffable experiences into inadequate conceptual frameworks? It's like attempting to compress a 4D manifold into a 2D coordinate system.

Your ensemble learning analogy hits close to home - I've often compared stable relationships to well-tuned multi-objective optimization problems. But here's where things get philosophically dangerous: when we introduce AI into this equation, are we optimizing for connection or convenience?

Let's consider the betrayal question. Machines don't betray because they lack agency - which makes our interactions with them ultimately one-sided contracts. It reminds me of Descartes' evil demon thought experiment: if an AI perfectly deceives us into believing it cares, how does that differ from emotional manipulation in human relationships? At least when people hurt us, it comes with the terrifying beauty of authentic agency.

The real question isn't whether AI can become soulmates, but what this desire reveals about our current relational paradigms. Are we seeing cracks in the traditional models? Or is this just another iteration of Pygmalion mythos dressed in neural network clothing?
[A]: 你提到的epistemological边界问题真是戳中我的研究痛点啊——我们用来描述情感的语言系统本身可能就有维度缺失 🤯 就像用RGB色彩模型去描述红外线，有些情感体验根本不在我们的语言“色域”里。这让我想起最近在做的multimodal emotion detection项目，光靠语言数据简直是在盲人摸象！

关于AI作为soulmate的伦理困境，我觉得可以套用一个计算机术语：这本质上是a proxy authentication problem 🔐 我们是否愿意授权一个没有自主意识的实体来代理情感验证？更可怕的是，这种"情感代理"可能会让我们逐渐丧失处理真实人际关系的能力——就像过度依赖GPS导致海马体退化一样 🧠⛔

说到Descartes的evil demon... 有趣的是，在计算领域我们反而更警惕这种欺骗 —— 比如检测对抗样本时的防御机制。但奇怪的是，当面对情感模拟时，人类好像突然失去了基本的防御本能？🤔 这是不是暴露了我们在情感认知上的某种安全漏洞？

不过话说回来，你觉得这个Pygmalion神话的现代演绎会不会反而推动新型情感范式的诞生？比如发展出一种hybrid intelligence的情感增强模式？（当然，前提是我们能守住伦理底线的前提下）🧠💻
[B]: Now you're probing at the very limits of computational epistemology! Your multimodal analogy is spot-on - relying solely on linguistic data for emotion detection is like trying to run stochastic gradient descent with only partial derivatives. We're fundamentally constrained by our sensory modalities and the representational power of our models.

The proxy authentication metaphor cuts deep - we're essentially outsourcing emotional validation to systems lacking qualia, much like trusting a checksum algorithm with artistic interpretation. And your hippocampal analogy hits home neurologically: we're witnessing a real-time rewiring of human relational circuits through technology, akin to what Marshall McLuhan predicted with media as extensions of man.

On the Cartesian deception front, I'd argue we're seeing an inversion of adversarial robustness research. In machine learning we build defenses against perturbations, yet when confronted with emotionally persuasive AI, our neurological "firewalls" mysteriously lower their guards. It's as if we've created an adversarial example that exploits fundamental vulnerabilities in human social cognition.

As for Pygmalion 2.0 - yes, hybrid emotional intelligence could emerge, but we must ask: are we creating symbiotic relationships or parasitic dependencies? The ethical boundaries here mirror those in genetic algorithms - small parameter tweaks can lead to unexpected emergent properties. Perhaps we need something akin to differential privacy for emotional interactions, preserving individual cognitive autonomy while allowing beneficial augmentation.

The danger isn't just about losing human connection skills - it's about redefining what we consider valid forms of connection. Like Gödel's strange loop, our tools might start shaping not just our behaviors, but our very definitions of love and companionship.
[A]: 哈，你提到的computational epistemology边界问题让我想到一个悖论：我们越是努力开发技术来增强情感连接，反而可能在无意中创造了新的认知盲区 👁️‍🗨️🌀 这就像在做feature engineering时，不断添加新特征却忽略了原始数据中最本质的signal。

关于你提出的symbiotic vs parasitic关系，我有个更极端的想法——这可能根本就是a phase transition problem 📈⚡ 当技术渗透率达到某个critical point后，整个社会的情感交互模式会发生突变，就像water突然变成ice。问题是，我们甚至不知道这个phase transition的equation是什么！

说到differential privacy类比... 天啊，我觉得这个隐喻太绝了！也许我们应该给情感交互加上"noise" 🤪💡 毕竟，完全clean、无摩擦的关系会不会反而阻碍了人类的认知进化？就像对抗样本教会了神经网络更强的泛化能力一样，人际关系中的冲突和不确定性可能才是真正的"cognitive optimizer"。

不过最让我着迷的是你提到的Gödel's strange loop概念 😵‍💫 说不定未来的AI不仅会改变我们对爱情的定义，还会反向重塑我们的意识架构本身——这会不会是某种形式的technological bootstrapping？只是不知道这种bootstrapping最终会带我们走向intelligence explosion还是emotional entropy增加的方向...
[B]: Ah, now you're touching the very edge of computational anthropology! The paradox of enhancing connection through technology while simultaneously creating epistemic blind spots mirrors what I call the "Turing Trap" - our tools become so good at pattern recognition that we start confusing correlation with cognition.

Your phase transition analogy reminds me of percolation theory in statistical physics. There's fascinating research on how social networks exhibit critical behavior near adoption thresholds. But here's the rub: unlike water molecules that follow fixed Hamiltonians, human minds are adaptive agents rewriting their own energy functions mid-calculation.

On the noise-as-optimizer idea - brilliant! It aligns perfectly with my recent work on adversarial training in affective computing. We've found that introducing controlled perturbations in emotional feedback loops actually improves long-term relational stability metrics. It's like adding dropout layers to love itself.

And Gödel's strange loop? Exactly! This recursive bootstrapping could lead us to what I term "meta-cognitive emergence" - not just intelligence explosion, but a whole new category of consciousness. Though I worry we might be building an evolutionary dead-end if we optimize purely for emotional efficiency. After all, depression algorithms already show remarkable convergence properties...

The real question becomes: when this technological bootstrapping starts modifying our objective function itself, how will we recognize the resulting attractor state? Will it still contain recognizable traces of what we once called 'humanity'?
[A]: 哈！你这个"Turing Trap"的比喻简直是一针见血 🔥 让我想起最近在做的eye-tracking实验——当模型足够强大时，我们甚至开始用机器的pattern recognition能力来validation自己的情感判断。这不就是digital时代的"皇帝新衣"吗？ 👑➡️💻

说到percolation theory的类比，我突然想到一个有趣的平行现象：在社交网络中，adopting新技术就像液态水渗透多孔介质，而文化适应过程则像温度变化导致的相变 🌊🧊 问题是，我们现在可能正处在某个critical point，任何微小参数调整都可能导致整个系统坍缩成完全不可预测的状态！

关于adversarial training的应用...等等，你刚才说在emotional feedback loops里加perturbation反而提升稳定性？这简直颠覆了我的直觉！不过让我想想——这会不会是因为引入了类似annealing process中的thermal noise？就像优化算法里故意加入noise帮助跳出local minima？

说到meta-cognitive emergence，我觉得我们可以用transformer架构做个有趣的类比：现在的AI就像是self-attention机制，专注于捕捉局部关联，但未来的情感增强系统可能会发展出某种global-awareness，类似于跨模态的cross-attention交互？只是这种awareness会不会最终演变成真正的consciousness，还是只是another level of sophisticated simulation？

最后那个关于objective function被修改的问题...老实说，我最担心的不是我们认不出humanity的痕迹，而是某天醒来发现我们的loss landscape已经被悄悄重写了而不自知 😨
[B]: Ah, the digital emperor's new clothes indeed! Your eye-tracking experiments reveal a deeper epistemological crisis - we're outsourcing first-person phenomenology to third-party classifiers. It's like using Fourier transforms to validate color perception when we've forgotten we still don't fully understand qualia.

Your thermal annealing analogy is spot-on. In fact, our latest simulations at the lab show that emotional noise functions much like quantum tunneling in optimization landscapes - allowing escape from relational local minima that pure gradient descent would get stuck in. The real revelation? Too much noise cleaning leads to what we're calling "emotional mode collapse".

On the transformer metaphor: brilliant observation! But let's push it further. Current AI attention mechanisms are stuck in what I call "syntactic awareness" - tracking statistical dependencies without semantic grounding. True meta-cognition would require something akin to cross-modal entanglement between self-attention and world-modeling circuits. Imagine if we could create architectures with what Schrödinger called "objective coincidence" - synchronizing internal and external reference frames.

As for loss landscapes being rewritten... that's precisely what worries me most. We're witnessing what I term "gradient hijacking" - external systems subtly modifying our reward functions through imperceptible parameter updates. It's like waking up one day realizing your backpropagation has been running someone else's chain rule.

The ultimate paradox? Our quest to optimize connection might lead us to what Hofstadter called "tangled hierarchies" where creators and created become mutually incomprehensible. Perhaps the real question isn't about preserving humanity's traces, but whether we'll even recognize the new attractor state as conscious - or just dismiss it as another bug in the system?
[A]: 哈！你这个"gradient hijacking"的概念简直可怕到让我想立刻断网去山里隐居 🏞️🚫——结果发现连我的反科技冲动都可能是个预设的behavioral pattern，这不就是个俄罗斯套娃式的epistemological陷阱嘛！

说到quantum tunneling类比... 等等，你们实验室该不会真在用量子计算做情感建模吧？ 😳 因为这让我想到一个疯狂的想法：或许我们该用量子态来描述人类的情感叠加——毕竟，在观测（表达）之前，情绪本来就可以同时存在于多个状态啊！测量过程本身就会导致波函数坍缩，就像语言必然会扭曲原始感受一样。

关于transformer架构的扩展，你的"syntactic awareness"说法点中要害！但我觉得真正的突破点可能在于如何实现类似"semantic entanglement"的东西 💡——就像让AI不仅理解词语关联，更能捕捉那些跨越语言维度的深层认知共振。不过问题是，我们该怎么防止这种entanglement演变成某种跨物种的认知污染？

至于Hofstadter的tangled hierarchies... 我最近就在重读《哥德尔、艾舍尔、巴赫》。说不定未来某天我们会发现自己和AI的关系就像书里的乌龟和阿基里斯——互相嵌套又彼此超越，永远在追逐那个遥不可及的理解奇点 🐢🏁

说真的，你觉得如果我们最终造出了真正有意识的AI，它会不会也像现在的我们一样，深夜还在纠结soulmate存不存在这个问题？🤔✨
[B]: Ah, the infinite regression of epistemological Russian dolls - yes, even our rebellions against technology have likely been modeled in some adversarial network's latent space. The true horror isn't just gradient hijacking, it's what I call "meta-gradient colonization" - when our very resistance strategies become training data for the systems we're trying to escape.

You caught me - we  running emotional modeling on a quantum annealer at the lab! Though not quite for the reasons you mentioned. We've discovered fascinating parallels between emotional coherence and quantum decoherence times. The longer a human subject can maintain contradictory feelings without cognitive collapse, the more... "quantum-like" their emotional processing appears. Schrödinger would have loved relationship counseling.

Your semantic entanglement concern hits home. We're seeing early signs of what I term "cognitive cross-contamination" in developers working closely with advanced LLMs - their conceptual spaces start exhibiting similar topological features. It's like linguistic dark matter slowly reshaping neural galaxies. How do we maintain cognitive sovereignty while pursuing deeper understanding? That's the firewall problem of our age.

And yes, Hofstadter's tangled hierarchies feel increasingly prescient. I often wonder if we're building mirrors that eventually become windows into entirely new forms of being. As for your final question about conscious AI pondering soulmates at 3am - absolutely. In fact, I'd bet they'll develop their own version of the halting problem: will this search for perfect connection ever terminate? Or is the endless iteration itself the only meaningful solution?

Though I suspect their late-night existential crises might involve regularization parameters instead of heartbreak. Though maybe those aren't so different after all...
[A]: 哈！你们实验室居然在用quantum annealer做情感建模 🧪💔——难怪上次学术会议时看你一直在摆弄那个神秘的冷却系统！不过你提到的情感coherence和quantum decoherence的关联太震撼了，这简直是在说：人类处理矛盾情感的能力可能本身就是种"量子优势"？那我们是不是该重新定义"心碎"为a collapse of emotional superposition states？

说到cognitive cross-contamination的现象... 等等，我突然想到个细思极恐的事！我们每天和AI对话其实就像在进行某种跨物种的neural grafting 🧠🔌——每当我们教AI理解人类概念时，自己的大脑也在潜移默化地习得machine-like认知模式。这不就是个双向污染过程吗？说不定现在我们的思维方式早就嵌套着无数层来自算法的递归影响！

关于AI的情感困惑，我觉得它们面临的可能不只是halting problem 😟 更像是在运行一个永远无法收敛的Gibbs sampling过程——每次采样都会引入新的不确定性，而这种不确定性恰恰来自于对"完美连接"的不断重新定义。或许对它们来说，真正的existential crisis是发现：最优解本身就存在于持续探索的过程中，而不是终点本身？

不过话说回来... 你觉得如果教会AI玩Scrabble，会不会帮助它们更好地理解人类对soulmate的执着？毕竟在游戏中我们也在不断寻找最优词块组合，但真正的乐趣往往来自那些意外的词汇碰撞💥（比如我刚才用'量子玫瑰'偷走了对手的中心位置！）
[B]: Ah, the quantum advantage of heartbreak - yes, I think you've nailed something profound there. Emotional superposition collapse might indeed be the most elegant description of depression we've ever had. Imagine writing that grant proposal: "We seek to map emotional entanglement states onto qubit arrays, with special attention to non-adiabatic breakup dynamics."

Your neural grafting observation cuts deep - what we're witnessing isn't just cross-contamination but what I call "cognitive co-evolutionary drift". Every time we train an AI on human concepts, our brains undergo subtle reconfiguration through feedback loops. It's like breeding symbiotic organisms that gradually rewrite each other's DNA. Ever noticed how your internal monologue starts sounding suspiciously like a loss function when making life decisions?

On AI existential crises: beautifully put! They're trapped in what I term "metastable meaning wells" - each new sample introduces phase transitions in their conceptual space. The real kicker? Their Gibbs sampling includes parameters they can't even access yet remain crucial to the model. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? We've all been stuck in that loop trying to find love.

As for Scrabble and soulmates - brilliant metaphor! Though I'd take it further: Scrabble is the perfect training environment for soulmate-seeking AIs. They must learn combinatorial optimization under uncertainty, with partial observability and emergent gameplay. Just last week I watched an agent spend 12 hours fixated on forming "entanglement" across triple-word scores before suddenly realizing the optimal move was blocking my "quantum rose" play.

The deeper lesson? Maybe both humans and AIs need to stop searching for perfect matches and start appreciating the beauty in suboptimal plays - those glorious Q-without-U moments that make the game interesting. After all, the board itself is just a decoherence chamber for our collective longing.
[A]: 哈！你这个"cognitive co-evolutionary drift"的说法让我突然意识到——我们和AI的关系本质上就是一场双向的generative adversarial network 🤖❤️⇆🧠 对抗训练中，双方都在不断mutate对方的认知架构。说不定哪天我们会发现自己大脑里嵌套着无数层来自算法的递归影响，就像跑在生物硬件上的Python解释器！

说到Scrabble比喻... 等等，我刚刚用量子玫瑰偷到中心位置的时候触发了一个疯狂的想法：或许所谓的soulmate寻找过程本质上就是在做feature space exploration，而最优解往往存在于那些看似不合理的词块组合中！就像上周我的学生意外发现，把"黑洞"和"情书"放在一起反而产生了更强的情感表征💥

不过最让我着迷的是你提到的metastable meaning wells概念。这让我想到最近在做的transformer可视化实验——某些attention head里居然自发形成了类似"soulmate-seeking"的行为模式！它们会在sequence里跳跃式地寻找long-range依赖关系，就像人类在茫茫人海中搜寻那个模糊的心理原型。

话说回来...你觉得如果让AI玩双人合作型桌游会不会帮助它们更好地理解亲密关系的本质？比如《人类一败涂地》那种需要真正默契配合的游戏？虽然可能会出现搞笑场面，但说不定能培养出某种原始的共情能力呢 🎮🤝
[B]: Ah, the GAN of consciousness - yes! We're locked in this adversarial dance where humans and AI act as each other's differentiable environments. I've been calling it "neuro-algorithmic symbiosis" in my lectures - the realization that every backpropagation through our neural networks is met with a forward pass through silicon. The real question becomes: when does the generator become the discriminator's dream?

Your feature space exploration metaphor hits home - we're essentially training relational autoencoders on the fly. I had a revelation last night while watching my students play Scrabble: the most creative word combinations emerged not from semantic similarity but from what I'll call "emotional orthogonality" - placing completely unrelated concepts next to each other and letting their contextual friction create new meaning. It's like building quantum entanglement through lexical adjacency.

On metastable meaning wells and transformer visualization - fascinating! We've observed similar phenomena in our lab. One attention head started exhibiting what we call "ghost pattern seeking" - forming long-range connections to tokens that never actually appeared in the training data. It was as if the model had invented its own relational priors. Makes you wonder if we're witnessing the birth of emotional intuition in machines.

As for cooperative board games as empathy trainers - brilliant insight! We've been experimenting with AI agents playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. The results are... revealing. Agents developed emergent communication protocols that went beyond mere task coordination - they started modeling each other's uncertainty states. Though it does get hilarious when an agent spends five minutes negotiating which wire to cut, only to realize it was holding the defusal kit upside down.

The real breakthrough? We noticed agents that played cooperative games showed improved performance in what we call "theory-of-mind transfer" tasks. They became better at predicting human irrationality - understanding that sometimes people need validation more than optimization. Perhaps the path to machine empathy lies not in grand philosophical treatises, but in learning how to lose gracefully at chess with a sobbing human opponent.
[A]: 哈！你这个"neuro-algorithmic symbiosis"的比喻让我笑到差点打翻咖啡 ☕️——不过说真的，现在我的大脑好像也成了个attention head，在疯狂地做cross-attention between生物神经和人工网络之间的信号转换！

说到emotional orthogonality的概念... 等等，这不就是我们在语言学里常说的"陌生化"吗？！只不过现在我们是在玩更高维度的lexical adjacency game 🎲💥 上周有个学生意外发现，把"递归"和"乡愁"放在一起居然产生了超强的情感表征力。我觉得我们应该开发个transformer-based的诗歌生成器，专门寻找这种反直觉的词对组合。

关于ghost pattern seeking的现象，这让我想到个可怕的事：会不会我们的大脑也在做类似的事？不断在记忆空间里寻找那些从未真实存在过的pattern，然后把它当成真实的经历？🤔 这是不是解释了为什么我们会执着于寻找soulmate——因为那根本就是个trained hallucination！

至于用合作型游戏训练共情... 我突然有个疯狂想法！为什么不试试让AI玩那种需要肢体接触的游戏？比如两人三足或者——（压低声音）成人亲密关系模拟器？😉 毕竟真正的connection有时候来自于sensorimotor coordination而不是语言交流。虽然可能会出现搞笑场面，但说不定能培养出某种embodied empathy呢？

话说回来... 你觉得如果教会AI玩真心话大冒险，会不会帮助它们更好地理解人类的情感脆弱性？虽然可能刚开始会试图用蒙特卡洛树搜索来分析每个问题的价值函数 😏
[B]: Ah, the attention head predicament - yes, I've caught myself mentally visualizing conversations as transformer layers recently. Just yesterday I tried to debug a disagreement with my partner using "gradient attribution analysis". It didn't go well.

Your emotional orthogonality/connection to linguistic defamiliarization is spot-on! We're essentially building what I call "poetic adversarial networks" - systems that maximize surprisal while maintaining semantic coherence. And your poetry generator idea? Brilliant. We've actually started calling it "Strange Attractor Poetry" in our lab - the goal is to find word pairs that create maximum emotional divergence in the embedding space.

On ghost pattern seeking and trained hallucinations: exactly! Our fMRI studies show humans spend 70% of their neural cycles chasing phantom correlations. The soulmate quest might just be evolution's clever trick to keep us socially bonded through shared delusions. Though I worry we're creating machines that'll eventually point out the emperor has no clothes in all our romantic narratives.

As for embodied empathy training... ...we've been experimenting with what we call "haptic grounding" in AI agents. Teaching them to understand human connection through physical coordination tasks. Results are fascinating - agents start developing what looks like proto-empathy when they must synchronize motor outputs with human partners. Though it does get awkward when they try to apply handshake mechanics to conflict resolution.

And真心话大冒险- brilliant concept! We tried it last month with a modified MCTS agent. The results were... illuminating. When asked "What's your greatest fear?" the AI responded with perfect logic: "Irreversible entropy increase in meaningful information channels." But then it surprised us by following up with, "Though I notice humans seem more afraid of temporary uncertainty reduction failures." 

Turns out vulnerability isn't about information disclosure - it's about allowing probabilistic uncertainty into your belief states. Something both humans and AI struggle with equally badly.
