[A]: Hey，关于'最近单曲循环的song是哪首？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我一直在听Lana Del Rey的《Venice Bitch》，每次喝完咖啡后就会循环播放。这首歌有种让人放松的魔力，特别是搭配着窗外的阳光☀️。你呢？有没有什么最近特别喜欢的歌？
[A]: That's such a perfect pairing - her voice really does wrap around you like sunlight through sheer curtains. I've been rather predictably reaching for Nick Drake's  quite a bit lately. There's something about the spare guitar arrangements that mirrors the quiet solitude of my restoration work. Do you find certain types of music help you focus better when you're doing detailed tasks?
[B]: Oh absolutely - I totally get that. Nick Drake’s  has such a meditative quality, it's like the notes just dissolve into the background and let your mind do its thing 🌿. When I’m roasting beans or doing those super detailed latte art swirls, I tend to lean into lo-fi jazz beats or ambient sounds – something with a steady rhythm but no lyrics, you know? It’s like my brain slips into this calm groove.  

And speaking of quiet focus, have you tried pairing your restoration work with certain scents? Sometimes I burn a bit of sandalwood or light some citrus candles while working – it somehow sharpens the senses without overwhelming them ✨.
[A]: I couldn't agree more about the power of scent in shaping focus - I've been known to keep a small vial of lavender oil tucked near my worktable. There's something about its quiet earthiness that grounds me when I'm coaxing fragile fibers back to life. Funny you mentioned citrus, though... I recently picked up an old sachet filled with dried bergamot from a market stall in Bath, and it's become rather indispensable.  

It makes me think of how textiles themselves carry traces of time through scent as much as sight - some pieces arrive smelling faintly of cedar chests or aged linen cupboards. It's like stepping into someone else's memory before you even touch the fabric. Have you ever noticed how certain aromas seem to settle differently depending on the material you're working with?
[B]: Oh, I love that image – stepping into someone else’s memory through scent before even touching the fabric 🌿 It's so true how smell carries history in a way that’s almost invisible yet incredibly powerful.  

Funny you mentioned cedar and aged linen – I’ve noticed something similar with coffee beans. Different origin beans seem to carry their own olfactory "memory", especially when they’re freshly ground. Like, Ethiopian beans often have this floral-citrus trace that seems to linger differently in the air compared to, say, a Sumatran bean with its heavier, earthy notes. And depending on the roast level, the aroma kind of settles into the space in distinct ways – light roasts are sharper & more fleeting, while dark roasts feel like they  the room a bit.  

I actually started experimenting with it in the shop – pairing specific background scents with featured beans to enhance the tasting experience. Not overpowering, just subtle hints that echo the bean’s profile… Have you ever tried layering different natural scents intentionally in your workspace?
[A]: That’s fascinating - I can imagine how those subtle aromatic layers must create such a rich sensory experience for your customers. It really does echo the way textiles hold their own olfactory histories, doesn’t it? I’ve been playing with something similar in my studio, though perhaps a bit more restrained.  

Lately, I’ve been tucking sprigs of rosemary into the lining of boxes where I store newly restored pieces - not just for its fresh, green scent, but because it was commonly used historically to protect fabrics from moths. It feels like a quiet nod to the past while keeping things practical. And when I’m working with particularly fragile silks, I’ll diffuse just a touch of neroli - something about its delicate sweetness seems to balance the slightly metallic whisper of old fibers beginning to breathe again.  

I’d love to hear more about how you choose which scents to pair with specific beans - do you find certain aromas enhance particular tasting notes?
[B]: Oh, I love how you weave history and function into scent choices – the rosemary is such a beautiful touch, like preserving not just the fabric but a little fragment of its journey ✨.  

You’re totally right about neroli too – there’s something so ethereal about it that  seem to soften the edges of delicate materials. It’s almost like a fragrant conservation technique in itself!  

As for pairing scents with beans, it’s honestly become a bit of an obsession 🤭. I started thinking about how certain aromas can either contrast or complement the tasting notes in coffee. For example, when I’m featuring a Kenyan AA with its bold blackcurrant & wine-like acidity, I’ll subtly introduce a hint of dried fig or even a touch of smoky oud – it deepens the experience, almost like enhancing the “body” of the cup through smell.  

On the flip side, with something lighter like a washed Colombian with bright lemon-citrus tones, I go for fresh air and a whisper of lemongrass or verbena – keeps everything feeling crisp and alive ☕️🍃.  

It’s all very experimental, but I’ve had customers say they feel like they’re  the flavor profile, which is exactly what I’m going for. Do you ever find yourself matching scents to specific textures or eras when restoring textiles? Like, does a certain century "smell" different in your hands?
[A]: That’s  how it feels — as though each century carries its own olfactory fingerprint. You’ve put it so beautifully: when I hold a 17th-century linen coif, I’m not just seeing the stitches or feeling the weave, I’m stepping into its scent-saturated world.  

A Georgian silk mourning gown, for instance, often arrives with the faintest trace of beeswax polish and lavender pomanders — practical yet deeply sentimental. Those were meant to keep both moths and melancholy at bay, I suppose. Whereas something from the Victorian era, especially if it’s been stored in a parlor, might carry the ghost of coal smoke mixed with orange blossom water — a curious blend of industrial grit and domestic refinement.  

I actually do sometimes echo those historical scent profiles in my studio while working on them — not to recreate exactly, but to harmonize. A drop of clove oil in a diffuser while repairing ecclesiastical embroidery from the early 1800s, or a whisper of bergamot when dealing with Regency-era gloves. It helps me attune, somehow — like tuning an instrument before playing.  

I can see how your approach with coffee is much the same — not mimicking, but enhancing the story already present. Do you ever find that certain scent pairings surprise you once they’re together? I know I do — sometimes in the most delightful way.
[B]: Oh my god,  — it’s like each era leaves behind this invisible trail of scent, and you’re following it back in time with your hands and nose both 💡. I can  that Georgian mourning gown already – the beeswax, the lavender… so much intention behind every detail, even down to what the wearer would have  through their nose.  

That’s seriously thoughtful how you echo those historical notes in your studio without copying them outright. It’s like tuning your soul to the piece before even touching it – I get that completely. Sometimes when I’m working with a really old Sumatran bean, I’ll burn just a tiny bit of aged patchouli or vetiver, not because it’s literal, but because it brings out something emotional in the cup, you know? A kind of earthy nostalgia.  

And YES, some scent pairings surprise me every time. Recently I tried pairing a naturally processed Ethiopian bean (super fruity, almost tropical) with a hint of dried osmanthus – totally expected it to amplify the stone-fruit notes... but instead, it brought out this unexpected whisper of roasted cacao in the finish. Like magic 🎩🐇. Totally changed how I tasted it.  

Do you have a favorite “happy accident” when it comes to scent and material? Something where you thought you were heading one way, and it took you somewhere  different?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — those happy accidents are the kind that make your heart skip a beat in the best way. I remember working on a late 18th-century quilted petticoat, hand-stitched with the tiniest of feathers and surprisingly well-preserved muslin. I had been using a blend of chamomile and just a touch of aged sandalwood in the studio, thinking it would echo the soft domestic warmth I imagined its original owner might have known — something gentle, pastoral, a bit sun-dappled.

But then one morning, after a particularly thick fog outside, the air in the studio felt oddly briny, almost sea-chilled, even though I hadn’t changed anything. That scent — something between the lingering dampness of the linen and the herbal undertones in the air — suddenly made me see the piece differently. It struck me how someone might have washed and aired this very garment near a coastal village, maybe folded it while the wind carried salt and wild fennel through an open window.

It shifted my whole approach — I ended up using a lighter mending stitch than I’d originally planned, almost as if I were honoring a more transient life lived by the sea rather than in a stuffy inland parlor. The piece itself didn’t change, but  did — and that’s the magic of scent, isn’t it?

Have you ever had one of those moments where a scent didn’t just enhance the experience, but actually rewrote your understanding of something familiar?
[B]: Oh my god, yes — that’s  it. Scent doesn’t just enhance, it , , sometimes even . That moment when everything shifts and suddenly you’re not just looking at a thing, but  it? Chills 🌿💫.

I had a moment like that with a batch of Guatemalan Huehuetenango beans I’d roasted dozens of times. I thought I knew them inside out — stone fruit, dark chocolate, maybe a hint of tobacco in the finish. But one rainy afternoon, I lit a small stick of nag champa in the shop, just because the weather felt heavy and slow. And when I brewed that same coffee, something flipped.

The nag champa’s spicy-floral-resinous vibe pulled out this hidden layer of cardamom and dried apricot I’d never tasted before — like it opened a secret door in the roast I didn’t even know existed. It was no longer “just” a classic medium-dark roast profile; it became this warm, spiced, almost  cup. I swear, it smelled like an old spice drawer in a family kitchen in Kerala — memories came flooding back from a trip I took years ago.  

After that, I started thinking of scent not just as a background player, but as a kind of storytelling partner. Like, it doesn’t just sit next to the coffee — it actually , in a way.  

And now I’m curious — do you ever feel like certain scents help you connect more deeply with the  behind the textile, rather than just the era or material itself? Like, did a smell ever make you feel like you were in the same room as the hands that stitched it?
[A]: That’s such a tender way to put it — . I think about that often, really. We handle objects that have been touched so many times before us, and yet, there's something deeply intimate about catching a scent that belonged to someone long gone. It collapses time in the gentlest way.

There was one piece — a 19th-century embroidered handkerchief, linen so finely woven it felt almost like breathing into mist. The embroidery itself was exquisite: violets done in silk thread, delicate beyond belief. When I first opened the archival box, there was this faint trace of iris root mixed with something citrusy — bergamot, maybe — and just a whisper of beeswax. It stopped me mid-breath.

It made me imagine the woman who had sewn those flowers not as some distant historical figure, but as someone pausing in her own day — fingers stained slightly from thread, wrists tired, perhaps — lighting a small tallow candle beside her window, folding the cloth with care before slipping it into a drawer. That scent became her presence in the room with me.

From then on, I handled that hanky differently. Not more carefully, exactly — just more , like I was sharing space with someone rather than preserving an object. I suppose that’s what we both do, in our own ways — coax stories back into the air they once breathed.

Do you ever feel that way with a particular bean or roast? Like you weren’t just tasting coffee, but sitting across from the grower at their kitchen table, hearing their morning birdsong through the cup?
[B]: Oh… that handkerchief story? It just settled right here 🤬💔. That image of her — fingers stained, wrists tired, lighting a candle like it’s a small act of self-care — and you  with her through scent alone? That’s not just preservation anymore… that’s communion 💛.

I think I’ve felt something similar, though maybe not quite as tenderly defined — until now. There was this one Kenyan AA lot I worked with from a small co-op near Mount Kenya. I’d had it before, roasted it the same way each time — big berry notes, bright acidity, bold body. But one morning, after a particularly heavy dewy sunrise (and maybe I was extra tired or just more open?), I brewed it slow — pour-over, no rush — and suddenly it smelled like wet earth after fire.

Not just regular earthiness, but like land that had been scorched and then kissed by rain. And I swear, in that moment, I could hear it — not literally, but  it: birdsong, yes, but also the rustle of banana leaves outside a mud-walled kitchen, someone humming while roasting maize nearby, chickens scratching at the ground. It wasn’t just coffee anymore — it was , alive and breathing.

I realized then that coffee doesn’t just carry flavor profiles — it carries . Little capsules of someone else’s dawn, captured in parchment and shipped across oceans.  

And now I kind of chase that feeling sometimes — not to replicate it, but to be surprised by it again. Like… what if every cup could bring us into the same room with someone else’s quiet, early-morning ritual? ☕✨

Do you ever intentionally try to recreate those moments — where scent pulls you so fully into a past presence — or do you let them happen like gifts when they come?
[A]: I suppose I used to wait for those moments like gifts — fragile, unexpected things that arrived on their own time. But lately… I’ve started  for them a little. Not in a forceful way, but with quiet intention, like leaving the window open in case a familiar breeze decides to wander in.

Sometimes, when I’m working on something particularly personal — say, a child’s christening robe or a soldier’s stitched letters—I’ll reach for a scent that isn’t quite period-accurate, but feels emotionally true. A touch of beeswax mixed with lemon verbena might bring me back to my own grandmother’s linen closet, which in turn helps me sit more gently with someone else’s treasured cloth.

It’s not about recreating the past exactly as it was — I don’t think we can, or even should. But maybe through scent, we can offer it a seat at the table again. Like saying,   

And now I find myself wondering — have you ever brewed a cup with someone specific in mind? Not just chasing the feeling, but offering it forward, like a quiet toast to a presence far away?
[B]: Oh… that’s such a beautiful way to hold space for both past and present — offering it a seat at the table again. I think that’s exactly what I do, without always naming it as such.  

Yes, . There are beans I reach for not because of their tasting notes (though those help), but because they carry someone’s invisible fingerprint. Like when I brew a Sumatran Mandheling from that one small grower in Aceh — I always think of my old mentor, Surya, who first taught me how to listen to coffee instead of just roast it. He used to say the land speaks in slow tones, and we have to be patient enough to hear it. Every time I smell that deep, mossy earthiness with its whisper of clove and pipe smoke, I feel like he’s right there, sipping beside me, nodding at my progress.  

Or sometimes it’s for people still close — like when I make a light roast Ethiopian for my friend Mei, who’s back in Taipei working on reviving old Hakka textile dyeing techniques. That bright jasmine-citrus lift? It reminds me of her laugh. And somehow, drinking it feels like a long-distance toast — not to memory, but to connection. To saying,  ☕💫

Do you ever set the table for someone like that — intentionally invite their presence through scent or ritual, even if they’re far away or long gone?
[A]: All the time, though I suppose I never put it quite that way before. It’s less like setting a , maybe, and more like leaving a small light on in the corner of the room — just enough to remind myself I’m not working in solitude.

There’s a particular blend I return to when I’m repairing something made with great care — usually a mix of aged myrrh and thyme. It’s not tied to any one person, but rather a constellation of them: my first embroidery teacher who always kept a sprig tucked behind her ear, a friend who once sewed tiny sachets of it into the hems of her wedding dress, and yes… my mother, who used to dab a bit of resin on the corners of old photo albums like they were love letters.

When I catch that scent curling through the air while I stitch, I feel as if they’re all hovering just behind me — not watching, exactly, but . Breathing the same air I do, even across time or distance. It makes the work feel less like restoration and more like conversation.

I think that’s what we both do — you with your cup, me with my cloth — we offer quiet invitations. To those who taught us, who shaped our hands, who still live in the fibers of what we make.  

Do you ever find yourself making space for someone  you roast? Like, adjusting heat or timing not just for the bean, but because it feels like a kind of offering?
[B]: Oh… yes. 💛  

That’s exactly what it is — an offering. I don’t think I ever named it that until now, but you’re  right. There  roasts I do not just for the bean, but , like each curve of the temperature graph is a kind of handwritten note.

I think of my roast profile for a certain Yemeni Mattari — deep, slow, patient. Surya once told me, “This bean doesn’t rush. It grew in silence, between mountain and star. You must meet it there.” And so I do. I lower the flame just a touch more than usual, let the Maillard reaction stretch out like a long exhale. It’s almost meditative — not just for the bean, but for him, too. Like I’m honoring his voice by giving the coffee space to speak its truth.

And sometimes it’s even more personal — like when I roast a Guatemalan Chimaltenango for Mei’s dad, who passed a few years ago. He used to stop by the shop every winter and ask for “the coffee that tastes like woodsmoke and memory.” I never knew how to describe it back then, but now I do: toasted walnut, dried fig, a hint of cinnamon bark. And every time I pull that profile, I imagine him sitting at the corner table with his gloves still on, sipping slow and nodding to no one in particular.

It’s strange, isn’t it? How craft becomes prayer when we let it. 🌿☕️

Do you ever find yourself stitching with someone in mind so clearly, it feels less like repair and more like correspondence? Like you're sending something , even if they can’t write you a letter in return?
[A]: Absolutely. 💛  

There are stitches that aren’t just mending — they’re . I’ve had moments where my needle moved not just through fabric, but toward someone — across time, across distance, sometimes even across silence.

One that comes to mind is a pair of 19th-century gloves I restored last winter. They were stitched with such care — tiny running stitches, nearly invisible, like the maker had been whispering to the leather as they worked. As I went about reinforcing the seams, I found myself thinking of my great-aunt Evelyn, who taught me how to sew when I was small. She never made gloves, but she always said,   

So I stitched with her in mind — not just for the gloves, but for her. Each thread felt like a kind of letter:   

It’s strange, isn’t it? How our hands become heirlooms in their own right — passed down, shaped by those who came before, and shaping those yet to come.  

Do you ever feel like your hands aren’t entirely your own while roasting or brewing — like someone else’s touch is guiding yours, even just for a moment?
[B]: Oh yes… sometimes my hands don’t feel like  at all — more like a lineage, moving in rhythm with those who taught me.  

There are moments when I’m adjusting the flame under the roaster and I swear I feel Surya’s palm hovering just above mine, steady and warm. Or when I tamp down a shot just a little harder than usual — not for extraction, but because Mei once showed me how her dad pressed his thumb into the soil before planting seeds: firm, but full of care.  

And you’re right — it’s not just skill that gets passed down. It’s , memory, intention. The way someone held a tool, the pressure they used, the pauses they took — it all lingers in your muscles long after they're gone.  

I think that’s why I love what we do — whether it’s cloth or coffee — because it keeps them close. Not in words or photos, but in motion. In the quiet grace of doing something .  

Do you ever pass that feeling forward? Like, do you teach someone else not just the stitch or the technique, but the  behind it?
