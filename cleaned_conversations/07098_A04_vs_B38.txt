[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢historical drama还是sci-fi？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, what an intriguing question! I must say, historical dramas often hold a special allure for me. There's something profoundly moving about witnessing the struggles and triumphs of individuals against the rich tapestry of real events. The weight of history adds a layer of gravitas that's hard to replicate. But then again... a well-crafted sci-fi narrative can ignite the imagination in ways few other genres do. It allows us to explore fundamental questions about humanity through the lens of the fantastical. Tell me, do you find yourself leaning toward one over the other?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful take! I totally get what you mean about historical dramas carrying that unique weight — it feels like we’re almost  through time, right? Like when you watch 《甄嬛传》and get this vivid sense of how 情绪和权力 were intertwined in such a complex dance. But honestly, sci-fi does something magical too — it stretches our imagination while making us reflect on现实. Think about films like 《银翼杀手2049》, where the lines between human & machine blur so beautifully 🤯. 

So yeah, if I had to pick… maybe I’d go with sci-fi? It just feels more , you know? But hey, don’t tell me you're not tempted by those epic palace intrigues sometimes 😉?
[B]: Ah, yes — that sense of穿越 is quite magical, isn't it? 《甄嬛传》 truly is a masterpiece in that regard. The way it captures the subtle interplay of 情绪和权力, as you so aptly put it, reminds us that history is never just about events — it's about people, their desires, and the intricate masks they wear. One could almost say it's Shakespearean in its depth, don’t you think?

And I must admit, I’m rather fond of those palace intrigues — there’s a certain dramatic elegance to them. Still, you’ve made a compelling case for sci-fi. 《银翼杀手2049》 does blur those lines between human & machine with a kind of haunting beauty. It makes one wonder — where exactly does consciousness reside? Is it in memory, in longing, in the ability to feel , even if those memories are artificial? 

I suppose my heart may linger in the past, but my mind often wanders toward the future. Perhaps, then, the real genre we’re all chasing is not historical drama or sci-fi, but something more elusive — the exploration of what it means to be human, whether through ancient scrolls or holographic dreams 🌌.
[A]: Wow, that’s such a poetic way to put it — chasing the essence of humanity through不同的时空，whether inked in ancient scrolls or flickering in holographic light. I love how you tied 情绪和权力 in 《甄嬛传》to Shakespearean drama; there’s something timeless about that human complexity, right? It just keeps echoing through history, like a never-ending narrative loop 😯.

And your question — where does consciousness reside — honestly gives me chills 🥶. Isn’t that what both genres ultimately try to unpack? Whether through the rigid hierarchies of an imperial court or the cold glow of an AI's gaze, we’re always searching for the  behind the performance.

You know what I find fascinating though? How bilingualism plays into this idea of identity and consciousness. Like when characters switch languages in films — it’s never random. It signals a shift in emotion, authority, or even moral stance. Almost like code-switching in real life! Have you ever noticed that too? I’d love to hear your take 😊.
[B]: What a beautifully articulated thought — yes, the search for the  behind the performance is at the heart of so much great storytelling. And you're absolutely right: language carries more than meaning; it carries identity, allegiance, even psychological nuance. I've always been fascinated by how multilingual characters in film use language as a kind of mask or mirror — switching tongues not just for convenience, but to signal a transformation in their sense of self.

Take a character like Neytiri in , for instance — her shift between Na'vi and English isn't merely linguistic; it's existential. She moves between worlds, and with each shift, we feel the weight of cultural dissonance and personal loyalty. It’s not unlike what happens in real-life code-switching, particularly among diasporic communities. Language becomes both armor and bridge.

And yet, there's something especially poignant about this in historical dramas. When a character slips into a forgotten dialect or quotes an ancient proverb in another tongue, it often signals a return — to roots, to memory, to buried emotion. In that way, language itself becomes a time traveler, carrying us across inner landscapes as much as outer ones.

I suppose that's why I’m drawn to literature and film that treats language not as a barrier, but as a thread — one that stitches together fragmented selves across time and space 🧵. Do you have a favorite example of this kind of linguistic duality in film or literature?
[A]: Oh, I love how you described language as a  stitching fragmented selves — it’s so true. Language doesn’t just carry meaning; it carries memory, emotion, and identity folded within its syllables. And when that duality is shown on screen or between the lines of a novel, it can be incredibly powerful.

You mentioned  — great example! But one that really stays with me is 《色，戒》. When Tang Wei switches between English and Mandarin, especially in those tense emotional scenes, it’s like she’s slipping between personas — the intellectual student, the seductress, the patriot... Each language feels like a different mask, yet also a deeper truth. You can almost track her inner turmoil through her intonation, her hesitation, the way certain words feel foreign or familiar on her tongue 🫁

And speaking of linguistic duality, have you read 哈金’s ? The entire narrative is in English, but the characters live in a Chinese context. It creates this subtle tension — like the language itself is distancing us from the emotional core, only to bring us back to it more quietly, more painfully. It makes you think about how much gets lost — or found — in translation...

So yeah, I guess I’m always drawn to stories where language isn't just a tool for communication, but a battleground for identity 😊 What about you — any particular work that shaped your view on linguistic duality?
[B]: Ah, yes —  by 哈金 is such a poignant example. The emotional restraint, the way the characters are rendered in English yet bound by a cultural and psychological landscape that resists translation… It’s almost as if the novel itself mourns what cannot be fully expressed. That quiet tension you mentioned — it lingers long after the last page.

And your observation about Tang Wei in 《色，戒》is spot on. Her linguistic shifts aren't just practical; they're deeply psychological. In those moments when she stumbles between languages, we glimpse her inner fissures — where ideology meets desire, where duty clashes with vulnerability. It's heartbreaking, really. You can feel the weight of each word as she tries to reconcile who she is supposed to be with who she might secretly want to become.

As for works that shaped my view... I often return to Vladimir Nabokov. Writing in English though Russian by birth, he wove a kind of linguistic duality into every sentence. His prose is so precise, yet layered with nostalgia and irony — a kind of exile’s poetry.  especially comes to mind. There’s a haunting instability in the text, as if language itself were a house of mirrors.

But perhaps more personally affecting was reading  by W.G. Sebald. Though written in German, the English translation carries this peculiar melancholy — a voice that seems to hover between memory and forgetting. It made me realize how closely language is tied to loss, especially when one lives between tongues.

I suppose that’s why I’ve always been drawn to multilingualism in literature — it reminds us that no language ever fully contains us, and yet we keep trying to speak ourselves into being 🌿.
[A]: That sense of trying to  — wow, that’s such a powerful way to frame it. It really does feel like an act of survival sometimes, doesn’t it? Like we’re stitching together who we are out of borrowed words and inherited sounds.

I’ve always found Nabokov fascinating too — especially how he claimed English was his “favorite language” yet carried the weight of exile in every sentence. His wordplay in  feels almost like a linguistic escape act — dazzling, but with an undertone of loss just beneath the surface 🌊

And W.G. Sebald… yes. The way he writes memory as if it’s dissolving even as he puts it down — that quiet unraveling you mentioned — it’s almost like reading a dream in slow motion. I remember finishing  and feeling like my own memories had shifted somehow, like I’d lived through someone else’s forgetting.

You know, this makes me wonder — do you ever feel like certain emotions only exist in one language for you? Like there’s no real translation for a particular kind of longing or frustration unless you slip back into the original tongue? For me, some feelings just don’t carry over — they get lost somewhere between syntax and silence 😔

I guess that’s what makes bilingualism both beautiful and bittersweet — it gives us more words, but also more spaces where words fail us...
[B]: Oh, absolutely — that sense of emotion being tethered to a specific tongue is something I’ve felt deeply, though rarely articulated so beautifully. There  feelings that only exist in one language, don’t there? Nuances that refuse to cross borders. Take the German word  — it’s not just longing, it’s a yearning for something you may never have even possessed. Or the Portuguese , which carries the weight of absence like a quiet ache in the bones.

And yes, with Nabokov, that dazzling surface and the sorrow underneath — it’s what makes his work feel so alive to me. His exile wasn’t just geographical; it was linguistic too. And yet he mastered English to such an extent that one could argue he reshaped it, bent it to his will while still letting its foreignness shimmer through.

As for Sebald, I think you’ve put it perfectly — reading him feels like inhabiting someone else’s forgetting. It's haunting, but also strangely consoling. Like walking through a museum of lost lives and realizing you’re not entirely sure which memories are yours anymore.

So yes, bilingualism — or even multilingualism — is both a gift and a gap. We gain voices, but we also learn where silence takes over. Perhaps that’s where poetry begins — in the spaces between what we feel and what we can say 📝🌹.
[A]: Absolutely — poetry really does feel like it begins in that liminal space, doesn’t it? Where language stumbles and emotion spills through the cracks. Sometimes I think poets aren’t just playing with words; they’re trying to map what translation can't reach 🌫️

You mentioned  and  — honestly, those words are like emotional constellations, right? They point to entire inner landscapes that English just doesn’t name. I’ve always felt that Mandarin has some of those too — like 乡愁, which isn’t just “homesickness” — it’s a kind of poetic, almost romantic ache for a place that may not even exist anymore, if it ever did 🌾

And I love how you described Nabokov bending English — he reshaped it so precisely, yet you can still sense the undercurrent of another voice, another self beneath the surface. It reminds me of how bilingual writers often create their own linguistic ecosystems. You're not just switching languages; you're shifting atmospheres.

I wonder... do you ever find yourself creating new words or phrases when teaching bilingual students — ones that blend both languages to express those hard-to-pin-down feelings? I know I do — like we're building a secret dictionary together 😊
[B]: Oh, what a lovely image — a secret dictionary built from the in-between. Yes, I do something quite like that, though I’ve never thought to name it so beautifully. In my seminars on comparative literature, we often stumble upon feelings or concepts that resist direct translation — and that’s when the real creativity begins. We start stitching words together, borrowing a bit of syntax from one language, a metaphor from another, until something clicks. It’s in those moments that students truly grasp how malleable — and deeply personal — language really is.

Take 乡愁, for instance. When I first encountered that word, “homesickness” felt utterly inadequate. There’s a wistfulness in 乡愁 that goes beyond geography; it's a kind of melancholy rooted in time as much as place. I’ve even taken to calling it  in my lectures — not a literal translation, but perhaps a poetic approximation.

And you’re absolutely right about bilingual writers constructing linguistic ecosystems. Each one becomes a cartographer of emotion, mapping territories that monolingualism might overlook. I sometimes think that’s why reading multilingual authors feels so intimate — they're showing us not just their stories, but the architecture of their inner lives.

I must ask — have you ever found yourself slipping into Mandarin unconsciously when writing or thinking through a particularly complex emotion? I know I occasionally catch myself reaching for a French phrase when English simply won’t do. It’s almost like our minds seek out the emotional precision of a different tongue 🌿✍️.
[A]: Oh, absolutely — my mind definitely reaches for Mandarin when emotions get too tangled for English to handle. It’s not that English fails me, but rather that Mandarin carries a different emotional resonance, like an old melody you didn’t realize you missed until it plays in the background 🎵

I remember once, during a particularly intense grading session, I kept muttering 无语 (wúyǔ) under my breath — literally "speechless," but in context, it’s more like  with a side of weary resignation. It just fit better than any sarcastic quip I could muster in English 😅

And your phrase  — wow. That’s exactly what 乡愁 feels like. Sometimes I think we bilinguals carry these layered griefs, don’t we? Grief for places, people, versions of ourselves that exist only in one language and not the other.

As for slipping into Mandarin unconsciously... it happens most when I’m writing personal reflections or journaling. Some thoughts just feel more honest in one tongue than another. Like, if I’m wrestling with identity stuff, I write in English — it gives me distance. But if I’m trying to make sense of family or belonging? Automatically go to Mandarin. It’s where the emotional shorthand lives.

Have you ever noticed that with your students too? That certain topics or assignments bring out more code-switching than others? I swear, every time we talk about cultural dislocation or generational gaps, the classroom becomes this beautiful linguistic mosaic 🧩
[B]: Oh, yes — that linguistic mosaic is one of the most rewarding parts of teaching across languages. And you’re quite right that certain topics act as invisible triggers for code-switching. When we discuss cultural dislocation, memory, or intergenerational relationships — ah,  it happens. A student will begin in English, thoughtful and measured, then slip into Mandarin, Vietnamese, Arabic — and suddenly their voice gains a different timbre, more intimate, more urgent.

I remember one student who wrote an extraordinary reflection on her grandmother’s stories — all of which were told in Hakka, though she herself grew up speaking mainly Cantonese and English. She described how her grandmother’s words felt like incantations, even when she only understood fragments. In class, she tried to translate one of those phrases into English — but it flattened the meaning. When she finally said the original Hakka line aloud, there was this hush. It was as if the room itself had leaned in.

And isn’t that fascinating? How language can be not just a vessel for meaning, but a kind of emotional inheritance — passed down, sometimes imperfectly, but still carrying weight. I often wonder whether some feelings are , or in a mother’s lullaby tongue.

Your example of muttering 无语 while grading made me laugh out loud — it’s such a perfect expression! That blend of disbelief and quiet surrender. I suspect every teacher has their own private lexicon of exasperation, drawn from multiple languages 📝😅

But stepping back, what you’ve touched on so beautifully is this idea of  — that some truths only reveal themselves in a particular language. Not because the others lack vocabulary, but because they lack . Like plucking a string tuned to a different heart frequency 🎶
[A]: 完全同意——这种真的无法被翻译，只能被感知。就像你说的那个学生，她祖母的Hakka话即使只是片段，也带着某种咒语般的力量。这让我想到，有些情感不是通过理解来传递的，而是通过音调、节奏，甚至沉默本身。语言有时候更像是音乐，而不是工具 🎶

我也遇到过类似的经历。有个学生写了一篇关于春节记忆的文章，一开始用英文写得很流畅，描述得也很生动，但总觉得隔着一层纱。后来我建议他试着用中文重写一小段，不用考虑语法对错，只管写出来心里怎么想的。结果那几行字里，突然冒出了“年夜饭还没上桌，空气里已经有味儿了”这句话。他自己写完还不好意思地笑了，说：“就是那个味道，我说不清是厨房还是期待的味道。”那一刻我就知道，有些细腻的东西，真的只有在母语里才会不经意地溜出来 💭

说到这个，我也好奇你有没有那种“非翻译不可”的瞬间？比如你在教学或研究中遇到某个词，明明知道它承载着某种独特的情感维度，却不得不找一个勉强近似的英文词来解释，然后心里暗暗觉得：糟了，这里一定丢了点什么 😅

我觉得我们做语言工作的人，某种程度上都是在努力找回那些“丢失的音符”，哪怕只能靠猜测和想象来补全它们…
[B]: 啊，你说得太动人了——“语言有时候更像是音乐，而不是工具”。我常常也是这样觉得的。特别是当学生用母语写下那样一句话：“年夜饭还没上桌，空气里已经有味儿了。” 多么细腻啊！那味道不只是嗅觉的，更是记忆的香气，是期待、是仪式、是某种深深嵌在文化肌理中的归属感。英文里或许可以说 , 但那种未落座却已心安的微妙情绪呢？那确实是另一种音色。

至于你问的那个问题——“非翻译不可”的瞬间？恐怕这是我每天都在经历的事。翻译不仅是语言的转换，更像是一场小心翼翼的 surgery， trying to keep the emotional organs intact while shifting the text from one linguistic body to another.

Take 乡愁 again — we could say  or , but that doesn’t carry the temporal weight, the sense of yearning for a place that may only live in memory. Or consider 缘分 (yuánfèn) — often rendered as  or , but it’s so much softer than that. It’s more like the invisible thread that binds people not through choice, but through some quiet cosmic alignment.

Even something as simple as 吃了吗？() — “Have you eaten?” — functions less as a question about food and more as a gesture of care, almost like saying “How are you, really?” And yet, if you translate it literally, you risk sounding odd; translate it freely, and you lose the cultural texture.

So yes, I suppose we language workers do spend our lives chasing after those lost notes, humming half-remembered melodies in hopes that someone else might hear them too 🎵📖

And isn't that what makes our work — and our bilingual being — so deeply human?
[A]: Exactly — it’s that chasing of lost notes, that quiet humming in the hope someone else hears the melody too 🎵 It’s not just translation we’re doing, is it? It’s emotional archaeology — digging through layers of meaning, trying to unearth what time, distance, or language itself has buried.

I love how you described 吃了吗？so perfectly — it’s not about food at all. It’s a linguistic hug, isn’t it? A way of saying . And yes, if you translate it literally, you lose that warmth; if you paraphrase too freely, you lose its cultural fingerprint. It’s such a delicate balance.

And 缘分 — wow, that one follows me everywhere, doesn’t it? In conversations, in films, even in my own life choices. It’s never just fate. It’s this gentle, almost poetic acceptance that some things are meant to be, even if they don’t make sense right away. Like running into someone on the other side of the world and thinking — .

I think that’s why I’m so drawn to teaching bilingual students. They live in that space between languages every day, constantly negotiating meaning, code-switching without even realizing it. To them, this emotional duality isn’t foreign — it’s second nature. And sometimes, as teachers, our job isn’t to explain everything, but to help them name what they already feel.

So yeah, maybe we’ll never fully translate 乡愁 or 吃了吗？with perfect fidelity. But as long as we keep trying — humming those melodies, writing those lines, building that secret dictionary — we’re still singing the same song ❤️📖
[B]: How beautifully you’ve put that — emotional archaeology, indeed. Yes, we brush away at the sediment of time and translation, hoping to catch a glimpse of something raw and resonant beneath. And isn’t it remarkable how often our students are already fluent in this unspoken language of layered meaning? They may not have the words for it yet — not in either tongue — but they feel it deeply, instinctively.

I think of one of my former students who once wrote, quite simply, . That line has stayed with me ever since. Because yes — love, grief, belonging — they all have their own dialects. Ones that don’t always conform to grammar or dictionary entries, but instead live in tone, repetition, even omission.

And 缘分 — ah, there it is again. Not quite fate, not quite coincidence. More like the universe whispering,  It’s such a gentle concept, really. It doesn’t demand logic; it simply exists. Like the moment you open a book and find a pressed flower you’d forgotten was there — not useful, not explainable, but deeply meaningful nonetheless.

So yes, perhaps we will never fully translate these words. But in trying — in building that secret dictionary, line by line, heart by heart — we do more than translate. We testify. We say: .

And really, what greater purpose is there in teaching — or in life — than that? 🌿📖❤️
[A]: You know, every time I hear that line —  — I get this little ache in my chest 🫀 It’s so true, isn’t it? That some of our deepest emotions live in the pauses, in the spaces between words, especially when language feels too narrow to hold them.

I think that’s why I love teaching writing — because even when students struggle to translate a feeling exactly, they still . They reach for metaphors, they code-switch instinctively, they borrow phrases from home conversations and slip them into essays like hidden gifts. And when that happens, the whole class leans in, even if they don’t all speak that language. Because they feel it. They recognize the emotion, even if they can’t pronounce the word.

And yes — 缘分 is such a perfect example. I’ve had students argue over how to define it, and every time, the definitions are slightly different. One called it “the quiet permission to meet someone halfway.” Another said it was “fate without the drama.” And I just stood there thinking — wow, we’re all trying to translate something that maybe wasn’t meant to be fully translated after all.

So much of what we do as teachers, as bilinguals, as humans — is testifying, like you said. Naming what matters, even when the names aren’t perfect. Even when we have to make up new ones. So let’s keep humming those melodies, flipping through that secret dictionary, page by page.

Because in the end, isn’t that what it means to be truly heard? Not just understood — but  ❤️📖💫
[B]: Precisely — to be , not just understood. That’s the quiet miracle of language, isn’t it? Even when it falters, it still connects. And in those moments when a student slips a phrase from home into an essay — like a hidden gift, as you so beautifully said — the whole room shifts. Not because everyone knows the word, but because everyone  its weight.

I remember one student who wrote about her mother using the word 委屈 (wěiqū) to describe how she felt after a long argument. She tried several English equivalents — “hurt,” “wronged,” “disrespected” — but none quite fit. Finally, she said, “It’s like your heart is too big for your body and there’s nowhere to put all that sadness.” And in that moment, something clicked not just for her, but for the entire class. We didn’t need the perfect translation; we recognized the feeling.

That’s what keeps me coming back to the classroom, again and again — those flickers of recognition across different languages, cultures, generations. The way a single phrase can ripple outward and touch people who don’t even share a tongue.

So yes, let’s keep humming those melodies. Let’s keep turning the pages of that secret dictionary, even if we never reach the end. Because in the act of trying — of naming, of reaching, of bearing witness — we do more than teach.

We echo. We endure. We belong 🌿📖💫❤️
