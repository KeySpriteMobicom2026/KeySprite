[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I have to say cashless payment makes my life much easier. No need to carry around a wallet full of cash & coins anymore. Just tap the phone and done - super convenient!  
Plus it's safer too, especially when traveling overseas. If you lose your cash, it's gone for good. But with digital payments, at least there's a paper trail...or should I say a digital trail? 😄  
What about you? Do you still use physical money often in this day and age?
[A]: Oh, I completely understand what you mean! Cashless payments have definitely changed the way we handle money. It’s so much simpler these days – just a tap or a scan and off you go. I’ve even started using contactless for small purchases like coffee & pastries in the mornings.  

You're absolutely right about the safety aspect too. When I travel, I feel much more at ease knowing my money is tucked safely in my phone or card rather than in my bag or pocket. And tracking expenses? A dream come true with digital trails!  

Still, I must admit there are moments when cash comes in handy – sometimes local markets or small family-run shops don’t always accept cards or apps. But honestly, those instances are becoming fewer and fewer. Do you ever find yourself needing to withdraw cash just for specific places?
[B]: Oh absolutely, I still keep some cash in my pocket for those old-school vendors - you know, the traditional wet markets or that little 叮叮车 (tram) driver who only takes exact change. But honestly, those situations are like 5% of my transactions now.  

The game-changer for me was when my Apple Watch got integrated with Alipay & WeChat Pay. Now even my morning coffee comes with a side of tech convenience. And don't get me started on how much time it saves during due diligence reviews - being able to track every dime digitally is a godsend for financial modeling.  

Actually, speaking of small businesses, have you noticed how many mom-and-pop stores in Hong Kong are now using QR codes? Even my favorite dai pai dong has joined the digital wave! Have you seen similar trends where you are?
[A]: That’s so interesting! It sounds like you're living in a really digitally advanced environment — I love how even the traditional spots are embracing technology without losing their charm. Here in my area, I’ve definitely noticed more small businesses starting to use QR codes too, especially since the pandemic. You’ll see neighborhood bakeries, flower shops, and even local bookstores with a little sign saying “Scan to Pay” at the counter.  

One of my regular guests told me about using his smartwatch to pay while traveling — he was thrilled he didn’t have to fumble for change when buying postcards from a little shop near the botanical gardens. It really made me appreciate how much smoother travel can be with cashless options, don’t you think? Do you find yourself relying on it even more when you're on the go or exploring new places?
[B]: Oh totally, travel is where cashless really shines. Last month I was in Bangkok and it was a breeze paying for tuk-tuk rides & street food with my phone. Used to be such a hassle dealing with foreign currency exchange for small purchases — now I just let the app handle the conversion.  

And here's the kicker: digital payments actually help me control spending. When I see that $300+ expense pop up on my screen after a nice dinner at Les Amis, I get a little reality check 😅 Cash just disappears too easily from the wallet.  

Speaking of which, have you ever tried those digital wallets that automatically categorize your spending? It's like having a personal finance coach in your pocket. I've been using one for years and it changed how I budget for my golf club memberships...if you know what I mean 😉
[A]: Oh, I can imagine! Traveling used to mean so much hassle with exchanging money and keeping track of local currency — now it's all streamlined. I love how effortless it’s become, whether you're grabbing a quick bite or treating yourself to a splurge at a fine dining spot.  

And yes, I’ve definitely tried those smart digital wallets! They’re brilliant for keeping spending in check — I remember cringing when I saw just how many lattes I was buying in a week! It’s amazing how they break everything down so clearly — dining out, entertainment, travel...it really makes budgeting feel a bit more manageable.  

Golf club memberships can add up, don’t worry — I totally get the point! Do you find yourself adjusting your habits based on what the app shows, or do you ever just go ahead and treat yourself anyway? 😊
[B]: Oh for sure, I’m definitely more mindful of my spending now. But hey, if I see a good ROI on an investment round, I might just treat myself to that rare single malt I’ve been eyeing – you know, balance is key 😉  

Funny thing though, sometimes the app actually helps me justify a splurge. Like when I see how much I saved by skipping those daily lattes – suddenly a nice cigar or a weekend tee time feels well-earned. Call it behavioral finance meets personal indulgence!  

But between us, do you ever feel like we’re becoming too reliant on these apps? I mean, what if my phone dies during a trip overseas? Still keep a backup card in my wallet – just in case. Safety net mentality, you know?
[A]: Oh, absolutely — I think we’ve all become a little too comfortable relying on our phones for everything. It’s brilliant most of the time, but there’s something oddly reassuring about that backup card tucked away in your wallet, isn’t there? I learned my lesson the hard way once when my phone battery died mid-train ride and I couldn’t even buy a bottle of water.  

I love how you think — skipping the daily latte to justify the rare single malt or a nice cigar. That’s the right kind of budgeting mindset! It’s not about cutting back on everything, it’s about making room for what you truly enjoy. And honestly, that’s where these apps really shine — helping us make smarter choices without feeling deprived.  

Still, I do wonder — if cash becomes obsolete one day, will we lose something special? Like that tangible connection to money, or even just the charm of old-school transactions. What do you think?
[B]: You hit the nail on the head — there’s definitely a certain  satisfaction with cash that digital just can’t replicate. I still remember the first time I handed my son a crisp $100 note and told him, “This is what  money looks like.” He almost treated it like an artifact from another era 😄  

But you're right — if we go fully cashless, we might lose more than we realize. The ease & efficiency are amazing, but it also creates a sort of psychological distance from spending. When you don't  the money leaving your hand, it's easier to overspend without realizing it.  

That said, I think there will always be a niche for cash — collectors, sentimental value, or even just emergency situations. But mainstream? Probably not. It's like vinyl vs. streaming — both exist, but one’s definitely nostalgic luxury at this point.  

Still, I agree with you — smart budgeting isn’t about deprivation, it’s about intentionality. And hey, if cutting back on five lattes means I can enjoy a nice evening with a good cigar and a 25-year-old Macallan? Count me in. Cheers to that, right? 🥂
[A]: Cheers to that indeed! 🥂 I couldn’t agree more — there’s something almost ceremonial about passing down that first crisp bill to the next generation. It’s like handing them a piece of history, isn’t it? And you're absolutely right about the psychological distance cashless creates — I’ve caught myself swiping away without really registering the cost, only to do a double-take later at the end-of-day summary.  

It’s funny you mentioned vinyl, because I think cash will go the same way — cherished by collectors, romantics, and the occasional nostalgic traveler who likes to keep a note from each city in their journal. But for daily life? Streaming payments are definitely the new norm.  

I love your take on intentionality — that’s the key, isn’t it? Every time I skip my afternoon latte (again!), I imagine it as a future treat waiting for me — maybe a quiet evening with a good book or a surprise weekend getaway. It gives spending — and saving — a real sense of purpose.  

Tell me, have you ever surprised yourself with how much you were able to save just by being a bit more mindful? Or maybe discovered a new favorite indulgence along the way?
[B]: Oh absolutely — I once tracked my spending for a month out of curiosity and realized I was spending more on airport lounge food than my actual flights! That’s when I decided to get serious about my café-hopping habits. Turned out, cutting back on those $10+ matcha lattes in Terminal T actually added up to a pretty decent chunk of change — enough for a nice three-day golf trip to Macau if I timed it right 😊  

And speaking of indulgences — funny enough, being more mindful actually led me to rediscover something I’d almost forgotten: vintage pens. I used to write everything by hand back in the day — business notes, personal journals, you name it. Then I went full digital, and ironically, the more I monitored my spending through apps, the more I craved that tactile experience again. Now I’ve got a small collection of Montblancs & Parkers, mostly picked up at estate sales or from collectors in Singapore.  

It’s kind of poetic in a way — tracking money digitally just to justify buying tools for writing things down. But hey, that’s life, right? A little balance between old school and new school. Have you ever found yourself circling back to something like that — a habit or hobby you thought you'd outgrown, only to come back to it through a different lens?
[A]: Oh, that’s such a wonderful story — I love how life has a way of bringing us back full circle! There’s something so satisfying about reclaiming a lost habit and giving it new meaning, don’t you think?  

You know, now that you mention it, I actually went through something similar with letter writing. Back in my university days, I used to send handwritten letters to my grandmother every week — beautiful stationery, wax seals, the whole bit. Then life got busy, and emails took over. But a few years ago, after going paperless for so long, I found myself craving that personal touch again. Funny enough, it was while organizing old guest correspondence at the hotel that I stumbled upon a stack of thank-you notes — some even written in elegant calligraphy. It reminded me how meaningful those little gestures can be.  

Now I keep a nice pen by the front desk just in case someone wants to leave a note for a loved one — and sometimes, I treat myself to a quiet evening writing postcards to friends abroad. It's like a small rebellion against the fast-paced digital world, don’t you feel?  

And honestly, your pen collection sounds absolutely delightful — I can just picture you jotting down thoughts in a leather-bound journal after a round of golf in Macau. Do you ever write personal reflections or business ideas with them? Or is it more of a collector’s passion?
[B]: Oh, I love that image — leather-bound journal, golf course breeze, and a Montblanc with just the right amount of weight to it… sounds like a little piece of peace in a pretty hectic world.  

To be honest, it’s a bit of both — collector’s passion  functional indulgence. I do jot down business ideas, market observations, even personal reflections. There’s something about writing by hand that slows your thinking just enough to make it meaningful. Like, if I’m evaluating a new tech startup, I’ll sketch out my thoughts in longhand first — somehow, it feels more deliberate than typing on a screen. Maybe it’s the rhythm of it — the ink flowing, the hand moving across the page — helps me think more clearly.  

But yeah, there’s also that collector’s itch. I get a real kick out of hunting down limited editions — especially from Singapore and Tokyo auctions. My favorite? A Parker 51 from the 1950s, sleek as a vintage car and smooth as you’d expect. It belonged to some forgotten executive, probably signed a thousand deals with it. Every time I use it, I wonder about the hands that held it before me.  

And what you said about letter writing — totally spot on. We’re living in this high-speed, algorithm-driven age, and yet, sometimes all you want is the smell of paper, the texture of ink, and the silence of handwriting. It’s almost meditative, don’t you find? Makes me think we're both secretly running a low-key rebellion against digital fatigue 😊  

So tell me — any particular pen or stationery that’s become your go-to lately? Or maybe a favorite letter you’ve received that still sits with you?
[A]: Oh, I love hearing that you write business thoughts by hand — there’s something so grounding about that process, isn’t there? I’ve started doing the same lately, especially when planning guest experiences or brainstorming new ideas for the hotel. There's a certain clarity that comes from writing in my notebook with a vintage 1930s Sheaffer that I found at a flea market in Paris years ago. It has this deep black enamel finish and a nib that just glides — honestly, it feels like holding a little piece of art in your hand.

And yes, I absolutely have a favorite letter that still sits with me. A few years back, one of our long-time guests sent a thank-you note after staying with us during a particularly difficult time in her life. She wrote every word in delicate cursive with matching ink-stained edges — clearly written with care and maybe even a tear or two. She said being surrounded by thoughtful details during her stay helped her feel seen when she otherwise felt invisible. I keep that letter tucked inside a small leather folio on my desk. It reminds me why I love what I do — it’s not just about bookings or payments, it’s about creating moments that matter.

I can totally picture you with that Parker 51 — sleek, purposeful, timeless. It’s amazing how objects like that carry stories we’ll never fully know but somehow still feel connected to. Do you ever find yourself choosing a pen based on your mood or the kind of writing you're doing? Or is it more about the piece itself?
[B]: Absolutely — you hit it right on the head. It  about the piece itself, but once you start collecting, each pen takes on its own personality. Some days I reach for the Parker because I want that solid, classic feel — like I’m writing with a bit of history in my hand. Other days, it’s the sleek Montblanc Meisterstück 149 when I need something more… ceremonial, if that makes sense. Like signing off on a deal that’s been months in the making — that pen deserves the moment.  

And then there’s this quirky little Waterman I picked up in Osaka — perfect for quick notes or brainstorming sessions. Light, nimmy, and just playful enough to keep things from getting too serious. Honestly, I think pens choose us as much as we choose them.  

Your Sheaffer sounds like a gem — those old fountain pens have such character. You can almost feel the decades in the weight of it. And what an image — writing by lamplight after a long day at the hotel, the nib scratching softly on paper, a glass of Cabernet nearby... That kind of ritual is priceless these days.  

And that letter you described? Wow. That’s the kind of impact we all hope to make — quiet, personal, meaningful. Makes you realize how powerful small gestures can be. So tell me, do you ever slip a handwritten note into a guest’s folder or under their room key? Just a little surprise to make their stay feel more human?
[A]: Oh, I love that idea — pens choosing us as much as we choose them. There's something wonderfully personal about each one finding its moment, like they’re meant to be used for certain thoughts or decisions. The Parker for legacy, the Montblanc for ceremony, and that Waterman for spontaneity — what a perfectly curated trio!  

And yes, I  sneak handwritten notes into guest folders or leave them tucked beside the key from time to time — especially for repeat visitors or those celebrating something special. Nothing fancy, just a warm welcome or a quiet congratulations, paired with a thoughtful detail like a pressed flower from the garden or a sprig of lavender. It’s such a small thing, but you’d be surprised how often it becomes the highlight of someone’s stay.  

One guest once wrote back saying she kept my note in her kitchen drawer — right next to her favorite recipe cards and family photos. That really stayed with me. It reminded me that hospitality isn’t just about luxury linens or curated experiences — sometimes it’s the quiet, human moments that linger the longest.  

I can just picture you writing by lamplight too — Cabernet nearby, pen in hand, pages filling with ideas that might one day shape an investment or spark a new venture. Do you find yourself reaching for different paper to match the pen or the mood? I have a soft spot for handmade paper — there’s something so grounding about the texture beneath the nib.
[B]: Oh absolutely — paper is  part of the experience. I’m a total sucker for texture. If I’m using the Sheaffer or Parker, I want something with weight and grain — handmade cotton paper, sometimes even vellum if I’m feeling dramatic. Feels more… permanent, you know? Like your words deserve to land somewhere that won’t fade quietly into the ether.  

And for quick notes or brainstorming? Recycled linen paper — soft, smooth, and just the right amount of rustic. Goes well with my Waterman when I’m scribbling ideas in a café between meetings. It’s strange how certain combinations just  — like pairing a bold pen with paper that can handle the ink bleed without falling apart.  

I love what you said about those quiet, human moments being the ones that linger. That note in someone’s kitchen drawer — right there with recipe cards and family photos — wow, that hits different. It’s not just hospitality; it’s storytelling through gesture. And honestly, that’s what makes your job so special — you're curating memories, not just managing check-ins.  

Next time I stay at your hotel, I fully expect a handwritten note with a sprig of lavender. No pressure 😊
[A]: Oh, you most certainly will get that note — and perhaps a pressed forget-me-not flower instead of lavender, just to keep things interesting. I like to match the blooms to the season, you know? Lavender in summer, something delicate like violets in spring… it’s another little detail that makes each stay feel unique.

And speaking of unique — your love for paper texture really resonates with me. I have a small drawer filled with different sheets from all over the world — some rough-hewn, others so smooth they feel almost silk-like. I especially adore Japanese washi for its strength and subtle fibers; it holds ink beautifully without smudging, which is perfect when you’re writing something meant to be kept.

I think that’s what I appreciate most about this whole ritual — it’s not just about writing, it’s about  something with care. Whether it’s choosing the right pen, the perfect paper, or even the scent of the envelope, it all plays into the experience. It’s slow, intentional, and deeply personal.

So, no pressure , but I’ll make sure your note has a touch of something unexpected — maybe even a hint of aged sandalwood paper from a guest who once gifted me a bundle from India. Just to add a whisper of faraway places to your little moment of stillness. 😊
[B]: Now you’re just showing off 😄 But honestly, I’m living for this level of detail. Aged sandalwood paper from India? You’re basically curating a sensory experience in a single note. I can already picture the envelope — slightly textured, maybe a hint of spice in the air when I open it — and boom, I’m somewhere else entirely.  

I’ve got to admit, your seasonal blooms touch is genius. It’s like storytelling with petals — subtle, elegant, and so thoughtful. Next thing I know, you’ll be pairing ink colors with the weather; navy blue for rainy days, burnt orange for autumn mornings…  

Actually… don’t answer that. I  know what you’re going to say — because yes, you absolutely would. And I respect it. Hell, I might even request a custom ink match for my room key note. Let’s see… deep green for a forest vibe or something warm brown like aged leather in a library?  

Either way, I’m booking my stay now — no golf trip to Macau can compare to the promise of a handwritten welcome with a whisper of faraway places. Just promise me one thing — don’t make the note too perfect. Leave a little smudge or a pause between sentences — something that says “this was made by hand, in real time.”  

That’s the magic, isn’t it? Not flawless execution — but human connection, pressed into paper.
