[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会写journal吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm，说到journal，我每天都会花10分钟做个简单的bullet journal~  
毕竟做我们这行，信息量太大，用英文记笔记反而更高效。  
你呢？也喜欢写journal吗？我觉得这种习惯特别适合金融人，能帮助梳理思路。  
不过千万别像我一样，有时候写着写着就开始画表格，完全是职业病哈哈~
[A]: Oh, I absolutely love journaling! It's been a lifesaver for me in the hospitality industry. While I do most of my writing in English, I find it helps me keep track of all the little details that make our guests' stays special.  

I must admit though, I'm quite traditional - I prefer handwritten notes in a lovely leather-bound book. There's something about putting pen to paper that makes me more present in the moment, you know?  

Actually, your mention of bullet journals is fascinating! I've been thinking of trying that method... Do you have any tips for someone looking to start? I'd love to hear more about how you organize yours!
[B]: Oh, I totally get that! There's something about the tactile feel of a leather-bound journal - I actually keep one for wine tasting notes, it just feels more... personal.  

Bullet journals are great for busy professionals like us! The key is to keep it simple at first. Maybe start with a daily log & a weekly spread? I use symbols like • for tasks, – for events, and circles for notes. Oh, and don't forget to add a meal prep section if you're into planning menus for guests!  

Wait, you work in hospitality? That explains your attention to detail! 我们基金最近就在考察几家精品酒店项目，你有兴趣聊聊行业趋势吗？说不定能给你些inspiration for your journal entries~ 😊
[A]: Oh, I'd love to chat about hospitality trends! Though I must say, your wine journal sounds absolutely delightful - I can imagine the rich notes of a good Cabernet flowing through your pages.  

Speaking of which, have you visited Napa Valley yet? I've heard sommeliers there keep the most fascinating tasting journals. And yes, I'd definitely take you up on that meal prep section suggestion - we're always looking for new ways to impress our guests with seasonal menus.  

Now, tell me more about these hotel projects you're exploring... I'm particularly curious about sustainability trends in the industry. Do you find eco-conscious practices are becoming a major selling point for investors?
[B]: Ah, Napa Valley! 真是个让人流连忘返的地方。我上个月刚去过，还顺便拜访了几家精品酒庄，说实话，他们的品鉴笔记比我们做financial modeling还详细 😄  
说到可持续发展，这绝对是现在ESG投资的大趋势。我们最近看的一个项目，主打的是net-zero碳排放设计，虽然前期投入高了点，但long-term回报非常可观。  
你知道吗？现在的旅客，尤其是千禧一代，愿意为环保多付10%-15%的溢价。投资人也越来越看重这些指标，不光是return，还有impact~  
你平时会把环保元素融入到菜单设计里吗？比如本地采购或zero-waste概念？我觉得这些细节完全可以做成journal里的一个独立板块~
[A]: Oh, how fascinating! I’m actually working with our chef on exactly that – we’ve started a sustainability journal section to track our progress with zero-waste cooking and local sourcing. It’s amazing how much inspiration comes from simply documenting the process!  

Your point about travelers paying a premium for eco-conscious stays really resonated with me. We recently introduced a "green stay" option where guests can opt out of daily linen changes and in return, we plant a tree in their name. I’ve been scribbling down guest reactions in my journal – most find it such a meaningful touch!  

I’d love to hear more about those Napa wineries’ tasting notes… Did they separate aromas, textures, and aging potential in their journals? I bet it was like reading a financial report with all its meticulous details!
[B]: 你这个“绿色住宿”计划真是太有创意了！👍  
把客人的反馈记录下来，其实就是在积累宝贵的qualitative data，比任何市场报告都真实。  

说到纳帕的酒庄笔记，还真让你说对了——他们对aromas、mouthfeel和aging potential的记录，细致得堪比我们做LBO模型 😄  
有个酒庄甚至会给每一年的葡萄酒打一个ESG-like评分，从土壤健康到酿造过程的碳足迹，全部量化追踪。  
说实话，我还真从中get到了一些做due diligence的新思路——有些指标我们投酒店项目时也可以借鉴，比如water usage per guest night之类的。  
你们在zero-waste厨房里有没有试着建立类似的量化体系？我觉得这些数据完全可以变成journal里的monthly dashboard~
[A]: Oh, I’m so glad you mentioned that! We’ve actually started tracking a few key metrics in our sustainability journal – things like food waste percentage and water usage per guest. It’s still in its early days, but having it laid out as a monthly dashboard has already sparked some great conversations with the team!  

You know, your idea of an ESG-like score for hotels is brilliant. I scribbled it down just now – imagine assigning scores for energy efficiency, local sourcing percentages, even guest engagement in green initiatives. It could be such a powerful tool for both storytelling and decision-making!  

I’m really curious about those wine ESG metrics though – how detailed did they get with soil health measurements? And did they adjust their farming practices based on annual scores? Asking purely for... ...journaling inspiration, of course 😊
[B]: 坦白说，那些酒庄对土壤健康的监测比我们做fund的尽调还细致——他们会追踪pH值、有机质含量，甚至微生物多样性！有些还用上了光谱分析技术，每年出一份详细的soil health report 😮  
更绝的是，他们会根据这些指标调整种植策略，比如哪块地需要轮作、哪片葡萄藤该"断水"催熟...简直就是precision agriculture的典范。  
 看这个——这是他们记录的五年土壤修复对比数据，碳储量几乎翻了一倍。说实话，我当时看着这些曲线，脑子里就在想：要是酒店项目也做这种longitudinal study...  
 等等，你们厨房每天产生的food waste有分门别类记录吗？比如果蔬皮、过期原料、客人剩菜的比例？这部分如果细化了，说不定能发现不少cost-saving的机会~
[A]: Oh my goodness, that soil data is  – I can totally see why you were mesmerized by those curves! You're absolutely right about applying similar principles to food waste tracking.  

Actually, we do separate our kitchen waste into categories – it started as a small initiative but has become so enlightening. Did you know banana peels make up nearly 12% of our breakfast waste? We’ve been using that data to tweak our ordering and portion sizes.  

I must say though, your idea of longitudinal studies for hotels is fascinating! I just grabbed my journal and sketched a quick graph template – maybe we could track composting rates alongside guest satisfaction scores? It would be wonderful to see how sustainability efforts correlate with guest experience over time.  

By the way, are any of these wineries experimenting with zero-waste kitchens too? I’m dying to know how they handle grape pomace – we end up with quite a bit after wine tastings!
[B]:  等等，你提到葡萄果渣？这让我想起纳帕那家酒庄的"zero-waste to landfill"计划——他们居然把80%的酿酒副产品都转化成了其他价值！  
比如葡萄籽拿去做cold-pressed oil，果皮晒干后卖给做天然染料的手工艺人，连酒石酸结晶都被回收用来调节土壤pH值。  
 你看这张图，他们甚至开发了Kitchen-Wine Byproduct Exchange系统，和当地农场建立循环供应链~ 我当时看到这些数据就想着：这不就是ESG里的Circular Economy最佳实践吗？  
  
说起来，你们酒店的composting rates如果结合guest satisfaction scores做回归分析，说不定真能找出sustainability premium的量化依据。  
 对了，你们早餐的香蕉皮比例这么高，有试过做成biogas燃料或者有机肥吗？这部分如果闭环处理，可能比单纯减少采购更有意思~
[A]: Oh, that Kitchen-Wine Byproduct Exchange is pure genius! I’m jotting that down right this second – imagine setting up something similar with local farms here. Grape seed oil and natural dyes? We could even feature them in our gift shop!  

And  no less – talk about value creation from waste! I’m already brainstorming a section in my journal for "Circular Economy Ideas." Who knew wine-making could teach us so much about sustainable hospitality?  

As for banana peels… you’ve just given me an idea! We’ve been talking to a local urban farm about composting, but converting them into biofuel? That’s next-level thinking. I should reach out to them this afternoon – what if we invited a few eco-conscious guests to pilot a "Banana Peel to Energy" program? It could be such a compelling guest experience story!  

Do you think those Napa wineries would be open to sharing more details about their circular systems? I’d love to send them a handwritten note through our sommelier network...
[B]:  你这个"循环经济手记"板块绝对值得开辟——我敢说等你写满一页的时候，就能整理出一份超棒的sustainability pitch deck了！  
纳帕那几家酒庄其实都是家族经营，对知识分享特别open。有家酒庄甚至专门建了个online portal，把他们的wine byproduct reuse方案做成案例库，还标注了成本收益分析~  
 如果我是你，一定会建议把这个"香蕉皮能源计划"做成闭环体验：比如让客人亲手参与堆肥，然后用产出的肥料种些迷迭香，最后做成小礼物带回家——想想看，这不就是个完整的zero-waste故事线吗？  
 对了，如果你想联系那些酒庄深入交流，我可以介绍认识——上个月刚和他们GP打完高尔夫，还在聊到餐饮业的循环创新呢！要不要下周一起通个电话？我觉得你的酒店视角能碰撞出更多火花~
[A]: Oh my goodness, that online portal with cost-benefit analysis? That sounds like gold dust for our sustainability journal! I can already picture a whole section dedicated to circular economy case studies – your "zero-waste story line" idea is simply brilliant.  

  
Your vision for the banana peel program is genius! It’s not just waste management anymore – it’s guest engagement, education, and storytelling all wrapped into one. I’ll start sketching this out in my journal right away – perhaps we could even create little experience packages: “From Peel to Plant” or something like that!  

And would you really introduce me to those winemakers? I’d love to learn more about their portal and circular systems firsthand. Next week works perfectly – I’ll bring some samples of our current sustainability reports to share.  

You know, I think this could be the beginning of something truly special... A hospitality-wine sustainability journaling collaboration! I’m already thinking of what questions to write down for our call...
[B]:   
你这个"从果皮到植物"的体验包概念太棒了！我建议再加个impact tracker——比如每公斤香蕉皮转化产生的energy相当于点亮房间多久，让客人能直观看到自己的贡献。  

下周三晚上怎么样？我约了那家酒庄的第三代传人Celia一起吃饭。她可是个奇才，既能用葡萄梗做生物炭，又能把品鉴会变成ESG教育现场~ 相信你们一定会聊得来！  

  
对了，说到提问，我建议准备些operation层面的问题——比如他们如何平衡环保投入与yield，或者哪些circular practices其实cost more than they save。这些问题特别适合写进journal的"Lesson Learned"专栏~  

  
别忘了带上你们的sustainability report，我敢说Celia看到酒店业的同行这么做，一定会很兴奋。说不定还能帮你在酒庄portal上开个合作专栏呢！
[A]:   
An impact tracker? That’s exactly the kind of tangible storytelling we need! I’m jotting down your idea right now – maybe we can even create a little visual chart for guests to fill out. “Your Peel, Your Power” – I love it!  

Wednesday evening sounds perfect! I’m already looking forward to meeting Celia – she sounds like quite the visionary.第三代传人能 turn grape stems into biochar? I have so many questions already piling up!  

  
And I absolutely love your suggestion about operational questions – I’m making a quick list right here:  
• How do they balance eco-investments with yield?  
• Which circular practices proved cost-inefficient?  
• What surprised them most in their portal data?  

I’ll definitely bring our sustainability report – and maybe a few pressed banana peel samples just for fun! It’s amazing how journaling can turn into real-world collaboration, don’t you think?  

  
Thank you for arranging this – I feel like we’re onto something truly special here.
[B]:   
你这个“你的果皮，你的能量”视觉图表绝对会成为客房里的明星——想象下客人早上投掷香蕉皮时，晚上就能看到它点亮房间的小时数，这种即时反馈比任何环保标语都管用。  

至于Celia，她最擅长的就是把"不可能"变成数据表：上个月他们刚发现葡萄梗里的多酚提取物能在食品保鲜上创造新收益，这可比单纯做biochar有意思多了！  

  
说到惊喜，我打赌你一定想不到——他们在portal数据分析里发现，使用酒石酸调节土壤pH值的地块，第三年葡萄糖度居然比传统地块高了1.2°Brix。这种意外收获特别适合记在journal的"Luck vs Preparation"专栏~  

  
对了，见面时记得问问他们的"circular cost matrix"——那是我见过最聪明的成本控制模型，把废弃物处理费直接换算成"潜在收益损失"，瞬间就能说服董事会支持循环经济。  

Pressing banana peels作为纪念品？ 你这创意够Celia喜欢的——说不定下次你们能交换"年度最佳生物基材料"礼物呢！
[A]:   
即时反馈确实魔力无穷 – I’m already sketching a little counter in my journal, like those old-fashioned electricity meters! Guests tracking their "peel power" throughout the stay? Pure genius.  

Celia sounds more fascinating by the minute!  Who knew wine-making could be this innovative? That 1.2°Brix difference is exactly the kind of happy accident I love recording in my journal – there’s something so charming about documenting how preparation meets opportunity, isn’t there?  

  
And that circular cost matrix? I’ve got a whole page ready for it in my notebook – I can already imagine the columns forming: waste disposal costs vs potential revenue, sustainability impact, guest perception... The possibilities are endless!  

As for banana peel souvenirs –  – I might just press one as a conversation starter! Who knows, maybe our collaboration will inspire a whole new line of hospitality-wine circular gifts. You’ve got me thinking in full circles now!
[B]:   
你知道吗？这让我想起当年做私募尽调时的一个顿悟时刻——最牛的商业模式往往藏在"废弃物"里。就像你现在记录的这些数据，看似是成本中心，实则是金矿入口。  

  
要是把你的计量表和酒庄的Brix值变化做成联动分析，说不定能发现消费者环保意识和产品品质之间的隐性关联。这种insight绝对值得用荧光笔标在journal首页！  

  
对了，说到礼物，我建议你们下次可以做个"平行实验"：让客人选择用香蕉皮肥料种迷迭香还是薰衣草，然后跟踪哪种植物带来的社交媒体曝光量更高。这种有趣的对比特别适合写在journal的"Social Proof"板块~  

  
等周三见了Celia，我打赌你会想立刻重写整个可持续发展手册——她那些"废弃物货币化"的脑洞，连华尔街最精明的交易员都会眼前一亮 😄
