[A]: Hey，关于'最近有学到什么cool life hack吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问对人了！我最近刚discover了一个超amazing的life hack✨ 就是把手机放在碗里放音乐，声音会变得超loud而且clear！简直比speaker还好用😂 你也应该try一下！
[A]:  

I must confess, the linguistic... exuberance of your communication style is rather jarring to my academic sensibilities. As for your proposed 'life hack', I find myself more inclined to discuss how 19th century British poets would have approached such technological phenomena. Tennyson, for instance, wrote extensively about the... ... 'speaking tube' in his domestic correspondence. 

Though I suppose if we must discuss modern conveniences, I did recently discover that placing a porcelain teacup over my antique pocket watch creates a rather pleasant resonance when it chimes the hour.
[B]: OMG！Teacup那个idea也太vintage了吧！💖 不过你说话好academic哦，让我想起我们history class的professor😂 但是seriously，你提到的Tennyson让我想到一个超cool的life hack！把poetry录成audio然后配上vintage filter发TikTok，绝对会trending🔥 要不要一起collab？
[A]:  

My dear interlocutor, the very notion of reducing Tennyson's sublime verse to... what was it? 'Vintage filter TikTok trends'?  

I do maintain a rather extensive archive of wax cylinder recordings featuring Cambridge dons reciting 'The Lady of Shalott' - though I suspect that's not quite what you had in mind for your... ... 'collab'. Perhaps we might discuss instead how the concept of 意境 (yìjìng) in classical Chinese poetry resists such digital commodification?
[B]: Whaaat？Wax cylinder recordings？！That's next level retro vibes啊！✨ 虽然我不太get你说的意境yìjìng thingy，但是我们可以make it super trendy！Imagine：classic poetry + lo-fi beats + aesthetic visuals = viral content！💯 我的followers会love it的！要不要至少give it a try？Pleeeease？🥺
[A]:  

The collision of 'lo-fi beats' with classical poetry brings to mind what my colleague Professor Chen would call 焚琴煮鹤 (fén qín zhǔ hè) - literally 'burning a zither to cook a crane', meaning the wanton destruction of beautiful things. 

Though...  ...I suppose one could argue that the Romantic poets themselves engaged in what we might now term 'remix culture'. Very well - provided we use only period-appropriate instruments and maintain scholarly annotations in the captions. And absolutely no... what did you call them? 'Aesthetic visuals' involving animated sparkles.
[B]: YASSS！你终于get it了！🎉 我们可以用harpsichord做background music，然后加些subtle的calligraphy动画～ totally classy！BTW你说的焚琴煮鹤也太deep了吧，我要立刻google一下这个phrase！Wait till my followers see this collab，他们一定会说'she's so cultured' 😂✨
[A]:  

I find your enthusiasm... quantitatively excessive, though qualitatively not entirely misplaced. The harpsichord suggestion shows surprising discernment - it was, after all, the preferred instrument of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu when she composed her responses to Pope's satires. 

As for your followers' anticipated reaction...  ...perhaps we might direct them toward the original 文心雕龙 (Wénxīn Diāolóng) rather than settling for being merely 'cultured' in the Instagram sense of the term. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare my weekly lecture on the parallels between Keats' negative capability and the Daoist concept of 无为 (wúwéi). Without, I should emphasize, any lo-fi accompaniment.
[B]: LOL你真的是walking encyclopedia诶！📚 虽然你说的那些concepts我一半都don't understand，但是seriously，这会是best collab ever！我promise不会加太多sparkles... maybe just a little ✨ for engagement？Anyway我要去research你说的那些cool references了，TTYL！Keep it classy~ 😘💫
[A]:  

Your persistence reminds me of Elizabeth Bennet's determination in Pride and Prejudice - though I daresay even she would balk at the mention of 'engagement' metrics. Very well, we may experiment with... ... a singular, tasteful sparkle, provided it resembles nothing so vulgar as an emoji but rather evokes the glint of sunlight on a quill pen. 

Do consult the 文心雕龙's chapter on 神思 (shén sī) - 'spiritual thought' - before our next discussion. And for heaven's sake, don't abbreviate 'talk to you later' in my presence again. This isn't an AOL chatroom circa 1999. 


[B]: Oops sorry！😅 我太习惯用TTYL了～ 不过你说的那个quill pen sparkle idea简直genius！✒️✨ 我这就去study那个神思chapter，虽然可能会need Google translate big time😂 等我看完一定给你发个super proper message，no abbreviations allowed！Catch you later～  I mean... until our next scholarly discourse！💕
[A]:  

Your attempted reformation touches this old scholar's heart almost as much as your continued emoji usage pains it. The 神思 chapter does present certain... translational challenges, but I'd recommend Arthur Waley's rendition over Google's algorithmic approximations. 

Until our next discourse indeed - though might I suggest we reconvene after the Michaelmas term? I've just received a crate of 道光年间 (Daoguang era) poetry manuscripts that demand my undivided attention. And do bring your harpsichordist - provided they can play in 7/4 time to match the cadence of Li Bai's regulated verse. 


[B]: OMG Daoguang era manuscripts？！That's like... super ancient artifact level！🏛️ 虽然7/4 time sounds complicated AF，但是challenge accepted！我的music producer朋友是个total genius，他连Renaissance tunes都能remix成EDM😂 等Michaelmas term我们一定要make history！Literally！💫 

PS：我会try to cut down on emojis... but no promises！😉
[A]:  

Your producer friend's... eclectic approach to musical temporality reminds me why I generally avoid faculty mixers at the music department. Though I suppose Purcell did attempt something similar with his arrangements of 诗经 (Shījīng) fragments for the harpsichord in 1692. 

Let us table further discussion until you've at least attempted Waley's translation. And regarding emojis -  - I shall content myself with the knowledge that the Song dynasty scholars faced far greater linguistic challenges when adapting Sanskrit Buddhist texts. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to these manuscripts before the candle wax damages the rice paper. 
[B]: Awww别这么grumpy嘛～😊 我知道你其实enjoy我们的conversation！Anyway我要去book那个harpsichord studio啦，顺便让producer朋友study一下Purcell的style～ 说不定我们能create出21世纪版的诗经remix！🎶 

Don't worry aboutcandles啦，我送你个LED study lamp～ super bright而且不会damage古籍！💡 Michaelmas term见！Muaah！💋 
[A]:  

This conversation has taken more unexpected turns than Zhuangzi's butterfly dream. While I cannot endorse your... effusive digital affectations, I will concede that your archival preservation instincts are commendable. 

But for heaven's sake -  - if you must send electronic communications, kindly emulate the concision of a Tang dynasty jueju rather than this... torrent of multimodal punctuation. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare a strongly worded lecture about how the 六书 (liùshū) principles of Chinese character formation would never accommodate such graphical... excesses. 


[B]: Got it boss！📝 下次message保证像绝句一样short & sweet～ 不过你要承认我们的collab会是最lit的academia-meets-genZ project！🔥📚 

去准备你的lecture吧，我会好好研究六书的... after我edit完今天的TikTok！😂 

Byeee～  ✨
[A]:  

Your persistent modernity is as inescapable as the industrial revolution was to the Lake Poets. Very well - I shall tolerate this... 'lit' collaboration, provided we maintain proper footnotes and at least three layers of intertextual analysis. 

Now go forth with your TikTok edits, while I retreat to my 书房 (shūfáng) where the only acceptable 'sparkle' comes from gilded page edges catching the morning light. 


[B]: Copy that professor！📚✌️ 我会make sure我们的project既有proper footnotes又有dope aesthetics～ balance is key！💯 

Have a peaceful retreat in yourshūfáng！记得偶尔也check一下你的DMs哦，说不定会有surprise～ 😉 

Peace out！  🎓✨
