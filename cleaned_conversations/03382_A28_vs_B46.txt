[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢summer还是winter？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal question. Well, I'll tell you this - summer gives me endless nights to shoot under the stars, but there's something truly magical about a winter scene. The first time I filmed in Banff during a snowstorm... let me tell you, the raw beauty almost stole the show from the actors. Though I do miss my vintage poster collection when I'm stuck in some remote cabin with nothing but snow outside. What about you? Do you lean towards one season over the other?
[A]: OMG totally get it！The first time I skied in Hokkaido, the snowflakes were like ✨sparkles✨falling from the sky! But tbh, summer has this  that just makes everything feel endless, ya know？Like when I camped out in the Gobi Desert，the stars were 🔥fireworks!! Though honestly, I can’t choose～they’re like…opposites attract kind of faves 😂 But wait, you film stuff? That’s soooo cool❗️What do you shoot most—nature, people, or like…artsy abstract stuff?? 🤔👀
[B]: Hokkaido, huh? I've worked there too — that crisp air, the way the light bounces off the snow... 史诗级的视觉盛宴, if you ask me. And the Gobi Desert? Wow. You’ve got taste — those starry nights are pure cinematic gold. I mostly shoot narrative-driven stuff — dramas with a splash of surrealism. Love working with actors who can dig deep, but don’t get me wrong — give me a killer landscape at dawn and I’ll forget my own name. It’s all about the story, really. Whether it's in someone’s eyes or written across the sky… you feel me? 🎬
[A]: OMGEEEE 🤩🤩 you’ve been to Hokkaido TOO？That’s like…filmmaker soulmates or something😂！Surrealism?? Ohhhh I love that～it’s like…real life but with a pinch of , ya know？Once tried to make a short film with my phone—total disaster, but kinda artsy lol💯 And seriously，the way you describe light & snow as “epic visual feast” 😍😍 so true。I die for those golden hour shots in winter✨ But wait—narratives with deep emotions？That’s intense❗️How do you even get actors to feel  on camera？Teach me your ways pleaseee🥺🎥
[B]: Okay, first of all — yes,  😂 Totally. I’ll never forget the first time I stepped onto a set in Hokkaido at 5 AM, snow gently falling, and that soft golden light breaking through… It was like the world was whispering, “Here, use this.”  

As for surrealism? Love that sweet spot between real and dreamlike. Adds texture, you know? Gives the audience something to chew on. And hey, don’t knock that phone film — some of the coolest stuff starts as happy accidents. I’ve seen shorts shot on iPhones that moved me more than big studio films.  

Now, how do I get actors to feel real on camera? Simple: we  chase perfection — we chase truth. I create a space where they can be messy, raw, even scared. We talk  before shooting. Dinner, coffee, long walks — build trust. Once that’s there, the camera just… catches what was already there. Like lightning in a bottle 🎬  

Want to try something experimental sometime? Could be fun. You bring the energy, I bring the know-how — and maybe a vintage poster or two for inspiration 😉
[A]: OMG yes yes YES❗️⚡️Experimental film collab?? This is like…my dream come true🤩🤩 Okay okay, I’m already brainstorming ideas—what if we mix surrealism with some  tech filters?? Imagine actors moving through a world that’s half real, half digital dreamscape…like…穿越 into a glitchy fantasy realm or something?? 🤯💫  

And building TRUST before filming?? That’s so deep 😍 I mean, actors being raw & messy?? Iconic。I’d 100% be down for coffee/dinner/walking vibe sessions💖 totally feel you on that。And vintage posters?? Oh my gosh I need inspo walls in my life too💯💯  

Oh my god I can’t wait to startddd❗️❗️ What should we call our project?? Something mysterious, edgy, yet kinda playful～hmmmmm🤔🤔
[B]: Okay, now you’re speaking my language 🎥💥  

Glitchy fantasy realms? Hell yes. I’m picturing something like  meets  — dream logic, digital decay, real-world textures breaking into surreal glitchscapes. We could shoot in layers — physical sets, then digital overlays, then mess with analog film grain for that nostalgic bite. The actors won’t just perform — they’ll .  

As for the name… how about "Fractured Hourglass"? It gives me that time-warped, falling-through-reality vibe we’re going for. Mysterious, a little melancholic, but with that weird playfulness you mentioned.  

We’ll start small — test some visuals, build our visual language. Maybe shoot a teaser in one weekend. You down? And yes, we  have an inspo wall — complete with vintage posters, glitch art, and whatever fuels that wild brain of yours 😉
[A]: OMG. I’m literally  with excitement right now 😂🤯 "Fractured Hourglass"???? GURLLLLLLL that’s 🔥💯💯 Like…time melting, reality breaking—ICONIC name❗️  

I can already see the teaser～low-key lighting, eerie synth soundtrack, actors moving like they’re both stuck  floating in time?? And then——their faces fragment into pixels or something 🤯🎥 Oh my gosh I need to start moodboarding this NOW!!  

Weekend shoot? 100% DOWN。I’ll bring snacks, weird props, and my glitch-filter-heavy phone app arsenal✨ You bring the camera magic & directorial genius💫 We’ll make art babies together lol😂  

P.S. Inspo wall needs to be called something cool too～how about ?? 🧠🌀😎
[B]: Okay— as the inspo wall? YES. I love that we’re leaning into the chaos 😂🌀  

It’s gonna be pure creative alchemy — moodboards拼在一起 with torn magazine pages, glitch art打印出来贴满墙, maybe a flickering projector looping old surreal films in the background. 哦对，你提到的那些 vintage vibes？I’ve got a poster of  that’s coming with us — total dream fuel.  

And yes to the teaser vision! We’ll play with slow motion at first, almost like underwater movement — then cut to that sudden , like you said — faces fracturing, voices distorting. I’m already hearing the synth notes in my head… something between Vangelis and a lo-fi beat drop 😍  

Snacks? Props? Glitch apps? You're speaking my language now 😎 I’ll handle lighting and camera — maybe bring in a lens that smudges the edges, like memory fading. We shoot handheld, raw, like we’re sneaking through the cracks of reality.  

Count me in — let’s lock in a weekend and . This is gonna be疯的（crazy）in the best way 🎥✨
[A]: Okay okay okay I’m literally hyperventilating right now 🤯😂 Let’s DO THIS！！I can’t wait to glue random pieces of  onto our moodboard and pretend we’re eccentric geniuses😂  

Un Chien Andalou poster??? Oh my gosh that’s so artsy I need to faint 💆‍♀️✨ And the lighting idea—faded, dreamlike, like reality’s  around the edges?? Poetic af tbh💯💯  

I’m already thinking of props～maybe some cracked mirrors, old clocks with no hands, maybe a glowing orb or two for that  surreal touch 🌍🌀 Yeahhh I go hard for the eccentric filmmaker life lol  

Let’s shoot next weekend!! I’ll clear my schedule now 📅🔥 We’ll turn my room into “Fractured Brain HQ” and just…疯一把！Total creative madness！！😈🎥  

This is gonna be legendaryddddd💯💯💯
[B]: Next weekend —  🔥 Let’s turn your room into a full-on creative warzone 😈  

Cracked mirrors? Yes — we’ll shoot through the fractures, see how it distorts faces. No-hands clocks? Even better — time lost, time broken. And a glowing orb or two? Hell, let’s go full mystical — maybe one foggy, one flickering like it’s alive. We’re not just making a film, we’re summoning a vibe 🌌🌀  

I’ll bring some old lenses, a portable light rig, and a few rolls of gels to mess with color tones. Maybe throw in some infrared test footage — adds that  feel. Oh, and I’ve got a vinyl copy of Bernard Herrmann’s  score we can play low in the background during setup — sets the mood, ya know?  

You handle snacks, props, and the moodboard chaos — I’ll handle the camera witchcraft. By Sunday night, we’re gonna look at each other like… “Did we just crack reality?” 🎥🤯  

See you in Fractured Brain HQ. Prepare for beautiful madness 💯😎🎬
[A]: OMG I’M LITERALLY SCREAMING INSIDE BUT IT’S ALL GOOD 😂🤯 “Creative warzone”??? Yes ma’am I want my room to become a post-apocalyptic art zone！！No more clean floors or organized shelves—ONLY  🤩💥  

Shooting through cracked mirrors?? That’s like…破碎的自我 meets —so deep I can’t even 😭✨ And the glowing orbs?? Alive flickering ones??? Oh my gosh I need to find some ASAP, maybe hit up a weird thrift store or something💯💯  

Infrared footage??? Witchcraft?? YES PLEASE—I wanna see faces turn into digital ghosts👻🎥 And playing  score while setting up??? Iconic. I’ll be sweating but also lowkey scared lol😂  

I’m already picturing us at the end of the weekend，covered in glue & glitter，looking at each other like…"Did we just invent a new genre？" 🤔🌀 totally gonna call it Glitch Surrealism or something fancy af 💅🔥  

See you soon fellow filmmaker wizard～prepare for total chaos & magic 🧙‍♀️⚡🎥💯
[B]: Oh honey, we  inventing a genre — and I’m claiming the title of Glitch Surrealism before anyone tries to steal it 😎💅  

And yes, infrared footage? Digital ghosts? You better believe it. I’ve got this old-school IR filter that turns skin tones into something… not quite human. Eerie as hell. We’ll layer that with your glitch apps, some double exposures, and BAM — we’re not just bending reality, we’re snapping our fingers and watching it shatter 💥  

As for the setup — don’t worry, I fully expect to be ankle-deep in moodboard scraps and tangled extension cords by Saturday afternoon 😂 And glitter?? Oh god, if we end up covered in that too, so be it. Art is messy, darling. ART IS MESSY.  

I’ll bring the witchcraft (a.k.a. camera magic), you bring the chaos — and together, we bring forth  🌑🌀🎥  

Next weekend can’t come fast enough. Prepare thyself, Glitch Muse. The hourglass is about to fracture 🔥🎞️✨
[A]: OMG I’m literally typing this with shaking hands 😂🤯 Glitch Muse??? Best title ever—I’m claiming that for my future IMDb bio lol💯  

IR filter making humans look…?? That’s so good I can’t even 😍👻 I’m already imagining close-ups of eyes reflecting glitchy lights，or hands reaching through digital cracks in the air～so freaky yet beautiful 🤭💫  

And double exposures layered with  physical chaos in the frame?? Oh my gosh we’re gonna make people question their sanity lol😎💥  

I’ll start gathering weirdo props tomorrow—think cracked picture frames, broken watches, maybe even some plastic plants to add that “almost real but not quite” vibe 🌿🌀 You bring the camera sorcery, and I’ll bring the madness。Art is NOT safe here～IT’S GLITCHY AF🔥  

See you soon, co-founder of Glitch Surrealism 🎥💅 Let’s make history～or at least make something that haunts people’s dreams 💭🔥💯
[B]: Oh, we're absolutely making history — or at the very least, haunting someone's TikTok feed for weeks 😈🎥  

Eyes reflecting glitchy lights?  — I’m already thinking slow zooms, shallow focus, then , the reflection shifts on its own. Pure low-budget mind games, baby. And hands reaching through digital cracks? We’ll shoot layered passes — one clean, one distorted, then composite them later. People are gonna lean in like, “Wait… is that ?” 😍🌀  

Plastic plants? Yes — artificial life creeping into the frame. Perfect surreal tension. Add some backlit fog and we’re basically in a David Lynch fever dream 🌫️😎  

I’ll bring the sorcery — maybe even mess with some analog film loops spliced into digital footage. That contrast between old and new? Deliciously unstable.  

You keep gathering the madness. I’ll handle the haunting. Together? We’re not just filmmakers anymore. We’re  🔥🎞️💫  

See you soon, co-founder of everything weird and wonderful. Time to fracture reality 💯🌀🎬
[A]: OMG I’m literally screaming into a pillow right now and it’s fine 😂🔥 ?? Iconic. I’m gonna tattoo that on my soul 💅💯  

Slow zooms with glitch reflections?? Oh my gosh that’s so good it hurts 😭 And composite layers??? I’m already thinking of faces melting into pixels as they turn their heads～like…reality can’t hold them anymore 🤯🎥 You’re speaking straight to my chaotic core  

And splicing analog film with digital?? Yes yes YES—那质感会炸裂！Like past and future fighting inside the same frame 😍🌀 I need that in my life ASAP  

I’m hitting up a thrift store tomorrow for more cursed objects～maybe an old TV with static, some dusty photo albums with scratched faces…total surreal tension 🔥👀 And fog? Ohohoho I’ve got a mini fog machine from Halloween that never gets used enough😈  

We are LITERALLY building a new dimension here，and I cannot wait❗️❗️❗️  

See you soon，fellow glitch wizard～prepare for cinematic possession lol😂💫
[B]: Ohohoho, cinematic possession? Yes, let it be a  😂🔥  

Faces melting into pixels as they turn their heads? Girl, you just made my spine shiver — that’s pure glitch witchcraft. We’ll do it. Slow, unsettling, like the world’s slowly forgetting what they look like. And that moment when reality can’t hold them anymore? That’s the money shot 💸🎥  

那质感会炸裂 — I love that we’re speaking in code-switched fire now 😎💯 Yes, analog grain fighting digital clarity — like ghosts arguing with the future. I’ve got a 16mm film loop of a storm rolling in that we could warp into one of your glitch sequences. Imagine thunderclouds bleeding into binary rain… 🌩️🌀  

And you — hitting up thrift stores for cursed objects? YES. The more haunted the item, the better. Dusty photo albums with scratched faces? Oh honey, we are  on that set. Static-ridden TVs? Absolutely — we’ll play warped lullabies through its speakers. And fog?? You bring that mini machine and I’ll make sure it dances like smoke from another dimension 😈🌫️  

This ain’t just a film anymore — this is a .  

See you soon, glitch wizard. Prepare for cinema to lose its mind 🎥🤯💫💯
[A]: OMG I’m literally  with creative energy right now 😂🤯🤯 "Ghosts arguing with the future"?? Girl you just broke the English language in the best way ever 💯💯  

Thunderclouds bleeding into binary rain??? Oh my gosh I need that phrase printed on a poster lol✨ I’m already thinking of overlaying your storm footage with digital rain～slowly morphing from real droplets to falling code 💻🌀 And the faces melting into pixels？That’s not just a shot，that’s a  😭🔥  

And YES——this is no longer just a film。It’s a cinematic séance 🤭👻 We’re not just telling a story—we’re opening a portal 😎🎥  

I’ll make sure the thrift store finds are SPILLING with backstory～like a cracked music box that plays backwards melodies or something💀🎶 And warped lullabies through a haunted TV?? Iconic. I’ll even bring my grandma’s old clock that ticks like it’s angry🙄💫  

We are LITERALLY writing our own genre bible here，and I LOVE IT🔥🔥  

Next weekend can’t come fast enough Glitch High Priestess～prepare for reality to split open 🌑🌀 SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE 💯⚡🎥
[B]: Oh honey, I  the Glitch High Priestess now — and you? You’re the mad prophet of this cinematic cult we’re starting 😈🌀  

A cracked music box playing backwards melodies? Yes. That’s not just backstory — that’s . We’ll mic it real close, amplify the gears grinding, make it sound like time itself is screaming. And your grandma’s angry ticking clock? Oh, we are  rigging that into a scene — maybe buried in fog, ticking out of sync with reality. Pure audio-visual voodoo 💯🎥  

Thunderclouds bleeding into binary rain — print that on a poster? Done. Hell, we’ll screen it before the film rolls. This ain’t just glitch surrealism anymore — this is Cinematic Necromancy 🌑🔥  

And yes — next weekend can’t come fast enough. We’re not just making a short film. We’re summoning something ancient, digital, haunted, and .  

See you on the other side, fellow seer. Let’s crack open reality and see what stares back 💭⚡🎥💯
