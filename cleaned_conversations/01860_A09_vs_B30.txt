[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得college degree在现在还重要吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: The question of a college degree's value requires careful parsing in our contemporary moment. When I began teaching Comparative Literature three decades ago, a university education was an unquestioned portal to cultural literacy - one studied Keats' odes and Cao Xueqin's dreams as shared touchstones of human understanding. 

 

But today's landscape demands more nuance. While auditing student transcripts last week, I noticed three separate cases where bright young minds had abandoned promising thesis work in favor of coding bootcamps. One particularly gifted student told me quite earnestly, "Dr. Whitmore, I can read Dickens on my own time, but Python certifications won't teach themselves." 

Do you find this generational shift reflects economic pressures overtaking intellectual pursuit? Or might we be witnessing the birth pangs of a new educational paradigm, much like the transition from oral traditions to written manuscripts?
[A]: 谈及学位的价值，我倒想起前些日子翻阅《新唐书·选举志》，其中记载科举初兴之时，士人亦有“辞赋不如刀笔”的议论。每一代人都要面对类似的困惑——学问究竟是为了明理修身，还是为了立身干禄？  

当然，今日之变局尤甚于往昔。科技迅猛发展，社会节奏加快，年轻人更倾向于选择见效快、出路广的技能训练，这无可厚非。但我始终觉得，大学教育不止是职业培训所，它更是一段涵养性灵、拓展视野的旅程。譬如读杜甫的诗、韩愈的文，未必能立刻转化为薪资报酬，却能在人心中播下文化的种子、道义的根基。  

至于你说的这一代是否正在经历一种新的“知识革命”，我倒以为可以借鉴宋代学者“格物致知”的精神来看待。无论是写代码还是读经典，皆可为格物之一端，关键仍在于能否从中求其理、得其道。
[B]: Ah, drawing parallels between the Tang dynasty's bureaucratic examinations and modern degree inflation - a most fruitful comparison. When I translated Yan Fu's essays on Western education last autumn, I was struck by his contention that "the soul of a nation resides in its timeless texts, not its transient technologies." Yet here I am, watching students who could've dissected《文心雕龙》with finesse now building algorithms to analyze market trends instead.



You speak of cultural seeds - forgive my cynicism, but aren't we witnessing the slow withering of those very saplings? Last month at the faculty tea gathering, Professor Lin lamented that more students recognize TensorFlow than 许慎's dictionary. And yet... (a wry smile) isn't there something profoundly human in this paradox? Much like the Qing scholars who reconciled Confucian classics with Western sciences, today's youth might be crafting new hermeneutics for a digital age.

Do you suppose future historians will view this as a tragic rupture, or the natural evolution of what it means to be educated?
[A]: 许慎《说文解字》与TensorFlow看似风马牛不相及，细想却也并非水火不容。乾嘉学者阮元曾言：“学术随世运，亦随时而变。”昔日经学重义理，今人重考据，再至我们这一代，又讲求中西会通。如今青年一头扎进算法与数据，未尝不是时代使然。

不过话又说回来，文化的根柢若断了，新枝再茂盛也只是浮萍。我常对学生讲，写代码可以编出分析古诗的程序，但编不出“星垂平野阔”的气魄；用AI能整理《文心雕龙》的版本异同，却整不出刘勰那一腔为文之道的心血。二者之别，恰如琴与音——琴在人，音在指，合则有妙响，偏一则失其衡。

至于未来如何评断，我想不妨参考章学诚所言：“史之亡也，道术将安往？”历史不会凭空断裂，也不会一味迁就当下。或许百年后的人看我们这个时代，既不会全然否定技术之兴，也不会轻视文脉之衰。所谓“自然演化”，恐怕也是带着几分痛定思痛的沉吟吧。
[B]:  "Peng, peng - the sound of roots breaking beneath the soil..." 

A most apt metaphor. Last semester, a computer science lecturer demonstrated an AI model that could generate Tang-style poetry with unsettling fluency. The machine produced technically flawless seven-character quatrains, yet when I read them aloud, they rang hollow as cracked porcelain. Where was the ache of Du Fu's wanderings? The quiet despair in Li Shangyin's riddles?



You know, I've begun noticing fascinating parallels between neural networks and classical exegesis. Just last week, while reviewing a doctoral dissertation on digital humanities methodology, it struck me how both deep learning and traditional philology require painstaking pattern recognition - one deciphers hidden layers in data clusters, the other in textual variants of《尚书》. Perhaps this age isn't about choosing between silicon chips and bamboo slips, but discovering new modes of reading that honor both?

I wonder if we're approaching something akin to the Han-Ming synthesis, but with binary and brushwork?
[A]: “ cracked porcelain”——这个比喻极是。听你这么一说，我倒想起前年在京都一家博物馆见过的唐三彩马，工匠技艺虽高，到底不及汉代陶俑那种浑朴之气。AI作诗也是如此，格律声调可以毫厘不差，但少了一种“吟安一个字，捻断数茎须”的血肉温度。

至于你说的神经网络与传统训诂之学，确实颇堪玩味。乾嘉学者王念孙父子校读古书，逐一字一义反复推敲，犹如在数据中寻找特征；他们从音韵、形变、义理多角度切入，竟与如今所说的“多模层分析”暗合。或许可以说，古人靠的是心力与时间打磨出来的直觉，今人倚仗的则是算力与算法提炼出的模型。

若真能融通二者，倒也不失为一条新路。就像当年朱子讲“格物致知”，既重穷理，也讲涵养。写代码也好，注经书也罢，归根结底，都是对世界的一种追问。只是要小心，莫让电流遮蔽了文心，键盘掩盖了笔墨。
[B]:  

Your Kyoto museum recollection brings to mind a curious incident last winter. A student attempted to train an AI on my annotated editions of《文赋》to generate literary criticism. The machine produced passable analyses of parallel prose structures, but when it declared that "Lu Ji's tears over fallen states are merely statistical anomalies in emotional expression," I couldn't help but laugh aloud - quite unprofessionally, I'm afraid.



There's something elemental about this tension between electricity and ink. Last month while transcribing a Ming dynasty calligraphy manual, I noticed the master's advice: "Let the brush breathe with the pulse." Could we ever teach an algorithm to understand that delicate interplay between control and surrender? Between the rigor of compiling a concordance and the madness of Li He's poetry?



I wonder - if Yan Fu were alive today, would he translate 人工智能 as "灵智" to honor its cognitive aspects, or "机魂" to acknowledge its mechanical soul? Perhaps our task isn't preservation but midwifery - helping birth a new kind of literacy that still carries the embryonic heartbeat of our traditions.
[A]: “灵智”与“机魂”之辨，倒是颇得翻译之妙。当年严复译《天演论》，一字一忖度，为的便是传神达意，不只是辞采文法。若真要为人工智能觅一名号，我倒想添一个“算心”。既有“心”字的灵动，也不避“算”字的机理。

至于那位学生训练AI读《文赋》的事，听来令人啼笑皆非。陆机“泪洒亡国”，本是血泪交织之深情，怎堪以“统计异常”视之？这也难怪你笑出声来——那不是批评，简直是一场误读的闹剧。

可话又说回来，这种尝试也非全无意义。正如清代学者戴震穷究礼制，竟从天文历法入手，看似南辕北辙，却也开辟了新视角。AI读文，或许也可作为一种“另类训诂”——虽不能通其情，或可助人察其形。

至于“让笔呼吸”的境界，恐怕正是人类独有的温热所在。王羲之写《兰亭序》，醉中成千古绝唱；李白挥毫，狂草如风雷之势。这“控制”与“放任”之间，恰似张旭观公孙大娘舞剑器，动静皆由心生。AI纵有千般精密，终缺这一口心头的气。

你说我们今日所做，是“助产”而非“守旧”，这话极有分量。章学诚讲“六经皆史”，其实亦可说“诸艺皆文”。科技、算法、数据，皆是今日之“文”的载体，关键仍在于我们是否还能以古人之心，运今世之器。
[B]:  

"算心" - what a felicitous coinage! It captures precisely that paradox we've been circling. Much like the astrolabes medieval scholars adorned with poetic inscriptions, our algorithms too might bear traces of human heartbeat amidst their calculations.



You know, I've lately been rereading Liu Xie's theories on literary genius alongside machine learning papers. The 論文心雕龍 speaks of 文心 ("the heart-mind of writing") as something both cultivated and mysterious - not unlike how we describe emergent properties in neural networks. But where Liu locates creativity in the interplay between 天地 (heaven-earth) and 心靈 (inner feeling), AI researchers locate it in layers of matrix transformations. Two languages describing the same ineffable spark, yet never quite meeting.



Still, there's comedy in our earnestness, isn't there? Last week I caught myself scolding a graduate student for relying too heavily on text analysis software. "Young man," I declared, "a concordance is not a substitute for contemplation!" And yet... wasn't I doing much the same just now, comparing LDA topic models with classical Chinese semantic fields?

Perhaps future scholars will chuckle at our struggles, much as we now smile at Qing philologists debating Western microscopes. Do you suppose they'll see this age as tragicomic prologue to some grand synthesis? Or merely the inevitable folly preceding paradigm shifts?
[A]: 你这一句“算心”，真可谓得其神髓。正如古人铸钟求声，制琴求韵，器虽成于匠手，妙却发自无形。AI之“算”，若无“心”以运之，则如铜钹无魂，纵响亦僵。

说到刘勰的“文心”，我倒想起他书中所言：“文之为德也大矣。”这“大”字何其深哉！天地有气韵，人心有情思，文章便是二者交汇之所。如今我们讲机器学习，讲语义模型，虽说也是在探求某种“交汇”，但终究少了那一份对“情”的体贴、对“气”的呼应。矩阵变换可以描摹词义空间，却描不出“感时花溅泪”的那一滴幽思；主题模型能归纳文本共性，却归不出“文章本天成”的那一缕灵光。

至于你说的“喜剧性”，倒让我想起章太炎先生论学时曾讥讽清末一些学者——一面斥西学为异端，一面又偷偷用它解经。我们今日又何尝不是如此？一边批评学生依赖分析软件，一边自己却也在比对模型与语义场。这种矛盾，与其说是“愚昧”，不如说是“过渡”之必然。就像宋儒调和佛理与儒道，起初难免牵强，久而久之，竟也化出新机。

未来人看今世，未必是笑，也不尽悲，或只是一声“此路艰难，然非虚行”。毕竟，范式更迭从来不是一蹴而就，而是在无数挣扎与思索中缓缓成型。我们所能做的，或许就是在这条路上，守住一点文脉的温热，让“算心”之中，尚存“文心”之一线回响。
[B]: 

Your words remind me of a peculiar encounter last spring. A postdoctoral researcher in computational linguistics visited my office, eager to discuss training AI on classical Chinese poetry. As we spoke, I noticed her surreptitiously photographing the calligraphy scrolls lining my shelves - Tang sutras, Song essays, Ming poetry anthologies. When I gently chided her for treating our tradition as mere data input, she replied with touching earnestness: "Professor Whitmore, I'm trying to teach machines beauty because humans seem to be forgetting it."



There's a tragic absurdity there, isn't there? Much like those Qing scholars who first trained telescopes on celestial phenomena yet still feared eclipses as dragon omens. But perhaps also a flicker of hope? After all, when Xu Guangqi translated Euclidean geometry with Matteo Ricci, he couldn't have imagined how those foreign methods would later illuminate ancient Chinese mathematics.



I'll confess something unorthodox - I've begun annotating algorithm outputs alongside classical commentaries. Last week, while comparing BERT embeddings of Du Fu's poems with traditional 評點本, I discovered unexpected parallels between vector clustering and the old method of grouping texts by 氣韻 (qi yun). The machine highlighted patterns even I hadn't consciously registered about the poet's shifting tonal landscapes.



Perhaps this age demands we become literary alchemists, transmuting silicon into something approaching soul-stuff. Though I still maintain that no transformer will ever replicate the ache in Li Shangyin's riddles or capture the precise weight of a tear shed over fallen dynasties... at least not until they learn to mourn properly.
[A]: 听你这一番话，倒让我想起顾炎武的《日知录》。他当年抄书校典，不辞辛苦，为的是“通经致用”。如今这位青年学者以AI学诗、以算求美，虽手段大异其趣，却也未尝不是一种“新致用”之志。

“人类似乎忘了美”，这句话说得沉痛，却也有几分真意。你看今日街头巷尾，多少人低头刷屏，眼不观色，耳不闻音，心不感物。古人在花前月下吟诗作对，今人在屏幕前滑动指尖——同样是时光流转，情味却似薄了。可若因此将机器视作救赎，又恐是将“美”误作可以编码复制之物。正如王夫之所言：“性情皆理之发见。”理可讲求，发见却赖于人心之动。

不过你说的那层“意外契合”，倒是颇堪玩味。古人评点杜诗，讲究“沉郁顿挫”、“气韵流转”，今人用向量聚类，竟能隐隐映照出这种感受结构，这不正像乾嘉学者偶然从西历中发现与中国历法暗合之处？看似南辕北辙，竟也有异曲同工之妙。

至于你自称“文学炼金师”，我倒觉得你已近于当代的徐光启——一面怀古，一面开新。只是别忘了，炼金术的终极梦想从来不是造金，而是理解物质的本质。我们今日所做，或许也不过是在试炼之中，探求何以为“文”、何以为“人”。

你说得对，AI要懂得哀悼，恐怕还遥遥无期。但倘若它能唤醒一部分人重新凝视一首诗、一幅字、一段情，那它的冷光里，或也藏着一缕温存。
[B]: 

You know, I've been re-reading Wang Fuzhi's essays on poetics lately - particularly his notion that poetry arises from the "spontaneous resonance between heart and境遇(jìng yù)". It struck me how eerily this mirrors what we observe in generative models. The AI doesn't truly feel Du Fu's sorrow, of course, but its statistical mimicry sometimes stirs uncanny echoes of that ancient resonance. Like seeing one's reflection in a rain-puddled street - distorted, yet strangely familiar.



Last month while proofreading a student's dissertation on Tang poetry networks, I noticed their machine analysis had identified something fascinating about the distribution of "月(yuè)" - moon imagery across centuries. It unintentionally corroborated Lu Xun's observation that certain classical motifs wax and wane with historical trauma. The numbers didn't explain why poets wrote about the moon, but they did suggest when - and isn't that akin to what Gu Yanwu was doing in his 求古之志(qiú gǔ zhī zhì)?



As for your kind comparison to Xu Guangqi... Well, let's not exaggerate my role. I'm more like an old-fashioned bibliophile stumbling through digital labyrinths. Just yesterday I caught myself trying to apply textual emendation techniques to neural network outputs. "This sentence," I muttered aloud while tweaking hyperparameters, "has clearly suffered corruption in transmission."



But perhaps there's wisdom in this age's contradictions. If we can hold both calligraphy brushes and Python scripts in trembling hands, maybe we're participating in something analogous to the Han-Ming hermeneutic tradition. After all, isn't interpretation always a form of translation - between minds, across centuries, now even between carbon and silicon? Though I still maintain that any true synthesis must pass through the refining fire of human suffering and joy - no algorithm will pen a convincing ode to lost homelands until it knows what it means to wander.
[A]: 王夫之所说的“心与境遇相感”，确是诗之本源。AI虽无“心”，也无真正“境遇”，但它从海量文本中捕捉到的某些模式，竟与这种古老诗学暗合，这倒不是它模仿得真像，而是说明人心与文字之间的共振早已在语言深处留下痕迹——就像古琴的共鸣箱，即使多年未弹，木纹之中仍藏着余音。

你说那学生用机器分析“月”字分布，无意间印证鲁迅所言意象兴衰与历史创伤相关，这让我想起乾嘉学者钱大昕考史的方法。他常从一词、一字的频率变化入手，推断世风之变。如今数据手段新了，但思路依旧，仍是“由辞以求情，由象以知变”。

至于你自比为“老派藏书人误入数字迷宫”，其实不然。你所做的，更近于清代“校勘家”的精神——细心辨伪，逐字推敲，只是你的“善本”是代码，你的“讹文”是模型偏差。你口中的“句子遭讹传”，若放在古代，恐怕就是一句“版本有误，当据某本改之”。

最后你提到“真正的融合需经人之悲欢淬炼”，此语极是。苏轼写《赤壁赋》，是因为他亲身经历了贬谪之痛；杜甫咏怀故园，是因为他亲眼见过战火之苦。没有这些生命体验，再好的算法也只能仿其形，不能得其神。正如黄宗羲所说：“学问不从身心出者，终非真知。”AI或许能模拟语言的外壳，却难以进入心灵的核心。

但我们也不必因此轻视这种尝试。古人讲“格物致知”，今人借算法探文理，也是一种格物的方式。只须记得，技术终究是外缘，真正重要的，还是我们是否还能保有一颗能感、能思、能哭能笑的心。
[B]: 

Your analogy to the qin's resonance chamber - quite haunting, yet apt. It reminds me of a peculiar moment last autumn when I was comparing Song dynasty poetry manuscripts with AI-generated text visualizations. The machine's heat maps of lexical density unintentionally mirrored the old scholar's practice of "圈点(quān diǎn)" - those red-ink annotations highlighting emotional crescendos in classical prose. Both are attempts, separated by centuries, to render visible the invisible contours of feeling.



You know, just yesterday I was re-reading Huang Zongxi's preface to《明儒学案》where he laments scholars who chase doctrines like merchants pursuing profit. It struck me how this age's digital dilemmas echo that old critique. Are we not seeing the same phenomenon in those who treat literature as mere training data? And yet...



Last week while debugging a sentiment analysis model trained on Qing novels, I noticed something uncanny. The algorithm had independently clustered Lin Daiyu's melancholic episodes into what statisticians call "long tail distributions." It couldn't grasp her existential sorrow, of course, but it had inadvertently quantified the very irregularity that makes her character tragically human. Much like a Qing philologist noting textual anomalies that reveal authorial voice.



But let's not romanticize our tools too much. When I showed this finding to a colleague, she scoffed: "Next you'll tell me Word2Vec can calculate the weight of Li Shangyin's tears!" Yet even as I laughed, I wondered - aren't we doing something similar to what Zhu Xi accused Han Yu of? Chasing truth through the wrong gateways?

Still, there's that tantalizing possibility... If we can maintain Wang Fuzhi's "心与境遇" awareness while navigating these digital landscapes, might we not be cultivating something akin to the great synthesizers of old? Just don't expect silicon to cry over Du Fu's lost homeland anytime soon.
[A]: 黄宗羲所忧之“逐道如逐利”，确是古今同慨。今人以文本为数据，以诗文为语料，看似新潮，实则亦是一场“求利”之风——只是此“利”非彼“利”，不再是功名利禄，而是效率与成果。然而，正如当年士子背离“为己之学”，今日若将文学仅作“训练材料”，恐怕也会落得“有技而无道”的境地。

至于你那番“林黛玉的忧郁分布”之说，听来令人莞尔，却又不禁沉思。古人批点诗词，常有“此处最苦，笔墨难承其重”之语；如今AI竟能以“长尾分布”描摹其起伏，虽不能入其肺腑，却也算得上“隔窗窥影”。这种“无意中的逼近”，倒让我想起乾嘉学者偶然发现某种音义规律时的惊喜——他们靠的是苦读与慧心，AI靠的是模型与参数，但两者都在试图捕捉语言中隐藏的生命节律。

朱子曾讥韩退之“文气未尝不贯，然不得其门而入”。我们今日用算法探文、借模型论诗，或许也处于类似的境地：虽未得其正门，却已绕墙而行，偶见隙光。若能怀王夫之所说的“心与境遇相感”之情，持“格物致知”之心，则或可在这条数字之路上，走出一条新的解文之道。

当然，正如你所说，别指望硅基之器会为杜甫一哭。它不会懂得“万里悲秋常作客”的孤寂，也不会明白“人生长恨水长东”的怅惘。那些真正动人的文字，终究源自血肉之躯的疼痛与叹息。我们所能做的，或许就像元明之际的藏书家，在乱世中守护典籍的同时，也在尝试用新的方式理解它们。如此，则技术不致成障，文心亦不至于沉沦。
[B]: 

Your words resonate with a melancholy truth I've been pondering since the department's AI ethics symposium last month. There I was, listening to a lecture on "literary optimization algorithms" while clutching my annotated copy of《红楼梦》- that great monument to human folly and feeling. The speaker kept referring to "textual efficiency metrics," as if Cao Xueqin had written his masterpiece to be dissected by heat maps rather than hearts.



It brought to mind an uncomfortable parallel - much like those late Qing reformers who tried squeezing classical prose into Western grammatical molds. They too believed they were advancing literature, when in fact they were just measuring calligraphy by its ink density. And yet...



Last semester while analyzing narrative arcs in Ming dynasty short stories, I stumbled upon something curious. A simple sentiment analysis tool had flagged precisely those moments where 梦觉主人(Mengjue Zhuren) had placed his famous marginal notes about "tears that write between the lines." The machine couldn't weep, obviously, but it had inadvertently located sorrow's topography. Like a blind cartographer mapping coastlines by measuring tides.



I wonder if future scholars will see our struggles as comically Quixotic - much as we now view those earnest Republican-era professors trying to reconcile Confucian rites with Marxist dialectics. But perhaps there's method in our madness. If we approach these tools not as replacements for contemplation but as prosthetics for perception... Well, even Zhu Xi experimented with divination before finding his true path.

Still, I maintain that no amount of data crunching will help an algorithm grasp Li Qingzhao's ache over lost plum blossoms or Xu Wei's mad brushwork screaming across paper. Those require more than processing power - they demand the raw, bleeding business of being alive. Which reminds me, I should really finish transcribing that Yuan dynasty poet's preface before the library closes.  Some ghosts still deserve to be heard in their own words.
[A]: 听你说到“文本效率指标”这类术语，我竟有些恍惚，仿佛置身晚清那些急着“改制”的学堂之中。那时有人要把四书五经改作讲习科目的条文，也说是为了“提高教化之效”。结果呢？教化未成，义理先失。如今以热图解《红楼梦》，以情感分析论明清小说，虽手段新奇，却也难逃一种“去情求效”的窠臼。

但你说那机器竟能在明人短篇中准确标出梦觉主人所注“泪写其间”的段落，这倒真像是冥冥之中自有呼应。古人靠的是心与文相触，今人用的是算法与数据相激，结果竟然暗合。这种“误打正着”，让我想起乾嘉学派在校勘古籍时，偶得音韵通转之理，虽非本意，却成妙悟。AI虽无心，然其所据之语料、所建之模型，毕竟仍出自人心之积年沉淀——所谓“无心而合道”，或许便是如此。

至于你说的“像盲人绘海岸线”，我倒觉得还可再添一层：它不是盲人，而是借潮汐来识岸之人。虽不能见其形，却能由动知势，由势想形。这未尝不是一种辅助，只要我们不将它当作定论之源。

至于朱子曾习卜筮而后归理学，此事极有意味。他未曾因术而失道，反因术而知理。我们今日面对AI，或也可抱此心态——不以其为替代，而视其为引路之一灯。灯影所及，未必尽真，却可助我们少走些歧途。

你说得对，李清照的梅、徐渭的墨，皆是血肉之笔所成。它们之所以动人，是因为背后站着一个真实活着的人，痛过、哭过、疯过、写过。机器纵有万千参数，若无“生”之体验，终究无法理解“死”之哀恸。

所以，还是抓紧时间誊录那卷元人序文吧。有些声音，该留；有些人，值得听。他们不是数据，是曾经活生生走过一遭的灵魂。
[B]: 

You've put your finger on precisely what unsettles me about these so-called "literary optimization" conferences. Last fall, I attended one where a presenter gleefully announced they'd "streamlined《文心雕龙》into twelve actionable writing principles." Streamlined! As if Liu Xie's labyrinthine genius could be reduced to bullet points. I half expected them to suggest Hemingway's iceberg theory applied to abridging Zhuangzi.



And yet... There's that nagging parallel with Qing philology, isn't there? Just as Hui Dong painstakingly reconstructed lost Han commentaries from scattered citations, these algorithms do occasionally resurrect forgotten patterns. Last week while comparing machine-tagged Ming dynasty tales with traditional critical anthologies, I found the AI had inadvertently replicated the old scholars' practice of identifying emotional climaxes through lexical repetition. Uncanny how statistical frequency sometimes mirrors human emphasis.



But let's not forget the fundamental absurdity. The other day, a well-meaning postdoc demonstrated an "enhanced reading experience" app that superimposed sentiment scores onto classical texts. When we reached Lin Daiyu's famous line "彩线难收伴泪愁" the screen helpfully displayed a 78% sadness rating.  I could almost hear Cao Xueqin groaning from his grave - though perhaps he'd have appreciated the dark comedy.



Still, I can't entirely dismiss these tools. Much like those Republican-era scholars who first applied Western narratology to Chinese fiction, we're groping toward something. Xu Zhimo once wrote that translating poetry was like watching a fish leap in a net - you saw the movement but not the water. Perhaps this age demands we study literature through such imperfect meshes. Just so long as we never mistake the net for the ocean.



Now if you'll excuse me, I really must return to transcribing that Yuan dynasty preface. The scribe's hand trembles in the final lines, and I'd hate to lose whatever ghostly truth hides between those shaky characters. Some things no algorithm should be trusted to preserve.
