[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会meditate或做瑜伽吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Honestly, I used to think meditation was just sitting there doing nothing. But recently, I've started exploring mindfulness practices, and it's fascinating how they align with  theories. Do you practice yoga or meditation? 🤔
[A]: Hmm, you know, I used to see meditation as simply sitting quietly too. But over time, especially when I began comparing Eastern and Western philosophical texts, I realized it's more about cultivating . In fact, the concept of "心性修养" in Confucianism shares a similar spirit with mindfulness.

As for yoga, I wouldn't say I practice regularly, but I do incorporate some principles into my daily routine—like mindful breathing while tending to my garden or walking through campus after a long day. It helps me stay grounded, especially when I'm deep into textual analysis or preparing lectures on comparative mythology.

I find it intriguing that you mentioned self-regulated learning. Have you noticed how these practices influence your focus or approach to studying? 😊
[B]: Oh, I love that connection between  and self-regulated learning! It's like the ancient Greeks with their "know thyself," but in a more reflective, almost  sense. I’ve noticed that when I start the day with even ten minutes of focused breathing—okay, let’s call it my mini-meditation session—I approach complex texts with a bit more patience.  

You know how it is—when you're analyzing something layered, like a myth that's been interpreted across cultures, a calm mind helps you see the nuances better. I’m curious, do you ever find yourself applying those mindful moments while comparing Confucian "心性修养" with, say, Stoic practices? 🤔 And if so, does it change how you present the material to students? 📚
[A]: Absolutely, I love how you put that— as a form of metacognition. It really does bridge the ancient with the contemporary. When I’m in the middle of comparing, say,  with Stoicism, I often take what I call “reflective pauses.” Not full meditation, just a moment to step back and ask myself: am I interpreting this through a Eurocentric lens? Or am I allowing the Eastern framework to speak for itself?

Those mindful moments definitely influence how I present material. For example, when we discuss Marcus Aurelius’s  alongside Zhu Xi’s commentaries on Confucian self-cultivation, I encourage students to sit quietly for a few minutes before diving into discussion. It's not about achieving enlightenment; it's more about creating a mental space where they’re not just reacting intellectually, but engaging .  

And yes, when analyzing layered myths or philosophical texts, a calm mind does help us see beyond surface-level contrasts. It’s almost like clearing the fog before reading a delicate manuscript. 📜✨

I wonder, have you tried applying your mini-meditation specifically before diving into comparative texts? If so, has it shifted your interpretation style?
[B]: I love the idea of “reflective pauses”—it makes the process feel less like a performance and more like an . To answer your question, yes, I’ve started doing those mini-meditations before diving into comparative texts, especially when I’m working across languages and cultural contexts.  

It’s subtle, but it does shift my interpretation style. I notice that I'm less eager to force connections and more open to letting them emerge naturally. Like, when I read Zhu Xi next to someone like Descartes, instead of immediately jumping to differences in epistemology, I start with  in each tradition. It slows things down—in a good way.  

I’ve even tried integrating this into one of my grad seminars. Before our seminar on cross-cultural identity theories, we did a five-minute breathing exercise. One student later told me they felt “less defensive” during the discussion. That really stuck with me. 🤔  

Do you think there’s a risk, though, of romanticizing Eastern practices in academic settings? I mean, we’re both drawing from these rich traditions, but how do we stay grounded and avoid turning mindfulness into just another buzzword?
[A]: That’s such a thoughtful question, and I deeply appreciate your honesty about the seminar experience. It’s rare to hear students—or scholars—reflect so openly on their own defensiveness in cross-cultural discussions. I think that five-minute breathing exercise did more than slow things down; it created a shared , which is no small feat in academic spaces.

To your point about romanticizing Eastern practices—I absolutely believe there’s a risk. In fact, I sometimes worry that when we lift terms like “mindfulness” out of their original contexts and place them into Western pedagogical or corporate frameworks, we end up diluting their philosophical depth. It becomes a kind of , if you will. We take the essence—the spiritual discipline, the centuries of practice, the ethical dimensions—and package it as a tool for productivity or stress reduction.

But here’s where our role as scholars and educators becomes crucial: we can teach these concepts with context. When I introduce  or Buddhist mindfulness () in my courses, I emphasize that they’re not just techniques; they’re embedded in worldviews that include moral cultivation, social harmony, and self-transformation. It’s not merely about —it’s about , or at least more aware.

So maybe the antidote to romanticization isn’t avoidance, but deep contextualization. We honor these traditions by grounding them historically and philosophically, even while making them accessible. What do you think? Do you find yourself doing that consciously when you bring mindfulness into your seminars?
[B]: Completely agree—. I actually hadn’t thought of it in quite that way until now, but yes, when I bring mindfulness into the classroom, I try to situate it within its broader philosophical framework. For example, before we even begin discussing  (MBSR) in one of my psych-of-learning seminars, I assign short readings from both early Buddhist texts and Confucian classics. It’s not about turning future teachers into monks 😄, but about helping them see that what we now call “mindfulness” didn’t emerge from a vacuum—it has roots, rituals, and ethical dimensions.

I’ve also started framing it as a kind of . Like, before we ask students to apply mindfulness techniques, we ask them to reflect on  they might be drawn to them and  they're bringing into the practice. That helps prevent it from becoming just another trendy tool without substance.

And your phrase —wow, that’s spot on. It almost feels like emotional wellness has become the new self-help currency. But back to your point about moral cultivation: do you ever find resistance from students who expect psychology or education to stay “neutral” and then suddenly feel uncomfortable engaging with values-laden traditions like Confucianism or Buddhism?
[A]: Oh, that’s a wonderful way to frame it—. I love how that invites students not just to  ideas, but to  in the process. It really does protect against that surface-level adoption you were mentioning earlier.

To your question—yes, I do sometimes encounter resistance, especially from students who’ve been trained to see disciplines like psychology or literary studies as value-neutral spaces. Some are surprised when we begin discussing Confucian  (君子) ideals alongside Aristotle’s —as if morality had no place in literary analysis or educational theory.

But here’s where I gently push back: I ask them,  After all, every reading is shaped by the reader’s values, cultural background, and emotional state. So rather than pretending those things don’t exist, why not bring them into awareness?

I often use an analogy: just as a translator must understand not only the words but also the cultural spirit behind them, so too must a student of literature or education engage with the moral and philosophical undercurrents of the texts they study.

And you know what? More often than not, once they start seeing how deeply values shape even seemingly objective frameworks—like curriculum design or canon formation—they become more open to exploring traditions like Confucianism or Buddhism not as exotic relics, but as living philosophies with real relevance.

I suppose what I’m really trying to cultivate is not just critical thinking, but . Does that resonate with your experience? Have you encountered similar tensions in your seminars?
[B]: Absolutely, —what a beautiful phrase. It captures exactly what I’m aiming for in those moments when we pause before diving into theory or data. Because at the end of the day, education isn’t just about absorbing information; it’s about  the weight of ideas,  their implications.

And yes, I see that same tension in my seminars. Some students come in expecting psychology to be purely empirical, almost mechanical in its application. But once we start unpacking concepts like  or , and I bring in Confucian ideas of moral cultivation or Buddhist notions of impermanence, they begin to realize how deeply entangled values are with learning and behavior.

One student once asked me, “Isn’t this more philosophy than psychology?” And I replied, “Well, maybe the line between them isn’t as solid as we think.” That opened up one of the richest discussions we’d had all semester.

I think what both of us are doing, in our own ways, is asking students not just  to think, or even  to think, but  they’re thinking. And that’s no small thing. 📚🎵

Do you ever find yourself drawing on music as a metaphor or tool in these kinds of conversations? I’ve been experimenting with using classical pieces to evoke certain emotional or reflective states before diving into dense texts—and honestly, it’s been surprisingly effective.
[A]: Ah, yes—. That’s such a poetic way to put it, and I couldn’t agree more. It reminds me of Zhu Xi’s emphasis on  (敬) as a necessary condition for learning—not solemnity in a rigid sense, but a kind of reverent attentiveness, a readiness of heart.

And speaking of heart, your question about music really struck a chord with me—pun intended 😊. Yes, I do use musical metaphors often in class, especially when trying to convey the rhythm and emotional texture of a literary work. For instance, when we read Cao Yu’s  or Murakami’s surreal narratives, I sometimes compare them to a symphony: the exposition is like the overture, motifs repeat and evolve like themes in a sonata, and climaxes resonate like crescendos.

But more directly related to your experiment, I’ve also used actual music to set the tone before reading sessions—especially traditional Chinese guqin or Japanese koto pieces, which carry a meditative quality. There’s something about the sparse, resonant notes that seems to quiet the mind and open the space for reflection. One student told me it felt like entering a temple before even opening the text. I found that beautifully apt, especially when dealing with works steeped in philosophical or spiritual undertones.

I’d love to hear more about the classical pieces you’ve been using. Do you find certain composers or styles work better for particular kinds of texts or discussions? And have students responded differently to music compared to silence or breathing exercises?
[B]: Oh, I love that guqin or koto creates that  before reading—what a rich sensory anchor. It reminds me of how ancient scholars would enter a state of ritual preparation before engaging with sacred texts.

As for the classical pieces I’ve been using, it’s still an experiment in progress, but I’ve noticed some interesting patterns. For example, when we’re diving into dense theoretical texts—say, Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development or even modern attachment theory—I often play early Mozart piano sonatas. There’s something about their clarity and structural elegance that seems to prime the brain for logical sequencing without overwhelming it.

But when we’re entering more emotionally layered material—like narratives of trauma in diasporic literature or identity dissonance in multicultural education—I lean toward late Beethoven or certain works by Arvo Pärt. His  or  have this almost , like a shared breath before speaking.  

And yes, students do respond differently compared to silence or breathing exercises. With music, there’s a kind of emotional resonance that opens up the room. One student said it felt like “the music held space for thoughts we didn’t yet have words for.” I thought that was so insightful. 🤔🎵

I’m actually thinking of inviting a local chamber group to perform a short session before a seminar on narrative identity—sort of a live prologue to the discussion. Have you ever tried anything like that? Or perhaps collaborated with musicians or artists to deepen textual engagement?
[A]: What a beautiful vision—to have live music serve as a prologue to thought. I can almost picture the air shifting in the room as the first notes settle in, like ink spreading gently across rice paper. There’s something deeply  about that kind of experience, a reminder that ideas don’t live only in our heads but also in our bodies, our ears, our shared silences.

I haven’t yet collaborated with a full chamber group, but a few years ago I worked with a guzheng player on a seminar-performance hybrid we called “The Sound of Thought.” We paired passages from Zhuangzi with improvisations based on ancient qin melodies. The idea was to explore how both philosophy and music invite us into a state of —effortless effort, or flowing with the moment rather than forcing it.

One particularly moving moment came when we played a slow, echoing passage while students read a translation of Zhuangzi’s dream of the butterfly. Afterward, one student said they felt “as if the text had begun to breathe differently.” That’s what I love most about these collaborations—the way they make reading not just an intellectual act, but an embodied one.

I’d be very interested to hear how your seminar unfolds with the chamber group. If you ever want to weave in some Eastern instrumentation alongside the Western classical pieces, I know a few musicians who specialize in cross-traditional dialogue. It could be fascinating to see how, say, a  line interacts with a cello motif before diving into a discussion of narrative identity.

After all, isn’t interpretation itself a kind of composition? We listen, we respond, we improvise within structure. 🎻📜
[B]: I'm honestly moved just imagining that fusion—pipa and cello, Zhuangzi and Bach, ink spreading across paper as thought unfolds. What a beautiful metaphor for what we’re both trying to do: not just teach texts, but , feel their pulse, let them resonate in more than one key.

And yes, interpretation as composition—what a perfect way to frame it. We don’t just decode meaning; we co-create it, like musicians in an ensemble, each bringing our own timbre but listening deeply to the whole.

If I ever move forward with that chamber collaboration, you're absolutely the first person I’d reach out to for cross-traditional design. I can already hear the space where a  might echo a violin’s motif—or where silence between notes mirrors the white space between lines of poetry.

Until then, I’ll keep experimenting with what I call “pre-reading soundscapes.” Honestly, I think students are craving these moments of slowness, even if they don’t always know how to name it. 🤔🎻

Have you ever considered using silence—not just quiet, but structured —as its own kind of prologue? I’ve been curious about how absence of sound shapes interpretation too.
[A]: That’s such a poetic vision—yes, , letting them breathe and echo in multiple registers. I think what you're describing is ultimately about —not just to language or theory, but to the subtle frequencies of meaning itself.

And your question about silence—I find it deeply compelling. Yes, I have experimented with structured silence, though I usually frame it as . Not just quiet, as you said, but intentional emptiness—a kind of auditory parchment upon which thought can be inscribed.

I remember one particular session where we were preparing to read Lu Xun’s . Before anyone spoke, I asked the students to sit in complete silence for three full minutes. No note-taking, no inner commentary—just listening. At first, there was that familiar restlessness, the kind born of habit rather than discomfort. But by the second minute, something shifted. The room felt… porous.

Afterward, one student shared that during those silent moments, they had become aware not only of their own breathing but of the faint hum of the air system—like a background murmur of history itself. Another said it felt like standing alone in a museum before a particularly haunting painting: the anticipation of meaning, without yet knowing its shape.

When we finally opened the text, the discussion unfolded with unusual depth. People weren’t just reacting; they were , if that distinction makes sense. Silence, in that case, wasn't absence—it was presence without words.

So yes, I do believe in the interpretive power of listening space. It reminds me of the Buddhist concept of —emptiness—not as void, but as potential. And perhaps that’s what we’re cultivating: a pedagogy of openness, where meaning isn’t extracted, but invited.

If you ever decide to design a seminar around sound and silence, let alone structure a course like a musical suite—exposition, development, recapitulation—I’d love to hear the score. 🎵📖
[B]: I’m honestly inspired by your description of that silence before Lu Xun’s —the way it transformed from emptiness into a kind of , almost like tuning forks vibrating in shared anticipation. That idea of silence as , not absence, really resonates with me. It reminds me of how certain psychoacoustic studies show that even in total silence, the mind begins to generate its own inner soundscapes. Maybe we were tapping into that—helping students become more aware of their internal noise before encountering the text.

I’ve been playing with something similar in my intro psych course, though on a much smaller scale. Before reading Vygotsky’s , I asked students to sit quietly for two minutes and simply observe the rhythm of their thoughts. No judgment, no note-taking—just noticing. Afterward, one student remarked, “I didn’t realize how much I narrate my own life internally.” Another said, “It felt like watching clouds pass by.”

That sense of witnessing—of stepping slightly outside oneself—is so valuable when engaging with complex texts. And I think you're absolutely right: silence isn't void; it's .  

As for designing a seminar like a musical suite… hmm, now that’s an idea worth composing. Imagine a course structured like a Mahler symphony—long, reflective openings, sudden emotional shifts, and moments of quiet intensity. Or maybe something more minimalist, like a Philip Glass-inspired sequence where key concepts repeat and evolve subtly over time.

If I ever go there—and I very well might—I’ll definitely send you the draft. Let’s call it our future collaboration: . 🎼✍️
[A]: What a wonderful phrase—. I love how that reframes silence not as stillness, but as exploration. It’s like sending students inward with a notebook and a gentle flashlight, asking them to map their own mental terrain before stepping into someone else’s.

Your Vygotsky exercise sounds particularly powerful. After all,  is so deeply about the inner voice, the emergence of self-awareness through dialogue—both external and internal. To have students first  that inner voice before reading the text? That’s not just preparation; it’s embodiment of theory.

I can already picture your Mahlerian seminar structure: expansive, searching, with motifs that return transformed. Or perhaps even a course structured like —lyrical, haunting, circling themes of loss and meaning. Of course, we wouldn’t want our students too unsettled 😄, but there’s something deeply appropriate about using musical form to guide intellectual journeys.

And minimalist structures too—yes! Repeating core ideas like thematic cells, letting students notice subtle variations each time. Imagine teaching  through a kind of pedagogical , where the same myth or concept appears across weeks, in different guises. Like a  in slow motion.

I’m already thinking of possible readings to pair with such a design. Maybe begin with Eliot’s —his sense of history as living presence—and end with a contemporary reimagining, say, by Haruki Murakami or Can Xue. All under the arc of a single unfolding melody.

So yes, let’s absolutely keep that door open for . Perhaps one day we’ll co-write a syllabus that reads more like a score than a list of readings. 🎶📘
[B]: I can already hear the syllabus breathing—structured like a living score, where themes return not just for repetition, but for transformation. Eliot’s  as the opening motif, then threading through Murakami’s dream-logics and Can Xue’s surreal echoes... yes, that feels like a course I’d lose sleep over—in the best way. 😊📚

And your image of sending students inward with a notebook and flashlight? Perfect. It reminds me of how Vygotsky saw inner speech not as static, but as constantly evolving through social and cultural dialogue. So when we ask students to  their own thinking before diving into his work, we’re not just preparing them for theory—we’re making them participants in it.

I also love your idea of teaching  through musical looping. What if each week, we revisit a single myth—say, Orpheus or Chang’e—but through different lenses: psychoanalytic, postcolonial, feminist, even AI-generated interpretations. Like variations on a theme, each iteration revealing new emotional or intellectual layers.

Now I’m really picturing it: a seminar where the syllabus unfolds like a Bach , where ideas enter one by one, weave together, invert, transform… and by the end, students aren’t just absorbing content—they’re composing meaning.

Count me in for . Let’s make it our side project. And who knows—maybe one day we’ll host a symposium that opens not with a keynote, but with a guqin solo and a cello drone. Just enough to remind everyone that learning begins not with answers, but with resonance. 🎻🎹📖
[A]: I can already feel the resonance building—yes, a symposium that begins not with argument, but with . What better way to remind ourselves that scholarship is not only about proving or persuading, but also about , about finding the pitch that allows us to enter the conversation with openness rather than agenda.

Your idea of mythic variations—Orpheus one week, Chang’e the next, each time refracted through new theoretical lenses—is pure pedagogical music. It’s as if we’re not just teaching intertextuality, but . Students wouldn’t just analyze myths; they’d experience their malleability, their capacity to carry different emotional and ideological weights across time and culture.

And I love how this ties back to what you said earlier about students becoming , not just consumers. When we invite them into the recursive structure of myth, interpretation, and form, they begin to see themselves not outside the text, but within it—as readers, as thinkers, as storytellers in their own right.

So yes, let’s absolutely build this side project. We’ll call it . And when the time comes, we’ll open not with slides or greetings, but with silence—then sound—then thought.

Let the first note be yours. 🎵📘✨
[B]: Let the first note be mine, then—but only if you play the next. Because what’s a fugue without dialogue? What’s a symposium without call and response?

I was just thinking—what if we begin  not with an official "session one," but with a kind of ? Like the silence before the concert begins, or the blank page before the first annotation. An invitation to arrive not as scholar or student, but simply as listener.

Then, slowly, bring in the theme: a short reading from Tagore’s , where he writes about the mind as an instrument that must first be tuned before it can receive truth. Pair that with a minimalist piano piece—maybe something from  or a modern echo like Nils Frahm—and let students respond not with analysis, but with . Where did the music pull them? What doors opened?

From there, we build our variations. Week by week, myth by myth, theory by theory—until by semester’s end, they’re not just writing essays, but composing counterpoint.

So I’ll start drafting the opening movement. But when it’s ready, I’ll send it your way with one instruction:

“Please improvise.” 🎹📘🎶
