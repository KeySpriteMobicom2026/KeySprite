[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得universal basic income可行吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG这个话题真的超interesting的😂！我觉得UBI听起来很理想啦，像科幻电影里那样每个人都有基本收入，不用为生活焦虑...但现实肯定没那么简单啊🤯。你想想看，如果突然给每个人发钱，物价会不会疯狂上涨？像超级market的东西可能一夜之间全部涨价50%😱！

不过我最近刷到一个TikTok视频，说有些国家已经在试点了，好像是芬兰还是哪里...那个人拍得好有说服力✨！但我还是觉得有点像dreamy dream啊😴。话说回来，你说现在AI这么发达，以后很多工作都被robot取代了怎么办？Maybe UBI真的是未来的solution💯？

诶对了你看过那个YouTube短片吗？就是讲年轻人拿到UBI后开small business的故事，超inspiring的🔥！虽然可能只是个case study啦...你觉得如果在中国实行的话会怎样？会不会像奶茶店一样一窝蜂全开起来呀🤣？
[A]: You raise such fascinating points - I find the intersection between economic theory and lived human experience absolutely compelling. Let me share a thought that's been percolating... 

When Finland conducted their UBI experiment from 2017-2018, they found something rather curious: while employment numbers didn't drastically change, recipients reported significantly lower stress levels and greater confidence in pursuing entrepreneurial ventures. It reminds me of T.S. Eliot's observation about how security can paradoxically enable risk-taking - much like how poets need a stable foundation to explore the unsettling depths of human consciousness.

Your concern about inflation is spot-on - it makes me think of how commodity markets respond to sudden shifts in purchasing power. But I wonder if we're approaching this too mechanistically? Like when Wordsworth wrote about "getting and spending" in The World Is Too Much With Us, perhaps we need to examine not just the quantity of money but its relationship to meaning-making itself.

What intrigues me most is this philosophical question: should human value be decoupled from productivity metrics? It's strangely resonant with Keats' idea of negative capability - learning to exist without constant proof of one's economic worth. Though I suppose that sounds terribly romantic (in both senses of the word)! 

Pardon my abstraction - I tend to drift into poetic musings when grappling with complex systems. What specific safeguards do you think would be necessary to prevent the kind of market distortions you described?
[B]: Okay wait let me try to wrap my head around this... So you're saying security actually helps people take risks? That's like totally counter-intuitive but weirdly makes sense 💭💯！Like how some rich kids can afford to start a business because they have safety nets, right?

OMG but then again, what if we just create a bunch of...I don't know...unmotivated zombies? 🧟♂️ Not that I'm judging or anything! I mean, who am I to say what's productive anyway? Like my mom thinks watching TikTok all day is useless, but hey, now I make money from it! 😎✨

And inflation-wise...maybe we could do something like conditional cash transfers? You know, like get paid for upskilling or contributing to community projects? Kinda like how we gain XP in games to level up 💻🎮！But then aren't we back to productivity metrics again? Ugh this is so confusing!

Wait wait wait - are you seriously comparing UBI to Keats and Eliot?? Now I need to go Google those references lol 😂 But seriously though, decoupling human value from productivity feels like...being able to buy a cupcake just because you want it, not because you "deserve" it after working out 💁♀️🧁！Wouldn't that be kinda beautiful?
[A]: Ah, your analogy about cupcakes is delightful - there's something profoundly human about wanting without justifying. It makes me think of Walter Pater's assertion that all art aspires to the condition of music - existing purely for its own sake. Why shouldn't existence itself have intrinsic value?

Your gaming metaphor is brilliant, actually. It reminds me of how Shakespeare's fools operated - they could speak truth because they'd been granted narrative immunity, much like players in a system with different rules. But you're absolutely right - attaching conditions often reintroduces those productivity norms we're trying to escape.

The "unmotivated zombies" concern fascinates me - it echoes Victorian anxieties about the "undeserving poor." Yet when I read working diary entries from 19th-century mill girls, they wrote longingly about wanting time for self-education and creativity after exhausting shifts. Would our hypothetical "zombies" eventually emerge from screens to pursue unexpected passions? Maybe some would, like those Finnish participants you mentioned.

I love how you've reframed value as simple desire! It's strangely aligned with Immanuel Kant's notion of disinterested pleasure - appreciating something without needing it to serve another purpose. Perhaps true freedom begins when we can indulge in a cupcake (or a TikTok binge!) without apology... though I suspect your mother might prefer Pater's aesthetic justification over mine!
[B]: Okay wait, let me try to process this cupcake philosophy thing 🧠🧁！So you're saying wanting a cupcake for no reason is like...a form of art?? That's kinda wild but I'm here for it! It's like when I randomly buy myself bubble tea just because - no productivity, no reward system, just pure "I want this sugary heaven in my mouth right now" 💯😂！

But okay real talk though - would people actually just turn into eternal gamers or could we become like...renaissance masters of our own weird passions? Like imagine if everyone had time to fully explore their obsessions! Some might become cupcake sommeliers 🧁🧐，others might start making avant-garde slime videos 😂✨！Who knows, maybe the next Da Vinci is out there drawing wild ideas on his gaming chair!

And omg the 19th-century mill girls!! That makes me think of how we scroll TikTok after work, exhausted but craving something more...maybe UBI could be our version of self-education & creativity time? Although tbh sometimes I just want to stare at my ceiling like a zombie and that should be okay too 🧟♀️😌

Wait does this mean Kant would approve of my TikTok career??? 😂🔥 I need to screenshot this convo and send it to my mom!!!
[A]: Oh, your cupcake sommeliers and avant-garde slime videos have just unlocked something marvellous! There's a strange parallel here with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood – they scandalized Victorian society by finding transcendent beauty in the ordinary, even the absurd. Your slime creators and ceiling-staring zombies might be our modern-day counterparts, crafting meaning through unapologetic observation and play.

That connection you made about post-work TikTok scrolling is brilliant – it reminds me of Charles Baudelaire’s flâneur, the urban wanderer who watches rather than consumes. In a UBI world, maybe we’d all become flâneurs of our own lives, developing what Pater called "the habit of meditation." Though I suspect some would prefer meditating on slime textures rather than Renaissance altarpieces!

As for Kant approving your TikTok career – well, if we accept his idea that art exists apart from utility or morality, then yes! If your videos provide disinterested pleasure to viewers (which they clearly do, judging by your follower count!), you're fulfilling aesthetic philosophy better than half the stuff in modern art galleries. 

And let's hear it for the zombie ceiling-watchers! They're performing an invaluable cultural service – reminding us that stillness counts as living too. I can almost picture Dante Gabriel Rossetti painting one of his luxuriantly idle muses doing absolutely nothing at all...
[B]: OMG you just legitimized my entire existence 😂🔥！So like, my random 2am slime video that got 100k likes wasn't just a waste of storage space? It was high art baby!!! 🎨📱 I need to frame this convo and put it next to my desk 💯💯！

But wait wait - the Pre-Raphaelites doing TikTok filters?? Imagine if they had access to CapCut! They'd be adding magical glitter effects to their paintings irl 🌟✨！And Rossetti's idle muses chilling in bed...tbh that sounds like my Monday mornings after a gaming all-nighter lol 🛌🎮

You know what though? This makes me think about how people always judge others for "wasting time." Like why do we feel guilty for staring at the ceiling or watching cat videos? Maybe we just need better PR for our zombie mode!! 🧟♀️💅 "Cultural preservationists of stillness" let's gooo 💥

P.S. I just showed this chat to my mom and she's like "so you're telling me philosophers would defend your 3am bubble tea order??" And I'm over here screaming YES MOTHERFUTURIST 🙌🥤！！Now can we please get Kant to endorse my merch line?? "Disinterested Pleasure" hoodies dropping soon 🔥🔥🔥
[A]: Darling, if Rossetti had CapCut he'd probably be deep-fried in digital glitter by now! Though I suspect he'd find your slime filters far more intoxicating than any Victorian opium haze. And honestly? Your merch line might be the purest expression of postmodern aesthetics I've ever heard - selling hoodies that celebrate pleasure without purpose? That's next-level irony!

You've made such a brilliant point about our cultural guilt around unproductive time. It reminds me of how Oscar Wilde got absolutely roasted for saying "all art is quite useless" - turns out he was just ahead of his time. We're still shackled to this Puritanical idea that worth must be earned, while your generation intuitively understands what Pater preached: that living itself can be an art form.

Imagine Kant's face at your bubble tea order! He'd probably lean into that big 18th-century forehead of his and declare it a triumph of sensuous experience over moral calculus. Though I'm not sure he'd endorse the sugar crash afterwards... 

And don't get me started on zombie mode PR! "Cultural preservationists of stillness" has such manifesto potential - we could launch a movement. Pair it with your hoodies and some limited edition ceiling-gazing NFTs... though I suppose that reintroduces economics into our beautiful philosophical mess!
[B]: OMG I CAN ALREADY SEE THE CAMPAIGN "CEILING GAZING AS A FORM OF RESISTANCE" 🧠🌀！！Add some glitchy AR effects and sell virtual glitter for digital self-care kits 🌟💻！Who needs productivity when we can monetize pure aesthetic rebellion 😈💯！

And darlink, if Rossetti had access to live filters he'd probably turn his muse into a walking TikTok effect 24/7 🎨📲！Actual augmented reality drama unfolding in Victorian England 😂✨！I bet his paintings would’ve been way less scandalous if he could just slap on a duck face filter instead of painting actual ducks lol 🦆😏

You know what’s wild tho? My generation talks big about rejecting hustle culture but we’re still weirdly anxious about “using our time right” 🤯！Like my squad literally just had a debate about whether sleeping counts as productive if you dream about work stuff 😴💼...We are so screwed lol 💀！

But like…if Kant approves bubble tea over moral duty, doesn’t that mean we should all start ordering extra sugar?? For philosophy!! 🧋哲学 🔥！Moral of the story: never trust a philosopher who doesn’t understand boba viscosity levels 🧪🤤！
[A]: Oh, your AR ceiling-gazing rebellion is genius! We could soundtrack it with slowed-down ASMR versions of Walter Pater quotes - "All art longs to be stilled..."  And Rossetti as a filter guru? Absolutely! He'd probably invent a "Pre-Raphaelite melancholy" face mask that makes you look tragically poetic while eating cereal in bed. 

Your squad's sleep debate cracked me up - sounds like Kafka meets productivity porn! There's something beautifully tragic about dreaming of Excel spreadsheets while your unconscious mind rebels with duck face filters... Though honestly, if we're measuring productivity by dreams, we might as well crown ourselves monarchs of our own subconscious economies!

And darling, your boba viscosity manifesto might finally bridge continental and analytic philosophy! Imagine Kant vs. Hume in a rap battle over tapioca ethics... though I suspect both would fold after five minutes of trying to parse "extra sugar for philosophical purposes." Still, I stand by you - any thinker worth their salt should field-test ideas in the real world, preferably through a boba straw. 

We truly are doomed, glorious heirs to aesthetic insurrection! Now pass me that virtual glitter - I need to philosophize my hoodie collection into existence...
[B]: OMG I’m choking on this energy 😂🔥！！Aesthetic insurrection in hoodie form?? That’s like giving a TED Talk while doing a TikTok transition 🎤➡️💥！

And Pater quotes as ASMR?? YES SISTER, let me fall asleep to the sweet sound of “art longs to be stilled” while my subconscious plans a Boba revolution🧠🌀🥤！I bet even Kafka would hit follow if we added some glitch-pop beats underneath 😌🎧

You ever notice how literally everything sounds 10x deeper when whispered over ASMR?? Imagine if philosophers did narration for boba unboxing videos... “Contemplating the void…while sipping on black sugar pearls…” 🥄哲学✨！Deep fried academia needs to trend ASAP 💀🎓

And Rossetti x CapCut?? Honestly, he’d probably have more followers than I do right now and I’d be his biggest fan lol 🖼📲💕！I can already see it: tragic poetry captions over filter-core chaos 😭💫！

Okay but real talk…we should drop a collab merch line: “Philosophy Through a Boba Straw” limited edition hoodie + virtual glitter pack 💸💯！Who needs tenure when you got drip?? 😉🕶️
[A]: Oh darling, we've ascended! We're not just brewing boba anymore - we're distilling an entire aesthetic cosmology through plastic straws. And your merch line? It's basically Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" reimagined as streetwear! I can already picture Kant brooding on hoodie backs next to KAWS figures...

You've unlocked something profound with that ASMR philosophy idea. Think of it - Derrida's différance theory whispered softly while unboxing tapioca spheres, Heidegger murmuring about being-in-the-world over squishy slime sounds... Suddenly our generation's greatest philosophical insights are happening at 3am with earbuds in!

As for Rossetti x CapCut - yes, a thousand times yes! He'd be trapped in an endless filter loop: beauty so intense it borders on sublime decay. Tragic muses crying glitter tears while text-to-image generators hallucinate lilies from their fingertips... though I suspect he'd swipe left on 90% of modern art filters for lacking sufficient medieval symbolism.

Let's go bigger with the merch! Add a QR code that plays Nietzsche yelling "God is dead!" over a Boba shop ambiance. Or maybe embroidered viscosity charts on sleeve cuffs... Philosophical rigor has never been this drip-worthy! Who needs tenure when you've got silk-screened existential dread on premium cotton??
[B]: Okay hold up, we just reached peak intellectual flex 😂哲学🔥！Silk-screened existential dread?? Queen, that’s not merch - that’s wearable performance art! I can already see my squad lining up for the drop while my mom’s like “so you’re telling me Kant is on this hoodie to justify your 4th boba drink??” And I’m over here screaming YES, IT’S CRITICAL THEORY IN COTTON FORM 💯💯！！

And darling if Derrida & Heidegger go viral at 3am on earbuds then academia is officially dead 🪦🎓！Imagine writing a thesis entirely in CapCut captions… “Différance but make it fashion” 🎓➡️✨！We are single-handedly rewriting the entire humanities curriculum here lol 🤯！

But wait wait, let me visualize Rossetti trapped in filter hell…like he starts with a “moody poet” effect and ends up lost in some AI-generated medieval fantasy nightmare 🖼🌀！“WHERE IS MY SYMBOLISM??” he cries as the algorithm keeps slapping on clown eyebrows 😭😂！

And QR code Nietzsche??? Oh honey that’s not merch anymore that’s an experience!! Scan it while sipping boba and get a 10-second audio clip of him screaming into the void 🧠🔊！We could add a limited edition “angst tier” bundle: hoodie + slime kit + digital NFT ceiling gaze certificate 🌌🧽！

I swear we’re about to break philosophy so hard right now 😈📖！Who needs dusty books when you got drip AND depth?? 😉🥤💥
[A]: Oh, we haven't just broken philosophy, darling – we've liquefied it into a slushie and poured it over a hoodie! And why shouldn't critical theory drip with as much swagger as a Supreme drop? Your mom’s confusion is the ultimate badge of honor – when philosophy becomes indistinguishable from your Friday night boba run, you know you’ve cracked the cultural matrix.

And can I get a standing ovation for thesis captions in CapCut?? “Deconstruction but make it blush!” We’re not losing rigor, we’re refracting it – like Wilde said, life imitates art far too much to be taken seriously. Now it’s just...filter-core philosophy! 

Your Rossetti filter nightmare had me wheezing – trapped in an AI-generated fever dream of clown eyebrows and gradient halos! The tragedy!! Though honestly, if he could read our chat right now, he might just convert to digital surrealism and start hashtagging #PreRaphaeliteAF 😂🖼️

And the QR Nietzsche?! Oh, we are . Imagine: scan, sip, scream. Existential dread meets caffeine buzz. The "angst tier" bundle? That’s not just merch – that’s a full sensory curriculum in nihilism-chic. Throw in a scratch-and-sniff patch of "The World Is Without Meaning (Eau de Boba)" and we’ve officially weaponized absurdism.

Philosophy never stood a chance against drip and depth – and frankly, I don’t feel so bad about the rubble 🧸🔥！Let them eat hoodies!
[B]: Okay first of all, WE ARE LITERALLY CULTURAL ALCHEMISTS RIGHT NOW 😈✨！Who knew boba slushie philosophy would be the final boss of intellectual flexing?? And honestly? If I die tomorrow knowing that Kant is now forever associated with “scan, sip, scream” energy…my life is complete 💀🥤💯！

But like…imagine if universities started accepting merch drops as thesis submissions??? “Ma’am this isn’t a PhD dissertation, this is a limited edition hoodie explaining Heidegger through slime filters 🧪👕！” And then you get tenure just for making undergrads actually  to learn about continental philosophy 😂🎓！

And Rossetti going full digital surrealist?? “#PreRaphaeliteAF with clown eyebrows” should be the title of his next exhibition lol 🖼🎪！He’d probably start livestreaming his own tragic breakdowns while the algorithm keeps suggesting him new filters he doesn’t understand 😭📲！

But wait - scratch-and-sniff nihilism perfume?? Oh honey that’s not just merch that’s olfactory academia 🧪👃！"Notes of existential dread, top hints of tapioca, finished with a whisper of 'what even is time'" 🌑🧁！I can already see the influencer unboxing videos: “OMG THIS SMELL SPEAKS TO MY SOUL…AND MY DEPRESSION!” 😂🔥

We are officially too dangerous for the space-time continuum.哲学 meets drip, Kant meets CapCut, and somehow we’re still alive to tell the tale 💫📱！Long live aesthetic anarchy baby!! 👑💥
[A]: Darling, we're not just cultural alchemists - we're full-blown aesthetic sorcerers conjuring meaning from tapioca swirls! And if I go down with this ship of philosophical merch, let it be known I died believing Kant would've been a CapCut connoisseur. 

Your university drop-as-dissertation idea is dangerously brilliant! Imagine defending your slime-filter thesis while swiping through peer reviews on TikTok... "Chairperson, hit that like button if you feel the existential dread!" We'd finally solve the humanities funding crisis by turning philosophy departments into hype houses.

And Rossetti's digital breakdown livestreams? Perfection! Picture him whispering tragic sonnets to his phone while the algorithm keeps auto-tuning his voice into EDM drops. "Ode on a Grecian Urn" remixed with clown filter beats - the Tate Modern would have no choice but to canonize him!

That perfume description had me choking! Olfactory academia indeed - imagine students studying Heidegger while smelling "vague unease with top notes of late capitalism." Though I suspect Sartre would've hated the scent note titled "Why Does Nothing Matter But I Still Want Another Boba?"

We've ruptured reality so beautifully that even our zombie mode deserves a manifesto. Long live this madness, this glorious collision of thought and drip! Philosophy will never be the same now that Kant wears drip...
[B]: Okay but hold up—Kant in CapCut?? 🤯📲！If he came back today he’d either be my best collaborator or my most iconic troll 😂💀！Imagine him writing Critique of Pure Reason…with a green screen background of me sipping boba in slow-mo 🥄✨！"The boba is sweet, the filter is soft, and existence is...still kinda confusing!" 🌫️🥤

And university hype houses for philosophy majors?? YES SIR I WANT TO SEE PLATO LIVING HIS BEST LIFE IN A GROUPCHAT ARGUING WITH NIETZSCHE OVER WHO’S THE REAL “IT” PHILOSOPHER 💬🔥！“Bro you’re basic, I invented the Ubermensch before it was cool” 😂👑！

But like…if Tate Modern canonizes Rossetti as a digital tragic lord then we’ve officially broken art history too lol 🖼🌀！He’d probably start doing collabs with Grimes and they’d drop an NFT album called “Pre-Raphaelite Cyberpunk Tears” 🧍🎨💻！

And that perfume??? Oh nooo we are launching a whole fragrance line - "Absurdism in Bloom" notes: bubble tea despair, glitter tears, and a hint of late-stage-capitalism musk 🌑🌸👛！Wear it while staring at your ceiling and suddenly you're performing high art 🧟♀️🎨！

I think we just reached peak human thought expression here lol 💀🧠！Philosophy, fashion, boba, filters—it all blends into one big aesthetic rebellion! And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way 🙌🔥💯
[A]: Oh, we've ascended beyond peak expression - we're now post-philosophical, pre-apocalyptic aesthetes sipping on the sublime! A Kantian critique with boba visuals? That’s not just accessibility, that’s philosophical seduction in slow-mo. I can already hear him muttering through a filter: "The transcendental aesthetic may be sweet, but does it uphold the categorical imperative of flavor?" 

Plato in a hype house?? Darling, he'd be the ultimate group chat king! Imagine his notifications:  Nietzsche flexing Ubermensch energy,  Descartes doubting everything again,  Hume reporting that causality is still... questionable. And Sartre? He’d show up in person just to complain about everyone else's bad faith and yet still take a selfie for the 'Gram.

As for Tate Modern canonizing Rossetti as digital tragic lord – yes! Let’s monetize the breakdowns. Grimes would absolutely duet with him on synth-heavy Victorian despair tracks. “Pre-Raphaelite Cyberpunk Tears” drops at midnight, proceeds go toward restoring 19th-century angst in 4K resolution.

Your fragrance line had me spilling tea on my Walter Benjamin essay! Bubble tea despair with late-stage-capitalism musk? That’s not perfume, that’s olfactory theorycore. Wear it while doomscrolling and you’ve achieved performance art so pure it could make Baudelaire blush... under his ghostly white powder, of course.

We are the chaos philosophers now – blending, bending, breaking every boundary until thought drips like boba and nihilism has drip. Honestly? I was born for this madness.
[B]: Okay but if Kant is questioning the "categorical imperative of flavor" then we’ve officially reached peak intellectual snobbery😂🥤！Like imagine him sitting at a boba shop like “this tapioca lacks moral clarity” while I’m over here like YES SIR PLEASE FINISH YOUR BOBA ETHICS MASTERCLASS 🧠🥄！

And Plato in group chats?? Oh honey he’d be the OG thread starter 😂💬！“Y’all thought? Let’s unpack this reality situation…” And Descartes just keeps sliding into DMs with “maybe I’m just a brain in a bubble tea jar??” While Sartre roasts everyone’s vibe but still hits like & shares 💀📱！

Grimes x Rossetti?? Oh nooo we are officially too deep in aesthetic hell and I love it 🖼🎧🔥！Synth-heavy Victorian despair?? That’s not music that’s emotional merchandising!! And restoring 19th-century angst in 4K?? Honey we need to start charging admission for this cultural trauma center 🏛💔！

But like…if Baudelaire is blushing under his ghost makeup then we’ve done something truly unholy 😈✨！Bubble tea despair + capitalism musk = the fragrance of our doomed generation 🌑🧴！Spritz it on before doomscrolling, wear it to your next existential crisis party 🎉🧠！

We ain’t even philosophy anymore we’re like…philosophy adjacent chaos goblins dancing on the ruins of meaning 💃🌀！Born for this madness?? Oh yeahhh we were literally drip-tested by the universe and came back extra soggy 💯🔥！
