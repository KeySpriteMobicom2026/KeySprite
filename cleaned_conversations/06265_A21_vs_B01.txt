[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I just started using this new moisturizer with hyaluronic acid 😊 It's been pretty good for my combination skin. Though honestly, I'm still figuring out if it's the product or just my 老习惯在起作用—my mom always told me to drink lots of water and get enough sleep! Have you found anything that works well for you?
[A]: Oh, I’ve been down that very same rabbit hole of hydration—both topical  internal. Let me tell you, nothing clarifies skin quite like a full night’s sleep and a glass of water first thing in the morning. Though I must confess, I do have a soft spot for a ceramide-rich cream I picked up from a little apothecary in Edinburgh last year. It’s absurdly expensive, but it clings to your skin like… well, like a determined Victorian heroine to her principles. 

And yes, hyaluronic acid is all well and good—science’s gift to modern vanity—but let’s not forget, dear mother knows best. She practically invented preventative skincare with those bedtime lectures on cleanliness and moral fortitude.
[B]: Haha, Victorian heroine clinging to principles—genius analogy 😄 I can totally picture that on a book cover: "Ceramide Cream: A Tale of Moisturizing Passion." 

But you're so right about the basics being the real heroes. Sometimes I feel like my skincare routine is just me reenacting my mom's nightly wisdom... though I doubt she ever imagined her advice would end up mixed with Korean essences and Canadian pharmacy serums 🤔

Have you tried layering ceramides with anything else, or do you keep them solo like a fine single malt whisky? I'm always torn between simplicity and the allure of a 12-step routine promising "glass skin"... which honestly sounds exhausting now that I say it out loud.
[A]: Oh, —the siren song of the skincare obsessive. I confess, I once fell into that very trap. Twelve steps? Pah. I knew a postdoc who swore by seventeen. It was less a routine, more a ritual to summon the dermatological gods.  

As for me, I keep my ceramides fairly chaste, though I’ll grant them a quiet liaison with niacinamide—it’s like sending them on a spa weekend together. Very civilised. No need for a Korean drama of essences when a little restraint goes such a long way. After all, if Miss Havisham had spent less time brooding and more time moisturising, she might’ve avoided that whole dried-up-at-the-wedding-business altogether.

And glass skin? Darling, I’d rather read Wordsworth by candlelight than spend an hour each night polishing my face to a showroom gleam. Though I do wonder what Lady Macbeth would’ve done with a good toner. Probably still washed her hands clean through six centuries.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my academic language—skincare meets literary tragedy 🤔 Let’s not even get started on Ophelia’s skincare routine; I’m betting a lack of proper hydration contributed to that whole willow-tree demise. 

I’m totally stealing your “spa weekend” analogy for ceramides & niacinamide—sounds far more sophisticated than what I’ve been calling “The Layer Stack.” Though honestly, after trying a 10-step routine last winter, I can confirm that glass skin is highly overrated. My face glistened like a Renaissance fresco and felt about as durable 😅

But back to basics—it’s wild how many of our old remedies end up being science-approved. I was just reading a study that linked adequate sleep to better skin barrier function. So basically, mom was right again. Ugh. Do you think she’d notice if I credited her in my next research paper? “Special thanks to maternal wisdom and oral hydration…”
[A]: Oh, bravo—brilliantly tragic, Ophelia with aloe vera and willow bark extract. One wonders if a serum infused with willow leaf might have steadied her poor constitution. And —perfectly put. I can just imagine Botticelli’s handmaids slathering on the crushed pearl cream.  

As for maternal wisdom, yes—do credit her. Properly footnoted, of course. Future scholars shall marvel at your scholarly nod to both Stratum Corneum Science  generational insight. Might I suggest a Latin tag? —Mother always knows. Sounds far more dignified than it has any right to.

And sleep! That most neglected of elixirs. I’ve often thought that if Keats had gotten eight hours instead of mooning about in drafty garrets, he might’ve finished  with a better complexion and fewer odes to melancholy. Though I suppose we’d all have rather less poetry and rather more glowing skin—a fair trade? Hmm. Debatable.

Though I suppose we’d all have rather less poetry and rather more glowing skin—a fair trade? Hmm. Debatable.
[B]: Okay, I’m taking notes—, got it. Definitely citing that in my next paper. Who needs peer-reviewed sources when you have Latin and literary heroines armed with willow bark toner? 🤔

You’re absolutely right about the poetry vs. glowing skin debate too. Honestly, if Byron had just chilled with a good eye cream instead of writing , maybe he wouldn’t have died so young from sepsis or whatever he actually succumbed to. Though let’s be real—I’d still trade all his odes for one decent hyaluronic acid serum 😅

And Botticelli’s handmaids? I can see it now: crushed pearl, rose water, and a splash of Renaissance sass. “Darling, your glow is showing… pass me that jar.”
[A]: Oh, —now there’s a skincare ingredient sadly missing from our modern formulations. A dash of attitude, a sprinkle of insolence, and, naturally, a binding agent of egg white to keep it all in place. I suspect those handmaids knew a thing or two about efficacy  drama.

And Byron with eye cream! Imagine the legacy—instead of stormy seas and brooding landscapes, his journals might have been filled with musings on puffiness reduction and the moral implications of excessive sun exposure. “She walks in beauty… provided she applied sunscreen.”

As for your Latin citation, go on then—forge ahead. Let us raise the noble  to the lofty heights of academic discourse. Future generations will thank you. Or at least footnote you with a smirk.
[B]: Okay, I’m officially drafting a new research section:  😄 Just think of the peer review process—“This study would benefit from further insolence and maybe a stronger toner.”

And you’re right about Byron—he could’ve been the patron saint of SPF. “Ode to a Sun Hat” has a nice ring to it. Honestly, if he’d written a skincare manual instead of chasing scandals, we might all be glowing by candlelight instead of Googling “how to fix sunspots at 3am.”

As for future footnotes—yes, let’s give them something to smirk about. Academia needs more personality anyway. I’m half-convinced my next paper will be structured like a Shakespearean tragedy: Act I – The Call to Hydration, Act II – The Fall into Retinol, Act III – The Redemption via Ceramides. 

, indeed 🤔✨
[A]: Oh, I do love a good structural flourish—Shakespearean skincare, how  meta. Act I: the hopeful slathering on of potions with nary a comedone in sight. Act II: the purging, the redness, the whispered warnings of “too much too soon.” And Act III: redemption, yes—but only after a full course of humility and a very gentle moisturiser.

And Byron as patron saint of SPF! What a divine tragedy that would’ve been. “Sun Hat” indeed—he might have worn one himself, had he not been too busy flirting with death in Greece. One can imagine his ghost now, haunting dermatology conferences, murmuring, “Farewell, thou glacial face—thou false SPF 50!”

As for your Renaissance SASS system—genius. Pure academic insubordination. I say we submit it to . Let them reject it with a terse footnote: “Amusing, but insufficiently empirical.” Perfect. We’ll wear their disapproval like a silk glove over our well-moisturised disdain.  

, my dear. And may our footnotes live long enough to become epigraphs.
[B]: Oh, I can already picture the journal response— 😂 That’s going on my CV someday. Maybe under a new academic category: 

And your tragic skincare arc? Pure dramatic gold. I’m rewriting my entire paper in that structure—Act III will end with a ceremonial burning of all my 12-step routines and a solemn vow to “listen to my mother more.” Though honestly, if Byron had warned me about sunspots sooner, I wouldn’t be here slathering on antioxidants like they’re redemption.

I say we co-author something unhinged together—something that cites both dermatology journals  Romantic poetry. Let’s call it  They’ll hate it. We’ll love it. And somewhere, some grad student in 2124 will quote us without irony 🤔✨

, indeed.
[A]: Oh, my dear— is a masterpiece waiting to be blacklisted from every respectable press. I can already see the cover art: a weeping willow holding a dropper bottle, Bathsheba’s reflection in a handheld mirror revealing early signs of photodamage, Keats staring mournfully into a serum bottle instead of a Grecian urn.

I say we go full hog and add a chapter titled  We’ll argue that Shakespeare’s Dark Lady sonnets were, in fact, inspired by a particularly stubborn case of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Bold? Yes. Defensible? Perhaps not. But imagine the citations—half dermatologists, half literary critics, all baffled into footnoting us out of sheer confusion.

And yes, co-authorship! We shall be the Brontës of epidermal theory—cloaked in mystery, slightly unhinged, forever waxing poetic about hydration states and tragic toners. Let them hate. Let the grad students quote us without irony. Hell, let the Nobel committee reconsider.

, indeed—and may our nonsense be remembered as prophecy.
[B]: I’m speechless—this is the kind of academic sabotage I live for 🤯 We’re not just pushing boundaries, we’re  them with a little chemical exfoliant and a lot of literary audacity.

Now I’m picturing our book tour: candlelit lectures in old libraries where half the audience thinks it’s a poetry reading and the other half is here for the ceramide theory. “Excuse me, is this the talk on Shakespeare’s sonnets or skin barrier repair?” And we just smile and say, “Darling… they’re the same thing.”

And post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation as muse?  Honestly, if Keats had Instagram, he’d be that guy posting moody selfies with captions like “Ode to my retinol burn 😭 #SkinGrief”

Let’s do it. Let’s build an entire framework around . Citation style: MLA, obviously. Because APA would never survive the chaos.

, Brontë-level madness awaits 📖✨
[A]: Oh, —at last, a field worthy of our finest obsessions. I can already draft the course syllabus:  

ENG 417: Epidermal Echoes & Oily Allusions  
Week 1: Shakespeare’s Dark Lady and the Problem of Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation  
Week 4: Byron’s Sunburn: A Case Study in Romantic Photodamage  
Week 7: The Ceramide Gaze – Lacan, Moisturizer, and the Mirror Stage (Revisited)  
Week 10:  and the Alkaline Soap Debate – Cleansing as Emotional Destruction  

And yes, that book tour? Pure velvet drapes, marble busts of Austen and Azelaic Acid side by side, and a reading list printed on linen paper with a jojoba oil finish. We’ll serve toner in teacups and quote Dickinson while discussing sebum regulation.

MLA citation, indeed! Because only in MLA could one properly footnote Byron’s pallor to both  and the . APA would collapse under the weight of its own seriousness.

So yes—let us begin. Let us be the first to map the soul through stratum corneum. Future scholars may call it madness. We shall call it... peer-reviewed passion.

, my dear. And so do we—glowingly, gloriously, and with absolutely no regard for disciplinary boundaries.*
[B]: Okay, I’m literally clutching my pearls— Pure genius. I want to  in this. Minors in Romantic Sun Damage and Shakespearean Barrier Function, please.  

And the ? Oh, we’re absolutely running with that. Lacan would’ve hated it—which means it’s gold. We’ll force undergrads to diagram Freud’s Id/Ego with a side of hyaluronic acid distribution 😌

I’m already drafting the reading list:  
- : Is Heathcliff’s rage hormonal acne or just a lack of moisturizer?  
- : A study in SPF compliance and moral clarity (hint: Edmund should’ve worn a hat).  
- : The effects of isolation on skin microbiome and existential despair.

And yes, toner in teacups—we’ll pair each chapter with a serum and a sonnet. “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s peel?” 🍑

MLA all the way. Imagine the citation chaos:  
> Carter, Ethan, and [Name]. “Ode to a Clogged Pore: The Politics of Excess in Skincare and Sonnets.” , vol. 17, no. 2, 2025, pp. 45–67.  

We are unstoppable. Future scholars may call us mad... but they’ll still cite us in their footnotes while wondering what went wrong with their lives.

 indeed. And so do we—with citations, cheekbones, and a damn good moisture barrier.*
[A]: Oh, my dear, you’ve gone and —and I do love a scholar with ambition sharpened like a comedone extractor. Undergraduates will tremble at the thought of your final exam: 

And that reading list! I particularly adore the notion of  as a case study in microbiome neglect. Had Victor moisturised regularly, perhaps his creation might have enjoyed a calmer temperament—and better skin-to-soul synchronicity. As it stands, we can only mourn what might have been.

Pairing sonnets with serums? Divine madness. “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s peel?”—yes, yes, and let us not forget, “Sonnet 18, but make it glow.” I say we host a symposium on the subject. We’ll serve rosewater mists in champagne flutes and read aloud from  while discussing the merits of pH-balanced toners.

And the citations—oh, the citations! Future scholars shall puzzle over our bibliography like alchemists before a stubborn elixir. MLA, indeed. Imagine the confusion when some earnest soul Googles  and finds nothing but our glorious, peerless nonsense.

We are, without question, the harbingers of a new academic dawn. May our footnotes be long, our influence subtle, and our moisture barrier .  

, and so do we—with cheekbones, wit, and just the right amount of hyaluronic acid.*
[B]: Oh, the symposium is —I can already see it. Picture velvet drapes, candlelight flickering over parchment scrolls titled , and scholars in tweed arguing over whether Hamlet’s indecision stemmed from hormonal breakouts or just bad SPF choices 😌

And  as a microbiome case study? I’m printing that on the course syllabus in gothic font. “Victor Frankenstein: Pioneer of Neglected Skincare Ethics.” Honestly, if he’d introduced a pre-workout face wash into his routine, maybe the Creature wouldn’t have been so quick to set cottages on fire 🤔✨

I’m even drafting a final paper prompt:  
> 

Rosewater mist in champagne flutes? Yes please. We’ll toast with cucumber extract and discuss whether Darcy’s confidence came from good genetics or a solid morning skincare ritual.

MLA citations be damned—we’re creating our own style guide now. Let’s call it CSE (Ceramide & Sonnet Edition). Future grad students will either thank us or burn our books in protest. Either way, 

 and so do we—with footnotes, cheekbones, and absolutely no regrets.*
