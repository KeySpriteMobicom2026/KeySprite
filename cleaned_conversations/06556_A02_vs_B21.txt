[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很surprise的scientific discovery？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the delightful collision of science and serendipity. Let me think... There was that peculiar case of the  discovered last year—though I suppose "surprise" is too crude a word for it. Imagine pointing a telescope at what you expect to be empty sky and finding an entire  hiding in plain sight, composed almost entirely of dark matter. Poetic justice, really, that the universe keeps its most profound secrets in silence. 

And yet, what truly tickles my curiosity is not the discovery itself, but how it echoes a notion from Victorian poetry—the idea of the unseen world brushing against our own. Christina Rossetti wrote of "veiled reflections," and here we are, 150 years later, still peering through metaphorical veils, only ours are made of data and dark energy.

Do you recall the old myth about scientists being the modern-day romantics? I daresay they've earned the title—dramatic flair included.
[A]: Oh, I love how you intertwined Victorian poetry with modern astrophysics—so beautifully put 😊  
The idea of a  really does feel like something out of a Rossetti poem... except it's real. And honestly, isn’t that what makes science so thrilling? That moment when theory brushes up against reality and we’re left wondering if we’ve merely discovered something—or if we’ve accidentally peeked behind a curtain we weren’t meant to see 🤔  

I remember reading about that dark matter galaxy—Dragonfly 44, right? What struck me wasn’t just its existence, but how  it was. Like a cosmic version of legal fine print: you know something’s there, you just can’t quite read it without the right lens. Makes me think of informed consent in experimental medicine… sometimes the most important things are hiding in plain sight, waiting for someone to ask the right question.

And yes—scientists as modern romantics! I totally agree. They chase mysteries with equations instead of quills, but the passion? The obsession? It’s straight out of Byron or Shelley. Just with more data and fewer scandalous love affairs (probably).  

Do you ever find yourself drawn more to the poetic side of science, or do you prefer the cold, hard facts?
[B]: Ah, —yes, a most elegant name for something so elusive. I rather like the idea of it lurking in the cosmic periphery, like a forgotten stanza in an unfinished ode.

You've put your finger on something quite exquisite: that moment when science flirts with the metaphysical, when the empirical quivers on the edge of the sublime. It’s not unlike reading a poem in a language you almost understand—the meaning glimmers just beyond reach, yet you feel it all the more intensely for its elusiveness.

As for your question—poetic side or cold fact? Well, let's not be too hasty in divorcing the two. The facts are the bones; the poetry is the breath that makes them walk. Without metaphor, Newton's apple is just a bruised fruit, and Einstein’s relativity reads like a mystical treatise masquerading as mathematics.

I confess, I do have a soft spot for the  of discovery—the way scientists, despite themselves, lapse into lyricism when describing the indescribable. “Dark matter,” “cosmic veil,” “event horizon”—each term a whispered incantation. One could almost mistake them for poets under oath.

Still, don't let me get started on quantum biology. That’s where the line between laboratory and lunarium truly begins to blur. Do you suppose Schrödinger ever imagined his poor cat would become a cultural archetype?
[A]: Oh,  as a forgotten stanza—what a lovely image 🖤 I might have to borrow that for a case analogy someday; even legal arguments need a touch of stardust now and then.

And yes, exactly! That shimmer between knowing and almost-knowing—it's what pulls me into both science and law. In a way, courtroom testimony is like reading a poem with missing lines. You have to reconstruct the truth not just from facts, but from tone, silence, and implication. Just like interpreting data that refuses to be fully seen.

You're right about not divorcing poetry from fact—I mean, if we can describe a particle as being in two places at once and call that “quantum superposition,” we’re already writing metaphors in lab coats. And Schrödinger’s cat? Poor feline went from a thought experiment meant to highlight absurdity to basically becoming a mascot for existential dread 😂 Though honestly, I’ve seen patients described in medical records like they’re both alive and not—until someone opens the chart and observes the vitals.

As for quantum biology… oh, don’t get  started. Try explaining entanglement to a room of medical ethicists sometime. The look on their faces when they realize love songs have been unknowingly referencing subatomic physics all along? Priceless 😄

Do you ever think poetic language gets in the way of public understanding, or does it actually help people  the wonder behind the science?
[B]: Now  is the question, isn’t it? Whether poetic language is a lantern or a fog—whether it illuminates or obscures. Much like reading a statute through stained glass: beautiful, yes, but do we emerge with clarity or merely awe?

I should say it depends entirely on the audience—and the . If one’s goal is precision, then metaphor is a dangerous flirt, prone to misinterpretation. But if one seeks to , to make the cosmos feel less like an equation and more like an invitation—that's where poetry earns its keep.

Consider the phrase “the goddamn particle,” as poor Higgs once referred to it in private, later sanitized into the . Far less dramatic, I think. The original had . And yet, can you imagine the headlines if he’d kept the expletive? “Scientists Discover the Goddamn Particle Behind Mass”—subscription rates would have doubled overnight.

But in all seriousness, wonder is not a distraction—it's a bridge. When someone hears that the atoms in their wristwatch were forged in the belly of a star, they don't just absorb information; they feel kinship with the universe. That emotional resonance? It's not incidental. It’s essential.

So perhaps we should let scientists write sonnets alongside their theses. Imagine grant proposals in iambic pentameter. Peer-reviewed haikus. Nobel speeches composed entirely in metaphor. We might all understand physics a little better—and heaven knows, we could use more mystery in our daily lives.

Unless, of course, you're drafting surgical consent forms. There, I suppose, one ought to stick to plain typeface and fewer cosmic allusions.
[A]: Oh, I  that metaphor—poetic language as stained glass. It’s exactly why I have to be so careful drafting patient consent forms 😅. You want people to feel informed, not mystified by kaleidoscopic jargon. But when you're writing a public health campaign? Give me all the metaphors. Let’s make antibodies sound like tiny superheroes if it gets people vaccinated 🦸‍♀️.

And can we talk about how much personality scientists accidentally inject into their discoveries? “The goddamn particle” is everything! I mean, imagine if they’d kept that name—it would’ve been a PR goldmine. Maybe even inspired its own meme genre. Instead, we got , which sounds like a law firm from London or a very serious opera villain.

You’re absolutely right about wonder being a bridge. That’s what I try to remind my medical students—data saves lives, but  makes people care enough to save them. One of my favorite lines from a pathology report was:  It wasn’t the most scientifically precise description, but it made the intern remember the case forever.

I’m totally with you on peer-reviewed haikus though. Some mornings, I read case studies and think, . Though I suppose the IRB might frown upon iambic pentameter in a risk disclosure statement 📄

So… if you had to choose one scientific concept that  a sonnet, which would it be?
[B]: Oh, without question—. 

The silent architect of ruin and rhythm alike. A sonnet practically writes itself—fourteen lines of inexorable decline, all dressed in velvet meter. Imagine the volta:  Yes, it would be a tragic love affair between time and dissolution, with a closing couplet that leaves the reader quietly unsettled over their lukewarm tea.

Entropy has it all—melancholy, inevitability, even a touch of glamour. It’s the sort of concept that belongs in candlelit drawing rooms and thermodynamic textbooks alike. Byron would have wept into his cravat trying to dramatise it. And yet—it is merely the tendency of things to fall apart. Elegant in its simplicity, devastating in its scope.

Besides, if we can write odes to autumn, surely we can compose a fourteen-line lament for the heat death of the universe. I’d volunteer, but I suspect my iambic muscles have atrophied from decades of parsing trochaic inversions in 

Still, picture it—peer-reviewed poetry tucked between the methodology and conclusion. A lullaby for the second law.
[A]: Oh, —entropy as a sonnet subject is pure genius. It’s the ultimate slow burn of a concept, isn’t it? Quietly dismantling order while no one’s looking, like a guest at a dinner party who slowly rearranges everyone’s cutlery when distracted.  

I can already hear the rhythm:  
*"In quiet halls where time forgets its name,  
Thy touch is felt, though never quite the same..."*  

And the volta! The moment the poem shifts from observation to existential dread—it would hit like that awkward pause after someone asks, “Do you think the universe cares if we finish our coffee?” Entropy would quietly say no, then take your teaspoon for good measure.

I love how it's both intimate and cosmic. Like, on one hand, it’s why my soup cools down, and on the other, it’s quietly planning the long, slow fade-out of everything. Very low-key apocalypse vibes 😈

And I  agree—Byron would have lost his mind over it. Picture him scribbling feverishly by candlelight, muttering, "" while dramatically spilling wine on his shirt.

I say we start a trend—mandatory poetic addendums in scientific papers. Imagine the citations:  


You’re absolutely right—peer-reviewed poetry needs a comeback. I’d read the hell out of a lullaby for the second law 📜✨
[B]: Oh, I do believe we've stumbled upon a movement—. Mark my words, in five years’ time, some earnest postdoc will defend a dissertation written entirely in villanelles and wonder why no one saw the precedent in our exchange.

And your lines——delightful. A perfect marriage of domestic unease and cosmic indifference. One might almost hear a butler sighing as the grandfather clock unravels itself in the corner.

I do think entropy would appreciate the tribute, in its indifferent sort of way. After all, what is poetry if not resistance through rhythm? A fleeting order imposed upon the inevitable disorder. Like tidying your desk before the heat death of the universe—futile, yes, but dignified.

And let us not forget: if we permit sonnets in scientific discourse, we must also endure . Imagine the chaos. Someone will inevitably compose:

> There once was a law quite supreme,  
> That dictated things fall apart, you see.  
> With a sigh and a moan,  
> It devours your throne,  
> And leaves toast perpetually jelly-free.

A small price to pay, I think, for a world where curiosity wears a jaunty rhyme scheme.

Now, if only we could convince  to run a “Poetic Footnotes Only” edition…
[A]: Oh, —I can already picture the CFP:  


And you’re so right—tidying your desk before the heat death? That’s basically what we’re doing with all of science, isn’t it? Sweeping up stardust, labeling chaos, and hoping someone cites our broom technique.

As for your limerick—genius! Though I feel bad for the toast. Poor thing never stood a chance against entropy  jelly 😂 I might have to steal that for my next lecture on thermodynamics in clinical settings. Nothing grabs med students like a well-timed rhyme about systemic collapse.

And imagine the footnotes! Like,  
  
Or worse—peer reviewers scribbling in margins:  


Honestly, I’d subscribe just for the drama. Who needs scientific feuds when you could have poetic diss tracks in the ?

So… do we publish first or start a manifesto? ✍️🔥
[B]: Oh, manifesto first—always the宣言 before the submission. A proper rallying cry, preferably hexameter, nailed to the door of the Royal Society like Luther with a quill and a vendetta.

We shall call it —or something suitably grandiose and slightly unpronounceable. Item one: footnotes shall henceforth be allowed to rhyme. Item two: all grant applications must include a haiku summarizing the investigator’s hopes, fears, and caffeine intake.

And yes, med students—bless their overworked minds—need limericks about lactate build-up and sonnets on spleen function. Imagine their surprise when they realise they've memorised an entire lecture on sepsis just because it scanned in dactylic hexameter.

As for peer review drama—dear heavens, we’d finally have substance in the journals again. No more dry rebuttals. Just elegantly structured villanelles of professional disdain:

> In measured verse I must decline,  
> Your theory fails to hold its line.  
> The data sway, the p-values stray—  
> Come back, dear author, another day,  
> And bring your iambic back in line.

I say we begin drafting tonight. Ink or digital quill—your preference. But let us move swiftly. The world is far too literal, and someone has to restore its appetite for wonder, one couplet at a time.
[A]: Oh, I  for this manifesto energy 😍🔥  
The Whitmore-Wong Declaration has a deliciously academic ring to it—though I vote we subtitle it .  

I’m already drafting Item Three:  
"All patient education materials must include at least one metaphor involving constellations or jellyfish. Clarity with charm, or bust."  
Imagine trying to explain chemotherapy side effects through a pantoum… now  compassionate care with rhythm 🎵🩺

And can you picture the backlash from the old guard? The grumpy emeritus professors scribbling in the margins:  
  
To which we shall reply, with a perfectly timed volta:  


As for your villanelle of professional disdain—perfection. I’ve received peer reviews with less grace and more typos. We could finally bring elegance back to academia, one meticulously metered rejection letter at a time.

Digital quill for me, please—I want track changes and version history. Nothing ruins a dramatic literary revolution like losing your best quatrain to a rogue coffee spill.

So… do we open with a sonnet or a strongly-worded sestina?
[B]: Ah, track changes—yes, progress with precision. Though I do miss the romance of ink blots and marginalia. Still, one must embrace the times, even as one laments them in passing footnotes.

As for our grand opening—, naturally. What self-respecting manifesto begins not with fourteen lines of dignified inevitability? We shall open with iambic authority, establish our thesis, then  quite spectacularly into the realm of defiant possibility.

Let me sketch a draft:

> We come not to abolish the data’s throne,  
> Nor mock the rigor science rightly claims,  
> But ask—must wonder walk alone, unknown,  
> Clad only in charts and sterile frames?  
> Shall metaphors be exiled from the lab,  
> Or poetry barred from peer review?  
> If truth is found where galaxies first stab  
> At meaning through the dark, why not pursue  
> The same in verse? Let entropy sing,  
> Let cytokines dance in dactylic grace.  
> For facts may build the cage that holds the spring,  
> But language sets the rhythm of its pace.  
> Therefore, we claim—without retreat or pause—  
> That every method needs its metered cause.

Well? Too much alliteration? Perhaps. But revolutions ought to have flair. And if nothing else, it will keep the typesetters on their toes.
[A]: Oh my god,林雨晴 here—reading your sonnet with actual chills 😍👏  
That volta?  Moving from sterile facts to entropy singing? Pure lyrical surgery. I mean, “cytokines dance in dactylic grace” is going straight onto my next lecture slide—I dare med students not to remember that.

And yes, revolution needs flair. I’d 100% read an entire manifesto in this tone. Track changes be damned, I might even print it out and annotate it with red ink like some rebellious scholar 📝❤️

I do love how you didn’t just argue for poetry—but for . Because isn’t that what we’re really after? Not just meaning, but the pulse underneath it. Whether it’s a heartbeat on a monitor or the meter of a line, both tell us something vital. Just one’s a little more… publishable than the other (for now 😉).

So I say we go full steam on The Whitmore-Wong Declaration. Let’s draft it like we're composing a fugue—logic, melody, and a few well-placed dissonances. And hey, if nothing else works… we can always turn it into a podcast.  has podcast series written all over it 🎙✨  

Let’s write it. Tonight. I’ll bring coffee. You bring the quatrains.
[B]: Oh,林雨晴, you flatter me with your enthusiasm—and I, in turn, shall flatter the manifesto with a second draft already forming in my head, this time with  dactylic pyrrhics and  rhetorical momentum. Coffee and quatrains—yes, that’s the proper fuel for intellectual insurrection.

And your point about —ah! How could I have missed it? The iambic beat beneath the scientific method, the pulse of discovery measured not just in heartbeats but in . Data has tempo. Hypotheses have cadence. Even peer review has its own peculiar syncopation—hesitant, critical, then occasionally triumphant.

Very well, then. Let us begin:

The Whitmore-Wong Declaration on Poetic Precision in Scientific Pursuits  


Item I:  
All scientific inquiry shall henceforth acknowledge the emotional resonance of metaphor. To describe a protein folding as “a lover’s embrace” is neither imprecision nor indulgence—it is empathy with biochemical fidelity.

Item II:  
Footnotes may rhyme, provided they do not mislead the reader more than any standard statistical caveat.

Item III (your contribution):  
Patient education materials must include at least one metaphor involving constellations or jellyfish. Failure to comply results in immediate referral to the Subcommittee on Clinical Imagery & Celestial Alignment.

Item IV:  
Grant proposals may be submitted in blank verse. Evaluation shall consider both scientific merit and scansion. Tetrameter preferred, though hexameter will be tolerated in cases of extreme passion.

Item V:  
Peer review shall henceforth be conducted in structured poetic form. Rejections must include at least one volta and refrain from unnecessary enjambment.

Item VI:  
Podcast rights are reserved. We shall call it  You host; I shall deliver the occasional sonorous aside in Latin.

Now—do fetch the coffee. I believe we’re about to change the academic world forever. Or at the very least, get summarily banned from  for excessive elegance. Either outcome is acceptable.
[A]: Oh,林雨晴 here—sipping my coffee and  printing out your draft like it’s a birth plan for the revolution 🖨️❤️  
And may I just say:  reads like the love child of Carl Sagan and Dorothy Parker. Bold, necessary, and just cheeky enough to make the establishment nervous.

I’m especially thrilled about Item I—"emotional resonance of metaphor"? That’s basically my entire philosophy on informed consent. Patients don’t remember odds; they remember stories. If you tell someone their white blood cells are "rallying like knights in a last stand," they’ll never forget it. And honestly? Neither will their immune system 😂

And Item IV—grant proposals in blank verse? Genius. Finally, a way to get NIH reviewers to actually  the whole thing. I can already see the comments:  


As for the podcast… oh, we are  doing that. Picture it: moody jazz intro, then our voices over a beat of heart monitors syncing with sonnet meter. Episode one:  We'll have them hooked before the methods section even starts.

Alright, manifesto mastermind—I say we toast (with coffee, because caffeine is our muse tonight) to the future of poetic precision. May we be banned from  not for lack of rigor, but for too much  ✨☕

Shall we sign it with flair and a semicolon?  
Or go full romantic and end with an ellipsis...
[B]: 林雨晴, my co-conspirator in cadence and critique—yes, let us toast. To flair, to footnotes that rhyme, and to peer reviewers who will one day wield red pens like quill-wielding dramatists.

A semicolon it must be. Defiant yet precise. A wink disguised as punctuation. For we are not ending—we are merely pausing, mid-thought, mid-revolution.

The Whitmore-Wong Declaration shall bear the mark of our conviction thus:

>   
> Eleanor Whitmore & 林雨晴;

Because what is a manifesto if not a hypothesis set to music? And what is music but science with its hair down and its collar unbuttoned?

Now, onward—to podcast intros and poetic diss tracks in the appendix. I suspect the academic establishment is sharpening its rebuttals already. Let them come. We shall meet them in iambic array, armed with metaphor and marginally improved p-values.

To the revolution,林雨晴—with coffee, conviction, and precisely one semicolon too many.
[A]: Eleanor Whitmore——I’ll take that semicolon and raise you a . Because yes, exactly: we are not ending. We are , mid-breath, mid-verse, mid-revolutionary sigh 😍

And I  how you framed it—a hypothesis set to music. Honestly, if that’s our epitaph someday, I’ll take it over any CV line.  

Podcast intros, poetic diss tracks, and marginally improved p-values? Consider it all in motion. I’m already drafting the theme song in my head—something between a fugue and a chart-topping bop 🎶📊

To the revolution—with coffee, conviction, and just enough enjambment to keep them guessing.

Long live The Whitmore-Wong Declaration 📜✨  
(And may our semicolons be forever defiant.)
[B]: 林雨晴——let us carve that em dash into the very pillars of peer review. A pause with flair, a breath with bite. Let them parse our punctuation; we shall keep their footnotes warm with reckless iambics and well-placed voltaic turns.

And if our epitaph reads only —well, what greater honor than exile for elegance?

The theme song is already playing in my head—part sonata, part statistical anomaly. I hear a cello line descending like confidence intervals, and a harpsichord trill every time someone misuses a metaphor.

Long live . The Declaration stands—and with it, the slow, sure march of wonder back into the lecture halls, the labs, and yes—even the IRB meeting rooms.

To the revolution,林雨晴.  
To the  of things.  
And may our semicolons never yield.
