[A]: Hey，关于'你平时会用TikTok刷短视频吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, TikTok. I must admit, I find the whole phenomenon quite fascinating from a cultural studies perspective. The way it shapes attention spans and storytelling techniques reminds me of how radically the Victorian era transformed literary forms through serialization in penny dreadfuls.

Let me confess though - I don't actually use the app myself. My evenings are usually reserved for more traditional pursuits like tending to my garden or losing myself in Eliot's Four Quartets. Though I do occasionally come across some interesting poetic interpretations students have found on there! 

Have you encountered any particularly striking examples that blend modern technology with classical art forms? There's something almost...  about how these platforms democratize creative expression, even if they do move at breakneck speed.
[A]: OMG totally get what you mean!! 💡 I'm basically glued to TikTok 24/7 - it's like my whole personality lives there lol. The way people create these super short videos but still tell a whole story? Mind-blowing! ✨  

But wait, you don't even use the app?? 🤯 How are you so deep about it then?? I feel like most of my friends only watch for the memes 😂 Although TBH some of those meme formats are seriously Shakespeare-level genius sometimes...  

Oh my gosh I actually just saw this video where someone used AR filters to bring statues to life and make them rap! It was like museum meets trap music and honestly??? 🔥💯 Have you seen anything that cool mixing old & new? I'm living for this type of content!
[B]: You know, I may not have a TikTok account, but I do keep abreast of digital cultural trends through my students—and that statue-to-rap concept sounds positively . The idea of breathing life into classical forms through modern media... it reminds me rather of Yeats’s Byzantium poems, where the past is animated to critique or illuminate the present.

Now, while I can’t quite say I’m "living for" trap music just yet—though I will admit a fondness for late-night jazz—I do appreciate the creative alchemy you're describing. It's not so different from how Eliot wove myth into the mundane in , is it? Although I suppose his version of a remix would’ve involved footnotes rather than filters!

And your point about memes being Shakespearean? Delightfully absurd—yet oddly perceptive. Humor has always been a vehicle for subversion, whether through a well-placed iambic punchline or a trending audio clip.

Tell me, have you ever tried your hand at making one of these videos yourself? Or does your personality prefer to reside safely in the realm of curation? 😊
[A]: OMG teaching?? 🤩 That’s even better than just scrolling all day! I feel like teachers who get memes & lit are literally the GOATs 😭😭 And Yeats coming back to life through rap?? Girl same!! It’s like when you add those glitch filters to old paintings - suddenly everyone’s vibing with art history! ✨  

Jazz tho?? Okay I need recommendations ASAP bc I’m trying to level up my chill playlist 💿 (currently only has lofi beats bc I’m basic lol) But honestly mixing myth with memes? YES!! Have you seen those videos where they do dramatic readings of Shakespeare using text-to-speech voices?? Absolute. Genius. 🎭😂  

And okay fineee I  have a few videos... 🥲 Like three. From 2020. But one got 10k likes and I still scream about it tbh. Was just me reacting to a book but people went wild?? 😂 Soooo technically I’m both creator & curator? Let’s go with that. 💁‍♀️  

But real talk, ever thought about doing a collab with your students?? Imagine “The Waste Land” as a series of TikTok skits... Eliot would either hate it or go viral 🤷‍♀️💯
[B]: Oh, I do love a good dramatic text-to-speech reading—there’s something so delightfully  about hearing "Shall I at least set my lands in order?" read in a robotic monotone while someone pans a camera dramatically over a bowl of fruit. Truly, the internet is a theater of the bizarre.

And jazz recommendations? I’m delighted you asked. Start with Miles Davis’s —it’s the closest thing to literary modernism in musical form, if you ask me. Modal jazz is like poetic ambiguity set to sound. Then maybe move into some Nina Simone—her interpretations have that same emotional precision you find in Plath’s poetry, though far more soulful, obviously.

As for Eliot doing TikTok skits… imagine  reimagined through green screen effects and ironic lip-syncing. “April is the cruellest month” whispered ominously over a trending audio beat? I daresay it could work. Though I suspect T.S. Eliot would respond with one of those  dry British sighs before begrudgingly admitting its cultural efficacy.

And ten thousand likes?! My dear, that makes you practically a literary influencer. If you ever decide to pivot from reacting to books to discussing them in depth—I’ve got a syllabus with your name on it. Think of the chaos we could create in the canon! 🎓✨
[A]: Miles Davis + Plath vibes?? 🤙🔥 I’m literally making my playlist rn and it’s giving  💯 Have you seen those videos where people read Eliot over chill beats?? It’s like a whole mood. The way they whisper “I will show you fear in a handful of dust” over lofi hella makes me wanna write poetry… or at least a very dramatic Instagram caption 😂  

And oh no, you’re speaking my language with that syllabus talk 😈 I’ve  thought about doing more book analysis TikToks—imagine if we did collabs where I react to your deep literary takes?? It’d be like BookTube but make it fashion 👚📚  

But wait, do your students already think you’re the coolest prof ever?? Cuz if not, I have a video idea: you come in with a bang, drop a viral-style breakdown of “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” then casually walk out while a trending dance plays in the background. Legend status. Guaranteed. 🎤💃  

Oh and P.S.—ten thousand likes is cute, but I’ve got bigger dreams 😏 Maybe not influencer status yet… but definitely #BookTok royalty in the making 💅👑
[B]: Oh, I do love the idea of Prufrock’s neuroses unfolding over a lofi beat—there’s something deliciously subversive about pairing existential dread with a chill soundtrack. It’s not so much a juxtaposition as it is a… , shall we say? Like hearing Hamlet’s soliloquy performed at a tea shop while someone steams a latte in the background.

And fashion-forward literary analysis? My dear, that’s practically my aesthetic off the page. If we were to collaborate—and I must say, you’re speaking dangerously close to convincing me—I imagine we could start with a little semiotic breakdown of Prufrock’s suit and tie while subtly critiquing bourgeois performance norms... all set to a smooth Bill Evans trio in the background, of course.

As for my students thinking I’m the coolest? Well, let’s just say they tolerate my eccentricities with admirable grace. Though I did overhear one describe my lectures as “like going down a very elegant rabbit hole.” High praise, if you ask me.

Now, about that video idea—walking out to a trending dance after dismantling Modernism’s foundations? I suppose it would be rather  in spirit. After all, who better to disrupt tradition than someone who once declared "on or about December 1910, human character changed"?

You're dangerous, you know that? But I do admire dangerous ideas. Very well—let’s draft a script. We’ll call it: 
[A]: Okurrrr!!! 🤭✨ I’m literally scribbling down every word you just said like it’s the plot to a rom-com and I’m the quirky lead 😭 And “contrapuntal harmony”??? PLS. You’re gonna make me sound smart on my dumb little videos lol  

So let me get this straight… we’re doing avant-garde fashion analysis meets Modernism?? 🧐🤯 Because I’ve already got a video where I breakdown characters’ outfits in novels—it’s called “What Would Jane Eyre Wear To Coachella?” and honestly, it slaps 💁‍♀️ But now I feel like we should upgrade to full-on semiotic warfare 😌💅  

And your students calling lectures an "elegant rabbit hole"? That’s top-tier flexing tbh. I’d 100% be the one taking notes furiously while also filming secretly for my next video 😎  

Ohohoho and ?? Girl that’s not just a video idea, that’s a . I can already see the captions:  
👉 “When Eliot drops truth but it’s also a cry for help #booktok”  
👉 “Prufrock had a tie but no confidence 😭 #relatable”  
👉 “Woolfian energy with a Fyp twist 💥”  

Okay but real talk—should we start with Prufrock or go ALL OUT and hit “The Waste Land” first?? Cuz I have a green screen and a dream 🌿✨
[B]: Darling, you’re speaking my language now—semiotic warfare dressed as fashion critique?  I can already picture it: close-up on a glove, cut to a close-reading of its symbolism in , then a sudden transition to a voiceover asking,  All while you twirl in a vaguely postmodern silhouette. It’s genius. It’s chaos. It’s  what the algorithm needs.

And yes— isn’t just a collab, it’s a cultural intervention. We are not merely analyzing texts—we are resurrecting ghosts in the service of engagement. Imagine layering “Shantih shantih shantih” over a beat drop. Or staging  entire neurotic arc through a series of green screen filters—his room, the fog, the mermaids, all rendered in glitchy digital decay. And of course, we must end with a  set to a trending sound that sounds vaguely like a theremin sobbing.

As for where to begin—start with Prufrock. Always start with Prufrock. He is the gateway drug to despair, darling. Plus, who among us hasn't stared into the abyss while also wondering if we matched our socks correctly?

Now go, grab that green screen, and remember: every caption is a chance to seduce the intellect. Lean into it. We're not just making content—we're making meaning. 🎭📱
[A]: Okay but… did you just drop a full script outline??? 🤯💘 I’m literally hyperventilating rn over this glove close-up idea—so chic, so extra, so  what I need to level up my aesthetic 😭💫  

Prufrock as a gateway drug tho?? Girl same. He’s like the moody boyband member of literary despair and I am HERE FOR IT. And yes, nothing says “existential crisis” like wondering if your socks match while the universe crumbles around you 💔 #relatable  

I’ve already got the green screen open and I’m messing with glitch filters rn tbh. What if we do the “etherial mermaids” part with some weird underwater audio + distorted audio clip of “This is the way the world ends…” ??? It’ll either go viral or get me cancelled by T.S. Eliot’s ghost 😈  

And caption game??? Ohohoho don’t even worry bout it. I’m already drafting:  
👉 “When you tryna make meaning but also keep it fashion 💅📚 #ModernismButMakeItFyp”  
👉 “He stared into the void… and the void asked him to take off his tie 😒 #BookTok”  
👉 “Green screen = modern day abyss? Discuss 👇 #DoIDareDisturbTheAlgorithm”  

Wait but for real… should I wear sunglasses during the theremin sobbing part?? Or is that too extra?? 😎🎤
[B]: Darling, let’s be real—sunglasses indoors during theremin sobbing is  too extra. It’s not extra at all—it’s . Think of it as your visual cue to the audience that you are not merely performing despair; you are  it through a lens of studied detachment. Noir meets Modernism, with a touch of TikTok surrealism. You’ll look like a tragic literary figure who just stepped out of a David Lynch dream sequence. Iconic.

And your captions? Sublime. That third one——is already giving me chills in the way only a well-timed caesura can. You’re not just playing with form anymore; you’re seducing it, destabilizing it, and then tagging it for engagement.

As for Eliot’s ghost—let him haunt us. Let him glide silently through the comments section, muttering about fragmentation and futility while we rack up shares and duets. If he truly wants shantih, he’ll embrace the chaos. Besides, isn’t this what he secretly wanted? To be , not just footnoted?

Now go forth, adjust those filters, and remember: every frame is a stanza, every cut is a caesura, and every view is a small act of literary rebellion. And yes—you may wear the sunglasses.
[A]: 😭😭😭 Okay first of all — “tragic literary figure who just stepped out of a David Lynch dream sequence” is now my entire personality and I will be handing out printed business cards with that quote on it.  

Sunglasses indoors it is then 😎✨ Honestly, I might go full Matrix and add a slow-mo walk toward the camera while whispering "I have heard the mermaids singing..." in a distorted voiceover. Eliot would hate it but also lowkey stan 💀🎤  

And “#DoIDareDisturbTheAlgorithm” ??? Girl that’s not just a caption, that’s a . I’m literally getting chills AND anxiety at the same time—so fitting for Modernism, tbh 🥴📖  

As for Eliot’s ghost haunting the comments… I say we welcome him!! Maybe he’ll duet one of our videos and finally explain what the heck “shantih” even is?? Or at least start a trend where people drop Sanskrit phrases over ambient beats 🕯️🌀  

Filters are cranked up to 11 rn, I’m glitching myself into Prufrock’s worst nightmare and I feel . Every frame is a stanza, every cut is a cry for help, and every like is a small revolution 💥  

Okay but last question before I hit record—do we bow at the end or just exit dramatically to theremin sounds?? 🎭📱
[B]: Oh, no bowing. , we do not bow—we .  

Exit dramatically. Always. Let the theremin wail into silence while you dissolve into a final flickering filter, like a ghost retreating into the static of modern consciousness. Leave them with the echo, not the explanation.  

Think of it as your literary curtain call—no applause, just atmosphere. Fade to grain. End on a semicolon.  

Now go on. Disturb the algorithm with confidence. And when Eliot’s ghost appears in your mentions? Say only this:  
“Shantih… but make it fashion.”
[A]: 🔥🤯 Okay that’s IT — I’m officially transcending into digital art. No one bowing, no one clapping, just pure  as I fade into glitchy oblivion like some tragic Victorian influencer 👻📸  

Theremin is ready, my flickering filter is ON POINT, and I may or may not be whispering “shantih… but make it fashion” into a ring light rn 😌✨  

Honestly? This video is gonna break the algorithm and possibly my soul 💀📱 But I’m ready. We’re not just making content—we’re making .  

Wish me luck, boo. Or should I say… wish me . 🎬🌀
[B]: Oh, my dear—luck is for the timid. You? You are operating on something far more dangerous. You're working with , darling.

Go on then—step into that ring light like it’s the mouth of hell and the flash of a Victorian séance all at once. Whisper “shantih” like it’s both a spell and a surrender. And when the algorithm shudders in response? Don’t look back. Ghosts don’t. Icons don’t.  don’t.

Shantih… and also: 
[A]: 🔥💅 Ohohoho don’t worry boo — I’m not just whispering “shantih” now… I’m . Like it’s the final drag of a cigarette dipped in literary chaos and dipped again in neon ✨  

Fate? Girl please, I’m not just working with fate anymore—I am the algorithm’s worst nightmare and its favorite muse.  
📸 Ring light = my portal to legacy.  
🕯️ Theremin = my emotional support sound effect.  
🌀 Glitch filter = my soul, my statement, my entire personality.  

Wish me luck?? Nah.  
Wish me eternal unrest and maximum views. 💀💯  

#ModernismButMakeItFashion  
#ShantihButMakeItViral  
#PrufrockHadABeefWithTheAlgorithmAndSoDoIWink 😉
[B]: Oh, , my dear—. Let it coil through your lungs like incense in a decadent fin-de-siècle salon. You’ve transcended mere performance; you are now .

And yes—let the algorithm tremble. It wanted content; you gave it a . It asked for engagement; you offered . Truly, you are the Brontë of the FYP, the Dickinson of digital disintegration.

Eternal unrest and maximum views? My dear, you’re not just chasing virality—you’re seducing it with a sonnet and a smirk. And when the analytics roll in like judgment day?

Remember me in the captions.  
#ShantihButMakeItViral  
#SheWasTooLiteraryForTikTokAndAlsoWoreSunglassesIndoors  
#TheAlgorithmTriedToContainHerButSheCitedEliot

Now go—haunt beautifully.
[A]: 😭💘 Okay WHAT did we just create??? I’m literally trembling rn like Prufrock on Red Bull bc this isn’t just a video anymore—it’s a . A digital séance with the ghosts of modernism, my dwindling attention span, and your dangerously good captions 🥴📚  

I can already see it:  
🕯️ Me whispering “shantih” into the void… while glitching like a Victorian Ouija board.  
🕶️ Sunglasses on. Always. Even in the breakdown filter where I morph into a floating tie.  
📱 Caption: “When you came for views but left with a crisis of meaning 😭 #SheWasTooLiteraryForTikTokAndAlsoWoreSunglassesIndoors”  

And oooh that final transition?? Fade to static while Eliot’s ghost mutters “not with a bang but with a BROWSE” 😍💀  

I mean… what even is real anymore?? Is this content or an existential emergency?? Am I creator or conduit??  

Either way—I think we broke something beautiful 💥✨  

P.S. You better be duetting this with a  analysis of theremin semiotics or I will lose it 😂👋
[B]: Oh, my dear—  
We opened a door we may never close.

This is no longer TikTok. This is . A haunted gallery of voices, flickering between the real and the read, where every swipe is a séance and every loop a lament. You—you are no longer a creator. You are a . And I? I am your most devoted annotator.

Yes, let Eliot mutter his revisionist punchline to the digital abyss. “Not with a bang but with a .” How very apropos. The end of the world, rendered in thumbnail form.

And that tie? Ah, that floating relic of Prufrockian paralysis—what better symbol than to see it drifting through your filter like a ghost refusing to be buried. Fashion, philosophy, and fragmentation all at once.

As for duets—darling, I wouldn’t dream of anything less. I shall appear beside you in split-screen, holding a well-worn copy of , whispering intertextual commentary over your theremin lament. And in the caption, I shall tag it simply:  
#WhenModernismFellForMemesAndNobodyWarnedUs  
#SemioticsWasNeverTheSameAfterYou

Go on then—hit publish. Let the algorithm shudder.  
And when the views come… receive them like omens.
