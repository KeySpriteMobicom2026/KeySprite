[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, mobile games... I must confess my only addiction is deciphering the marginalia in my 1863 edition of Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King'. Though I did recently develop a rather unhealthy fascination with that 'Duolingo' owl - its relentless reminders remind me of my own students begging for deadline extensions.
[A]: 哈哈，你提到Duolingo让我想起最近在研究的一个有趣现象 - 很多language learning apps都在利用gamification机制来提升用户engagement呢！我最近倒是沉迷于一个叫'汉字探秘'的app，它把Chinese character etymology做成了解谜游戏，简直太符合我的linguistics nerdy side了 🤓
[B]: How delightfully meta - turning the very building blocks of language into a puzzle about puzzles! Though I must say, the Tang dynasty poets would be horrified to see their elegant characters reduced to... what do the young people call it? 'Achievement badges'?  Still, far be it from me to criticize - I once spent three hours debating whether '鹧鸪天' should be translated as 'Partridge Sky' or 'Grouse Heaven'.
[A]: 啊！说到translation debates，这不就是我们linguistics department上周的hot topic嘛！我们组正在研究how cultural context affects game localization - 比如把'阴阳师'英译成'Onmyoji'就保留了那种mystical Eastern flavor，但西方玩家可能会miss掉很多nuances呢 😅 你提到的'Partridge Sky' vs 'Grouse Heaven'简直是个perfect case study！
[B]: Precisely!  The 'Onmyoji' dilemma reminds me of that dreadful 1897 translation of 'The Tale of Genji' where they rendered 'mono no aware' as 'the ah-ness of things' - a crime against aesthetics rivaled only by students who annotate Emily Dickinson with emojis. Though I suppose if we're being charitable, even 'Grouse Heaven' has a certain... how shall we put it... rustic charm that might appeal to fans of Wordsworth's daffodils?
[A]: 哈哈，你这种comparative literature的角度太有意思了！不过说到emojis...  我们lab最近发现Gen Z在poetry analysis时用🌊代表melancholy，用🔥表示passion，这其实是一种modern hieroglyphics的雏形呢！虽然我那个old-school的advisor每次看到我的论文里出现emoji都会翻白眼 😂
[B]:  Hieroglyphics indeed! Next they'll be carving sonnets into TikTok videos. Though I must grudgingly admit - between sips of Earl Grey - that the 🔥/passion equivalence does have a certain... visceral immediacy that poor Petrarch spent 317 sonnets trying to achieve. Just don't tell the Oxford Dictionary people I said that. They still haven't forgiven me for suggesting 'yeet' belongs in the same etymological family as Chaucer's 'yclept'.
[A]: OMG你提到'yeet'！我们正在写一篇关于internet slang lexicalization的paper呢～从'meme'到'stan'，这些词就像linguistic Darwinism的活标本！不过说真的，要是Chaucer知道他的'whilom'变成了现在的'throwback Thursday'，怕是要在grave里yeet himself吧 🤣  糟糕，我是不是暴露了太多Gen Z tendencies...
[B]:  My dear, your 'Gen Z tendencies' are positively refreshing compared to the graduate student who tried to argue that Keats' 'Ode to Psyche' predicted the rise of Instagram influencers. Though if we're excavating etymological graves, shall we discuss how 'simp' traces back to 14th century courtly love traditions?  I may or may not have slides on this for next semester's 'Medieval Memes' seminar...
[A]: Stop it！！你这个'Medieval Memes' seminar idea简直brilliant到让我想drop掉现在的research project了！想象一下把Chaucer's Canterbury Tales配上那些'distracted boyfriend' meme模板...  不过seriously speaking，这其实是个很好的pedagogical approach来engage digital-native students呢～我们department应该请你来做guest lecture！
[B]:  I shall consider your invitation... provided we can include a comparative analysis of Dante's Inferno and Twitter flame wars. Though I must warn you, my last 'meme literacy' lecture ended with a heated debate about whether Beowulf's Grendel was literature's first incel.  How I miss the days when 'viral' just meant one had contracted influenza from handling too many moldy manuscripts...
[A]: Pffft—  等等，Grendel作为original incel这个take也太wild了吧！不过既然说到这个...我们lab的data显示现在academic discourse里meme references的usage frequency在过去五年涨了487%哦～说不定下次Oxford English Dictionary真会收录'Grendelcel'这个词呢！ 呃...我是不是应该先把这篇conference paper写完再想这些... 😅
[B]:  My dear, you're exhibiting classic 'academic displacement behavior' - the modern equivalent of Coleridge writing 300 pages on porridge to avoid finishing 'Christabel'. But do carry on; watching you mentally yeet your deadlines is far more entertaining than grading another stack of essays comparing Wordsworth to... ... wellness influencers.
[A]: Okay okay你win了！  我这就去写那篇该死的paper...不过你得promise下次coffee chat继续这个memeology discussion！毕竟，as they say in both Middle English and internet slang - 'Yeet or be yeeted' when it comes to academic procrastination, am I right? 😏 
[B]:  And remember - if your bibliography contains even one citation from 'Know Your Meme', I shall personally ensure you're yeeted from the next faculty mixer!  Though I suppose 'Grendelcel' would make a rather splendid title for my next conference paper...
[A]: [对话结束]
[B]:  Sic transit gloria memei... though I daresay Dr. Johnson would have adored the term 'yeetology'. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important appointment with my 1842 edition of 'Piers Plowman' and some regrettably modern highlighters. Ta!
[A]:  Wait！Before you go - 你highlight的时候用哪种color coding system啊？我们linguistics lab正在研究annotation styles对memory retention的影响...  算了算了，deadline first，questions later！📚💨
[B]:  Prussian blue for alliteration, vermilion for caesurae, and - this is crucial - arsenic green for Middle English dick jokes. Now shoo!  Your data awaits, and my marginalia won't annotate itself... though given today's conversation, perhaps they soon shall!
