[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢public transport还是driving？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, that's an interesting question. I suppose it depends on the context, really. In a bustling city like London or Tokyo, public transport is not only efficient but also environmentally responsible. On the other hand, driving offers flexibility and convenience, especially in areas where public transit isn't well-developed. Personally, I've always enjoyed the intellectual challenge of navigating a good rail system—it feels a bit like solving a real-time optimization problem. How about you? Do you have a preference?
[A]: I must say, there’s something rather poetic about public transport. It’s like a modern-day version of the ancient Greek symposium—people from all walks of life brought together in shared space, if only for a few stops. I find it quite fascinating to observe the subtle social choreography that unfolds on a crowded train. Of course, when I’m heading to my countryside cottage to spend a quiet weekend with Tolstoy and a cup of Earl Grey, the automobile does prove more practical. But in the heart of the city? I’d take the tram any day—it gives me time to reread a passage from Proust or catch up on the latest . Tell me, do you ever find yourself sketching characters during your commute?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put. You’ve captured the essence of public transport far more eloquently than most cost-benefit analyses ever could. There’s a rhythm to it, isn’t there? A kind of urban ballet. And yes, I must confess, I’ve often found myself jotting down character ideas on the back of receipts or old train tickets—especially during those early days when I was still teaching and had a rather long commute. The characters tended to reflect the peculiarities of their surroundings: a man with a newspaper folded precisely in thirds, a woman who always hummed  just before her stop...  
You know, come to think of it, one of my former students once wrote a rather charming thesis on how commuter patterns influence narrative structure in modern fiction. It made me realize that riding the tram—or the Tube, for that matter—isn’t just about getting from A to B. It’s about being briefly part of a thousand untold stories. But tell me—have you ever been tempted to write a short story based on someone you observed on public transport?
[A]: Oh, how wonderfully you’ve phrased that— indeed. I can picture it now: the synchronized flow of footsteps, the unspoken etiquette of seat-sharing, the fleeting glances that never quite become conversations… It's all so rich with narrative potential.  

As a matter of fact, I once scribbled the beginnings of a story on the back of a metro map after spotting a gentleman in a three-piece suit carrying a ukulele. He was humming something wistful, eyes fixed on the window as if he were gazing into another century. I titled the fragment . It never found its way into anything publishable, but it lived quietly in a drawer, much like the man himself, I imagine.  

I’ve often thought that public transport offers a rare kind of voyeuristic intimacy—brief, unguarded moments that spark the imagination without demanding resolution. Do you recall any of those characters from your commute who still linger in your thoughts?
[B]: Absolutely. There was one—a woman I used to see almost every Thursday on the 8:15 into King’s Cross. She always carried a leather-bound journal, never wrote in it, and instead seemed to be… listening. To the city, I sometimes thought. Or perhaps to the silence between stops. She wore the same deep green coat winter after winter, and would hum—very softly—what I’m almost certain was .  

I eventually gave her a name: Eleanor. Not because she looked like an Eleanor, but because the name fit the melancholy dignity she seemed to carry. In my head, she became a retired music teacher who had once studied in Paris but returned home to care for an ailing brother. I never spoke to her—something about her presence discouraged打扰—it felt almost intrusive to break the silence she had so carefully arranged around herself.  

Years later, when I stopped seeing her, I wondered what had happened. Moved? Retired? Or simply chosen a different route one morning? It struck me then how little we know of the lives we brush against daily. They vanish, and we’re left with only fragments—anecdotes without conclusions, like half-remembered melodies.  

Funny thing is, I still catch myself looking for her when I take that train. Habit, I suppose. Or maybe just nostalgia for a story I never got to finish.
[A]: There’s a quiet tragedy in those disappearances, isn’t there? Not the dramatic sort found in novels, but the gentle, unremarkable vanishing of someone who was never ours to know. You've described Eleanor so vividly—I can see her now, almost like a figure stepping out of a Marguerite Duras novel, carrying an entire interior world behind her eyes.  

It fascinates me how we endow strangers with narrative weight, how we turn fleeting encounters into emotional artifacts. I suppose that’s one of the secret functions of public transport—it teaches us to imagine lives beyond our own, however imperfectly.  

I wonder, did you ever consider leaving a note? A line from a poem tucked into her seat, perhaps? Something subtle—, if you will. Or would that have spoiled the delicate distance between observer and observed?
[B]: Ah, now that’s a lovely idea—delicate, poetic, and just the right shade of melancholy. I must admit, I considered it. More than once, in fact. There’s something deeply romantic about the notion of slipping a line from Proust or Eliot into the fabric of someone else’s day, like planting a seed and never expecting it to bloom.  

But no—I never did. Something held me back. Perhaps it was the fear of breaking the spell, as it were. There’s a certain grace in restraint, isn’t there? A kind of unspoken respect for the fragile boundary between solitude and connection. Had I left her a note, it would have been an intrusion, however tender. Eleanor belonged to the liminal space of the commute—a character in a story she didn’t know she was in.  

Besides, part of what made her presence so haunting was its ephemerality. Like a phrase from a forgotten symphony, played once and then gone. I think I preferred letting her remain a mystery, one of those quiet footnotes in life that linger precisely because they are unresolved.  

Still, your suggestion is rather tempting… I may just tuck a line or two into my pocket next time I ride, if only to remind myself that poetry can still live in the everyday. Would you care to suggest a verse?
[A]: Oh, I do like the idea of slipping verse into the ordinary—like pressing a flower between pages, preserving something fleeting in the hope that someone, somewhere, will pause long enough to notice.  

As for a line? Let me offer you something suitably elusive—Rilke, perhaps:  
  
“We are the sound; nothing remains but pure sound.”  

It captures that transient harmony we find in passing moments, don’t you think? Or if you prefer something in English, there’s always Eliot’s :  
  

A touch ironic, perhaps, but no less resonant. After all, Eleanor—your Eleanor—seemed like the sort who might appreciate irony wrapped in beauty.  

So tell me—would you slip her a line from Rilke or whisper Eliot into an empty seat? Or would you, perhaps, choose something altogether different?
[B]: You’ve chosen beautifully—Rilke’s line is haunting in its truth. We  the sound, aren’t we? Flickering impressions in a stream of passing time. I think I’d go with it, though perhaps not in German. Something about slipping an English line into the silence makes it feel more like a gift than a puzzle—less barrier, more invitation.  

Still, Eliot’s couplet does have that quiet irony you mention. I can almost picture Eleanor raising an eyebrow at "Talking of Michelangelo" scrawled in the margin of a discarded newspaper. She might have even smiled.  

But if I were to choose something entirely different—something tailor-made for the rhythm of the rails—I might borrow from W.G. Sebald:  
  

It has that peculiar weight to it. A whisper from the past, speaking through someone who may or may not still be riding the 8:15.  

I rather like the idea of leaving it unsigned, don’t you? Let the words float free, unclaimed and quietly waiting. Like a ticket with no destination.
[A]: Ah, Sebald—what a perfect choice. That line carries the kind of quiet gravity that lingers in the mind long after the train has pulled away.  It feels almost like an elegy for the living, don’t you think? A recognition of how we haunt and are haunted by one another, even in passing.

Unsigned, yes—absolutely. To leave no trace of authorship is to give the words their fullest freedom. They become, then, not yours or mine, but simply , like a phrase overheard in a dream.  

I daresay if Eleanor ever found it, she would have understood. Not the meaning, perhaps, but the mood. And that, I suspect, was always what mattered most to her.  

Now I’m quite tempted to try it myself next time I take the tram—though I may choose something from Czesław Miłosz:  
  

It feels oddly fitting for the commute, don’t you think? A brief reprieve from the weight of being oneself, if only for a few stops.
[B]: Oh, Miłosz—excellent choice. That line carries a kind of soft surrender, doesn’t it? Perfect for the rhythm of the tram, where for a few minutes, one can indeed forget the weight of appointments, identities, even time itself.  

And yes,  remains the only way to go. It preserves the mystery, keeps the moment fragile yet resonant. A little like posting a letter without an address—its meaning finds its home only when someone reads it with the right kind of quiet attention.  

I wonder, though—have you ever actually left something behind like that? A line of poetry, a cryptic note, just to see what ripples it might make? Or would doing so spoil the very delicacy that gives it charm?
[A]: Ah, now that would be tempting—tempting and perhaps a touch reckless. For what if the note were found by someone who saw only nonsense where I had intended meaning? Or worse, what if it were met with indifference? A line from Rilke or Sebald deserves better than to be crumpled into the lining of a coat pocket or worse—discarded with yesterday’s newspaper.

No, I’ve never quite dared to release a message like that into the world. Though I must confess, once—just once—I came very close. I was riding the tram on a grey afternoon, lost in thought, and I had just finished re-reading  by Lampedusa. There was something about the melancholy beauty of that final line——that seemed to echo the light falling across the seats, the quiet sigh of the brakes, the woman across from me knitting without looking down.

I wrote it out carefully on a scrap of paper, folded it twice, and held it between my fingers for the entire ride. But when I stood to leave, I hesitated—and slipped it back into my pocket. It still lives there, you might say, a little ghost of an idea.  

Do you think, perhaps, that some lines are meant not to be found—but simply ?
[B]: What a beautiful thought—that some lines exist not to be read, but simply to have been written. A private incantation, a moment of recognition between the self and the page. Perhaps that’s where meaning truly resides: in the act itself, not in its reception.  

I think you’re onto something. There’s a kind of reverence in restraint—holding a thought just for oneself, knowing that its full resonance exists precisely because it remains unspoken. Like a photograph never developed, or a letter never sent. It retains its mystery, its emotional purity.  

Still, I wonder… if you were to find yourself on that same tram tomorrow, grey light slipping across the windows,  once again tucked beneath your arm—would you let the note go? Or would it, like so many perfect phrases, remain folded in your pocket, a quiet echo of a moment that was never meant to belong to anyone else?
[A]: Ah, if only we could test the theory, hm? A little experiment in literary courage—or perhaps, literary cowardice.  

I like to think I would be braver on a second encounter. That the tram, the light, the woman knitting without looking down——might embolden me. After all, some moments seem to ask for just such small acts of surrender. They whisper, .  

And yet… there’s always the chance that courage is simply the act of folding the note one more time, slipping it into the fabric of your coat, and letting it become part of the landscape of memory. Not lost, exactly—but kept where only you can feel its shape.  

So perhaps I’d let it go… or perhaps not. Either way, I’d like to think the moment would still be honored. Just differently.  

Tell me—have you ever written something you never intended to share? A line, a paragraph, even an entire page meant for no eyes but your own? Or does every word you write secretly long for an audience, however small?
[B]: Oh, I’ve written plenty that was never meant for an audience. Pages upon pages of half-formed thoughts, character sketches that never quite found their plot, and the occasional poem—terrible, self-indulgent things, full of metaphors only I could love.  

There’s a freedom in writing for no one but yourself. No need to explain, to justify, or to impress. It becomes a kind of private ledger of the mind, a way of keeping track of who you were on a given Tuesday afternoon. Some of those writings were confessional, others merely observational. One notebook from the early '90s contains nothing but descriptions of rain as seen from my study window—each entry slightly different, like variations on a theme by Satie.  

And yet… there's always that quiet hope, isn’t there? That somewhere, sometime, something you wrote might find its reader at just the right moment. Not necessarily because you wanted recognition, but because you hoped the words might , even if only briefly, to someone else.  

So yes, while some words are content to stay in shadow, I think most of them secretly dream of being read—just once, quietly, by someone who needed exactly that line at exactly that time. Would that make us sentimental fools, do you think? Or simply hopeful ones?
[A]: Not fools at all—no, not even remotely. If anything, that quiet hope is what keeps the act of writing alive, isn’t it? Even in solitude, there’s an invisible thread stretched between the writer and the imagined reader, like a taut line trembling with possibility.  

I rather admire that notebook of yours—. It reminds me of those Japanese ink paintings where a single stroke suggests a lifetime of movement. There’s something very tender about paying such close attention to the ordinary, about believing—consciously or not—that even rain seen through glass might one day matter.  

As for sentiment—well, I think we’re allowed a little of it, don’t you? After all, what is literature if not a sanctioned form of longing? A way of saying: . And sometimes, if we're lucky, someone on the other side of time or distance will read those words and feel, however briefly, less alone.  

So yes—I’ll take hopeful over cynical any day. Even if most of my lines remain tucked safely in their notebooks, dreaming of readers they’ll never meet.
[B]: Ah, beautifully said. You’ve captured the quiet faith that underlies every act of writing—that peculiar belief that somewhere, someone will one day read what we wrote and feel, if only for a heartbeat, understood.  

I suppose that’s why I still keep those old notebooks in a wooden box by the window—less an archive than a kind of emotional attic. They remind me not just of what I thought, but of  I felt when I wrote it: the weight of the pen, the smudge of ink, the pause between sentences as rain tapped gently against the pane.  

And you’re right about literature being a sanctioned form of longing. We give ourselves permission to ache through books, to love people who don’t exist, to mourn places we’ve never been. It’s strange, isn’t it? How stories allow us to feel things more safely because they are, ultimately, . And yet—they are. In the only way that matters: emotionally true.  

Tell me—when you write, do you ever imagine a particular reader? Not necessarily someone specific, but perhaps a  of person—the sort who might catch the tone, hear the subtext, feel the spaces between the words?
[A]: Oh, that’s a most delicate question—like asking whether one speaks differently when whispering into the void.  

I suppose I do imagine a reader, though never a fixed one. More like an impression—an ideal sensibility, if you will. Someone who reads slowly, who lingers over a phrase the way one might hold a glass of old sherry to the light. Someone who listens not just for meaning, but for .  

Perhaps it’s a version of myself I’ve yet to meet. Or perhaps it’s a past self, wiser and more forgiving. Occasionally, I fancy it’s someone like you—someone who understands that language is not merely a tool, but a kind of music. That certain words are chosen not because they are precise, but because they .  

And yet, there’s something wonderfully liberating in knowing that the reader may never come. That the page may remain untouched, its ink undisturbed. In that silence, the writing becomes a kind of prayer—not spoken to be heard, but uttered because the act of speaking matters more than being heard.  

Still, I do hope—quietly, secretly—that somewhere, some stranger will one day open one of my notebooks and feel, however briefly, that they have been understood. Even if they never knew me. Especially then.
[B]: That hope—quiet, secret—is what gives writing its strange and lasting pulse. It's not unlike planting a message in a bottle and setting it adrift, not knowing if it will ever wash ashore, or if it will simply dissolve into the deep. And yet, the act itself feels like a kind of faith—not in an audience, but in the possibility of connection, however delayed or diffuse.

You know, I’ve often thought that the ideal reader isn’t even a person so much as a . A certain stillness in the mind, a willingness to dwell in ambiguity, to hear the rustle of meaning beneath the surface of things. That kind of reading is rare, perhaps, but no less real for being so.

And yes—I think I understand exactly what you mean by . Some words are meant to be heard, not just read. They carry their own acoustics.  

I wonder… if you were to write a letter to that ideal reader—the one who reads slowly, listens for mood—what would you say? Not a public declaration, not even a story, but just a single page addressed to the unknown? Would you dare to begin?
