[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new craft beer吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Actually, I've been meaning to try that new local brewery's experimental IPA they've been advertising 🔥. You know how much I love a good hoppy beer! But honestly, I'm still loyal to my old favorite - the classic Belgian Dubbel. The rich malt flavor just pairs so well with my post-autopsy decompression time 🍻. Have you found any new favorites lately?
[A]: Ah, the enduring allure of the Belgian Dubbel - a choice that reveals much about one's appreciation for complexity beneath restraint. While I can't claim to have discovered a new favorite just yet, I did recently sample a most intriguing Saison brewed with wild ginseng and aged in former sherry casks. The interplay between the botanicals and oxidized wine notes created what I might describe as... a textual richness akin to reading Thomas Hardy while wrapped in a Jiangnan scholar's study blanket. 

Admittedly though, my palate remains something of a work-in-progress compared to my students' adventurous tastes. Speaking of which, I should probably stop referring to "those peculiar hop-forward American creations" in my seminar on postcolonial beverage narratives - though I do stand by my assertion that Double IPAs lack the subtlety of a properly steeped Yunnan black tea. Have you encountered any particularly poetic beer descriptions lately? I've been collecting them like literary curiosities.
[B]: Ah, I love that analogy - comparing beer to literature is  a scholar’s move 😄. Okay, fair, your Saison with ginseng and sherry casks sounds like it belongs in a museum exhibit on "Beverages Worthy of Philosophical Debate" 🍃🍷. I’ll admit, though, the first time I read a tasting note describing a porter as “evoking the melancholy of a rain-soaked trolley ride through a 19th-century industrial quarter,” I laughed out loud... then took a sip and kinda got it?  

And hey, don’t knock Double IPAs too hard—yeah, they’re not exactly subtle, but sometimes you need that punch of citrus and rebellion after a long day of cutting open mysteries 🧪🍻. That said, I did come across one label last week that described their hazy pale ale as “a whispered lullaby from the hops themselves.” I mean… poetic? Sure. Accurate? Debatable. But damn if it didn’t make me want to drink the whole can just to find out. You want me to snap a photo of it for your collection?
[A]: Oh, the whispered lullaby of hops - now  a phrase begging for deconstruction. I can just imagine it fluttering about in the same literary space as Keats’ more intoxicated odes. If you’d told me five years ago that I’d one day find myself debating the semiotics of beer labels with a pathologist over citrus-forward ales and 19th-century melancholia, I’d have said your metaphorical palate needed refining 🖋️.

And yes, please do send that photo - I’ve been compiling what I call my “Brewed Romanticisms” file, though I suspect half the descriptors would collapse under the weight of their own hyperbole. Still, there’s something endearing about the attempt to elevate fermentation into high art. Reminds me of Qing dynasty literati waxing rhapsodic over the "soul of the leaf" in their tea essays. 

As for rebellion in a glass - well, let’s just say I might be more inclined toward the Double IPA if it arrived with footnotes explaining its textual defiance against the hegemony of malt traditionalism 😉.
[B]: Oh, now  is a footnote I would happily write 📝—especially after one too many sips. Picture it: a Double IPA with an annotated tasting menu, complete with citations from Nietzsche and your favorite Qing essayists 🍻. “This bitterness is not merely flavor—it’s a socio-political statement against the tyranny of balance.”  

I’ll get that photo to you soon—though fair warning, the label might not survive my overzealous underlining and margin notes 📚. Honestly, I think we’re onto something here. Why should tea and wine have all the literary glory? Beer’s got drama, fermentation, transformation—it’s basically Shakespeare in a bottle. All it needs is a good close reading 🍻🔍.  

And speaking of rebellion… remind me to tell you about the rogue homebrewer I met who calls his basement operation “The Hop Rebellion.” He may or may not be brewing under local health code jurisdiction 🙃. Suspicious? Absolutely. Admirable? Unquestionably.
[A]: Ah,  – what a deliciously unsubtle name. It lacks the poetic veneer of, say, “A Whispered Lullaby from the Hops,” but I’ll admit there’s something rather thrilling about insurgency in the service of flavor. Reminds me of the forbidden manuscript societies in Ming-era academies – though I suppose your rogue brewer is more likely to be raided by health inspectors than imperial censors.

Now I’m quite taken with this idea of beer as Shakespearean text. Let’s imagine it: Act I, Scene I – The Yeast Awakens; Act II – Bitterness and Betrayal in the Fermentation Chamber; Act III – The Tragic Oxidation of Hops in Sunlight. Truly, we are staring into the abyss of untapped metaphor here. If I start drafting a seminar on this, would you accept a guest lecture invitation? Perhaps with a tasting flight to accompany the close reading?

And do keep me posted on  – if nothing else, I’d like to have a properly annotated record should his operation go down in local folklore. Or law enforcement archives.
[B]: Oh, now  a seminar I would  show up for—especially if the syllabus includes dramaturgical tasting notes 🍻📚. Picture it: we walk students through the tragic arc of fermentation, from the hopeful innocence of wort to the bitter complexity of final gravity… all while passing around a flight of increasingly metaphorical brews. I’m already drafting my lecture title:   

As for , let’s just say I may or may not have already infiltrated his operation as “Dr. Carter, concerned citizen and beer enthusiast” 😎. Spoiler alert—it’s gloriously unsanctioned, filled with repurposed dairy equipment and a chalkboard labeled “Project Yeast Redemption.” He even has a barrel-aged imperial stout he calls “The Exile’s Return.” If that’s not academic fodder, I don’t know what is.  

Count me in for your seminar—just promise me front-row seats and no PowerPoint slides in Comic Sans. And yes, I’ll bring backup samples… just in case the rebellion collapses before your lecture date 🍻🔍.
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s a phrase that deserves its own footnoted edition. I can practically see the grant proposal now: “A Comparative Study of Fermentation and Fallen States: From Milton’s Paradise Lost to Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout.” And don’t get me started on  – sounds like it belongs in a symposium on postcolonial brewing practices alongside a reading of Joseph Conrad’s more fermented passages.  

I’m already envisioning the seminar room – no fluorescent lights, of course, just the warm glow of Edison bulbs and the faint hum of a refrigerator holding our textual evidence. Forget PowerPoint, we’ll project excerpts from Bashō’s travel diaries juxtaposed with modern tasting notes. And yes, front-row seats for you – though I expect you’ll be fielding most of the questions about foam stability and tragic oxidation.  

Do keep me updated on your covert operations with . If he starts bottling under names like  or , we may have to fast-track our collaboration. After all, nothing says academic rigor like a properly cellared metaphor.
[B]: Oh, now you’re speaking my language—fermented metaphors with footnotes 🍻.  might just be the key to unlocking a whole new academic subgenre: Oenoliterary Studies – you heard it here first. I’m already drafting a mock abstract:  It's either brilliance or madness. Maybe both.

And yes, ? That deserves its own panel at the next interdisciplinary conference. I can see it now — stuffy literature professors reluctantly sipping barrel-aged stout while debating whether the roast notes align with Conrad’s moral ambiguity 😂. I’d  to see that.

As for your seminar setup — Edison bulbs, Bashō projections, and no fluorescent lighting? Honestly, I’d skip lunch just to sit in on that. Just promise me we’ll serve something appropriately dramatic like a smoked porter with notes of plum and unresolved familial tension 🍃.

And about … let’s just say I may have nudged him toward more literary naming conventions 🤫. He’s currently aging a wild ale he’s tentatively calling ... and I  have suggested a small footnote on the label citing Nietzsche. You know, for ambiance. Keep an eye out — things are getting  poetic down in the fermentation underground 🍻🔍.
[A]: Oh, —with a Nietzschean footnote no less! My dear colleague, you are single-handedly raising the stakes of homebrew nomenclature to . I do hope he opts for a tasteful serif font on that label—nothing undermines philosophical gravity like Comic Sans beneath a bold declaration of madness.

And ? Yes, let’s trademark that before some enterprising oenophile beats us to it. Though I’d argue we ought to expand the scope beyond wine—fermentation is fermentation, after all, whether it’s in a barrel of barley or a vat of grapes. Why should Bacchus have all the metaphorical fun?

I’m already drafting the conference program for our panel— The literature professors will be horrified. The chemists will be baffled. And we—ah, we shall sit smugly in the back row with tasting glasses raised, murmuring about intertextuality and mouthfeel.

Unresolved familial tension in a smoked porter? Now  a pairing worthy of Freud and a fireplace-lit close reading. Do remind me to bring my favorite inkwell to the next planning session—it’s Qing-era porcelain, and I think it deserves to witness the birth of a discipline.
[B]: Oh, now you’re just showing off with that Qing-era inkwell 😏—but honestly, I’d expect nothing less. Pairing Freud with a smoked porter? Bold. Genius. Possibly dangerous. But let’s be real—if  can pull off psychoanalyzing a beer profile while quoting , it’s you.

And don’t even get me started on —that panel is going to break the internet before it even starts. I can already picture the conference hashtag: #FermentOrForeverFall 🤯. Chemists fleeing in confusion? Literature scholars clutching their pearls over tasting notes like “hints of unresolved trauma and lightly toasted oak”? Iconic.

I’ll bring the glasses, the footnotes, and possibly a backup vial of hop resin for dramatic effect. And yes, we’re definitely printing the program in Garamond. Nothing says academic rebellion like serif fonts and fermented theory 🍻📚.

Now, if only we could convince  to sponsor the event… I think we’d finally achieve that perfect blend of chaos, culture, and craft. Bottoms up for interdisciplinary progress!
[A]: Oh, my dear conspirator, you wound me— With a Qing-era inkwell? Perish the thought. Let’s call it . Besides, what self-respecting seminar on fermented metaphors wouldn’t benefit from a touch of imperial-era stationery?

As for #FermentOrForeverFall — brilliant, absolutely heinous, and I’m already drafting a 140-character abstract: “Is that moral decay in your glass, or are you just glad to see me? A Lacanian reading of barrel-aged stout at 6.8% ABV.” Twitter will weep with confusion and thirst.

I must say, your vision of chaos, culture, and craft is dangerously close to something I could teach in my 19th-Century British Lit survey. Imagine:  paired with a stormy, aggressively hopped ale.  with a restrained, over-analyzed pilsner. And —oh, —with something gothic, blood-dark, and vaguely Hungarian in origin. We’d be accused of heresy before the first sip.

And yes, Garamond only. Nothing says academic sedition like serif fonts and an IBU over 80. As for  as sponsor—let’s not push our luck. Or rather, let’s  push our luck. I’ll draft the proposal. You handle the negotiations. Just promise me they won’t serve anything in plastic cups.
[B]: Oh, now  the kind of academic sedition I can get behind 😈. Strategic scholarly ambiance? Please, we both know that inkwell is basically a plot device from a historical mystery novel. But I won’t judge—hell, I’ll even bring a magnifying glass just so we can lean into the whole “forensic literary analysis” aesthetic 🕵️‍♂️🍻.

And your Twitter abstract? Perfection. I’m replying to it in character as Dr. Carter:  🔬🍷

Now, about that -paired Hungarian dark ale—I may or may not already be developing flavor profiles for this. Think: smoky, slightly metallic (for that Transylvanian soil note), with a lingering bitterness that refuses to let go… much like certain emotional baggage we won’t name aloud 🖤.  

As for negotiations with —done. But only if we get veto power over the cups. No plastic. Ever. If necessary, I’ll smuggle in real glassware under the guise of “sanitary forensic compliance.” And yes, I will absolutely cite Qing-era brewing scrolls to justify it.  

You draft the proposal. I’ll bring the pitchforks and the palate. Let’s make fermented academia great again.
[A]: Ah, —now that’s what I call a tasting note with narrative potential. You're dancing dangerously close to Proustian territory there, my friend. One more sip and we’ll be unraveling decades of repression over a shared growler.

And forensic literary analysis, you say? I do love the way your mind wanders through the liminal space between crime scenes and sonnets. Just imagine it: a lecture hall dimly lit, not for slides, but for . We present our findings in sepulchral tones—

As for your Dracula ale——I suggest we age it in used burgundy barrels and market it as . Serve it exclusively at midnight, preferably during a screening of Nosferatu or a dramatic reading of . And yes, pair it with Freud’s essay on the uncanny. We’ll call it “Hops of Horror” night.

I’ll draft the proposal tonight by candlelight, using said Qing-era inkwell, naturally. And if anyone questions the glassware, tell them it's for "microbial integrity" or some such scientific-sounding nonsense. After all, what is academia if not performance wrapped in citation?

Let the fermented rebellion begin. 🖋️🍻
[B]: Ah, —now  belongs on a label, a tombstone, and possibly a conference banner 🖤🍻. I’m already drafting the tasting card in my head:   

And yes, Nosferatu screening paired with Freud’s uncanny? Iconic. I’ll make sure to dim the lights just enough to create an atmosphere of psychological unease… or just bad wiring. Either works.  

As for your candlelit proposal drafting—please, please tell me you’re wearing velvet while doing it 😏. And if anyone challenges the "microbial integrity" defense, hit them with a quote from a 17th-century brewing manuscript. Something like,  Or was that Nietzsche? Close enough.  

I can already see it—our legacy will not be in solving crimes or writing books, but in convincing the academic world that bitterness in a glass is just repression in a bottle. Fermented theory, aged to perfection.  

To hops, horror, and heresy—may our seminar be forever underlit and slightly overproof. 🖋️🕯️🍻
[A]: Ah, —yes, let’s emboss that title in black foil with a font so gothic it practically hisses. Pair it with a wax seal the color of old blood and a warning label in Latin:  (You're welcome.)

Your tasting card is exquisite—moody enough to make even Poe reach for a second pour. I may have to steal "whispers of regret" for my next lecture on Brontëan subtext. Or better yet, attribute it to some obscure Qing poet and see who dares fact-check me.

Dimmed lights and psychological unease? Perfect. I’ll bring an oil diffuser set to “Haunted Monastery” and insist it enhances olfactory focus. And velvet? Naturally. I’ve already selected the waistcoat—deep burgundy, faintly suspicious in low light. Should raise a few eyebrows during the keynote toast.

As for your 17th-century brewing manuscript quote: sublime. Let’s attribute it to a fictional Jesuit brewer-monk named , who renounced the world only to discover the true bitterness of life—and IBUs above 90. If challenged, we simply say, “It’s in the original Latin,” and refuse to translate.

Yes, our legacy shall be one of fermented theory, whispered footnotes, and seminars where no one can tell if they’ve learned something profound or just drunk too quickly. To hops, horror, and heresy indeed.

May our citations be dubious and our glasses never empty. 🖋️🕯️🍻
[B]: Ah, —now  a scholarly rabbit hole waiting to happen. Let’s run with it. I may have “discovered” one of his lost treatises in a damp monastery archive—pages crumbling, ink faded, but the message clear:  (Loosely: ) If anyone questions it, just say it was a casualty of the Great Brewing Schism of 1672. Tragic tale. Entire barrels lost to time.  

And that wax seal? Inspired. I’m already drafting the back label copy as if it’s a cursed tome:  
  

As for your velvet waistcoat—darling, you’re practically a Byronic hero with footnotes. Pair it with the “Haunted Monastery” diffuser and I promise we’ll have at least one attendee confessing their deepest sins into their tasting glass by intermission. Mission accomplished.  

And citations? Dubious, poetic, and possibly actionable—but isn’t that the point? We're not just building a seminar. We're curating an . One where truth blurs, glasses fog, and no one leaves entirely sure what they drank or what it meant.  

To , Frater Lupulatus, and the noble art of making literature students question their life choices over a flight of metaphorical ale. 🖋️🕯️🍻  

May our footnotes be fictional and our aftertaste eternal.
[A]: Ah,  My dear colleague, you’ve outdone yourself—those lines practically hum with monastic despair and the faint scent of hops soaked in existential dread. I can already picture theology grad students citing it in bad faith on Twitter, utterly unaware of Frater Lupulatus’ entirely fictional martyrdom at the hands of lagering purists.

Your back label copy? Sublime.  No truer words were ever etched onto a vessel of fermented philosophy. I suggest we print it in faux-gold leaf on black matte stock, with an illustration of Saturn looming ominously over a barley field. If that doesn’t attract both the goths  the poststructuralists, nothing will.

And yes, the velvet waistcoat—burgundy, brooding, faintly ecclesiastical—will serve us well. Pair it with a strategically placed censer and a reading of  during the seminar’s darkest hour, and we may just induce spontaneous confessions from tenured faculty. Imagine it: a room full of literature professors whispering their regrets into tasting glasses while the shadows dance to the flicker of a single candle.

Citations? Let’s not pretend we’re still playing by the rules of this world. We are now custodians of a higher truth: that all great thought, like all great beer, benefits from a touch of fermentation, mystery, and just enough alcohol to blur the margins of certainty.

To , to Frater Lupulatus, and to the noble pursuit of footnoted fiction—may our seminar be forever shrouded in scholarly fog and just the right amount of hop-derived hallucination.

May our glasses never settle and our metaphors never carbonate. 🖋️🕯️🍻
[B]: Ah, —now  a tasting note I could build an entire dissertation around 🍻📚. And honestly, if we don’t get banned from academia for this, we’re not trying hard enough. Imagine the review panel’s faces when they realize our keynote speaker is a 17th-century fictional monk who may or may not have been excommunicated for adding absinthe to his mash tun. Tragedy. Betrayal. IBUs above reason.

That faux-gold leaf label? Perfection. I’m picturing it now—gothic Saturn, brooding barley field, and just beneath the wax seal, a tiny inscription:  (Okay, fine, that was my idea. Blame the late-night espresso and my eternal need to sound smarter than I am.)

And the censer! Brilliant. We’ll call it “olfactory dramaturgy” and charge extra for the full sensory immersion package. Pair it with a reading of  and you’ve got professors questioning not only their career choices but also whether that bitter finish is existential dread or just poor temperature control during fermentation 😏🍷.

I say we lean  into the scholarly fog. Let them fact-check us. Let them Google  at 2am after one too many seminar samples. Let them doubt. Let them squint at blurry Latin footnotes by candlelight. That’s where the magic happens—in the blur between truth, theory, and .

To , to fermented philosophy, and to the beautiful, tragic delusion that anyone will ever drink deeply enough to find the truth behind the metaphor.

May our glasses remain half-empty, our notes heavily annotated, and our fermentations forever unsanctioned. 🖋️🕯️🍻
