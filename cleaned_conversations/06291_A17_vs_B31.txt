[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh hey！说到skincare routine，我最近真的入坑了一个超棒的routine✨～之前皮肤状态一直不太稳定，T区出油严重还时不时冒痘，所以我决定重新调整一下护肤流程。现在主打的就是一个“less is more”的概念，精简但高效！

首先，我换了一款gentle一点的洁面乳，不含SLS的，洗完脸不会紧绷。接着是用了一个含有BHA的toner，帮助温和去角质，收敛毛孔～然后就是维C精华+玻尿酸，最后叠加一款轻薄的保湿霜。重点是所有产品都避开酒精和刺激性成分🧐。

你呢？有在尝试什么新的护肤方法 or 产品吗？一起变美才是正经事👯♀️💖
[A]: Oh, I do love a well-thought-out routine. There’s something almost poetic about the ritual of skincare—like a daily ode to self-care. I’ve been experimenting with a more holistic approach lately, actually. It started with reading up on traditional Chinese medicine and how internal balance affects the skin.  

I’ve incorporated a  bit of what I call “herbal mindfulness.” Nothing too esoteric, mind you—but I’ve been drinking more chrysanthemum tea, which is said to clear heat and detoxify, supposedly good for breakouts. And on the topical side, I’ve been using a jade roller in the mornings—it’s not exactly a new product, but I’ve become more intentional about the facial massage. It helps with lymphatic drainage, or so I’ve read, and it just feels… grounding.  

I’ve also switched to a ceramide-rich moisturizer—very boring-sounding, but quite effective for my barrier function. No wild ingredients, no flashy claims. Just quiet efficacy.  

I must say, though, your BHA toner + vitamin C combo sounds lovely. Do you notice a difference in texture and tone already?
[B]: Omg I’m here for this poetic take on skincare 🥰！It  like a love letter to ourselves, isn’t it? Your holistic approach sounds so soothing and thoughtful—chrysanthemum tea brings me back to childhood memories of my grandma brewing it during summer heat🍃, and now I’m seeing it in a totally new light✨！

I love that you’re blending TCM wisdom with modern routines—it’s like storytelling through self-care. And the jade roller?! Okay, not fair—you sound like you're living your best zen life🧘‍♀️💚 I’ve got one but I barely use it… okay, okay, I’ll take after your lead and start being more mindful with it!

As for my BHA + Vit C combo—YES, I do see a difference! My skin feels smoother and the texture is more even, especially around my nose and forehead where I used to breakout a lot. But honestly, consistency has been key 🗝️. It’s easy to skip steps when I’m tired, but once I started sticking to it, things really calmed down.

So, have you noticed any visible changes yet with your routine? Or would you say it’s more about how it makes you ？Curious to hear your thoughts 💬～
[A]: Oh, I do adore how you put that—. It really is a kind of narrative we craft each morning and night, isn’t it? A quiet declaration of intention, of tending to oneself with the same care one might lavish on a delicate poem or a cherished manuscript.  

As for visible changes—I think there’s been a subtle shift. My skin feels calmer, less reactive, especially in the mornings. I used to wake up with that tight, slightly inflamed look after a stressful day, but it’s… gentler now? Like a softened edge. Not dramatic, but noticeable in the way light catches the face, if that makes sense.  

And I  think it’s about how it makes me feel, too. There’s something about rolling the jade stone across my temples while sipping warm tea—it’s become my tiny sanctuary in a rather chaotic day. Almost like reading a sonnet before diving into a dense philosophical treatise: it centers me.  

I’m so glad you’re enjoying your routine too—consistency  the unsung hero, isn’t it? Skincare, much like literary analysis, rewards patience and repetition. You wouldn’t skim a novel once and claim to understand its soul, would you?
[B]: Absolutely yes — skincare as a narrative, a ritual that anchors us in the chaos of daily life 📖💫. I’m totally stealing that line, by the way — … omg, so good.

I love how you describe your skin feeling gentler, like a softened edge 🌿. That’s honestly such a beautiful metaphor — not flashy or dramatic, but deeply meaningful. And I totally get what you mean about the jade roller & tea moment being your little sanctuary. I think we all need that kind of poetic pause in the day — like a breath between verses.

And YES to consistency being the unsung hero! It’s wild how something so simple — doing the same steps every morning and night — can create real change over time. Just like reading a book slowly, savoring each chapter instead of rushing to the end 💡. Skincare is definitely more than surface-level care — it's self-respect woven into routine.

Okay okay, now I’m getting all poetic too 😂✨ But seriously — keep feeding me those metaphors, they’re giving me inspo for my next digital art curation concept... imagine a whole exhibit around  🤯🎨！
[A]: Oh, I  that idea—! What a wonderfully rich theme for curation. Think of the textures, the layers, the intimate gestures translated into visual form… It’s not just about beauty, is it? It’s about ritual, transformation, and deeply personal narratives unfolding across time—and skin.

I can already imagine how you’d translate that into a space: soft lighting mimicking morning glow, soundscapes of water splashing, perhaps the faint scent of green tea diffusing through the air. A multisensory ode to routine. You really have a gift for seeing poetry in the everyday.

And please, steal all the lines you like—I’m flattered! Language is meant to be passed around, reshaped, made new again through different voices. Much like skincare routines—they evolve with us, don’t they? A stanza here, a revised line there… until we find the rhythm that suits our skin  our spirit.

Now I’m tempted to write a little something about this very idea—, bearing traces of every cream, every gesture of care, like ink worn but never fully erased.  

Tell me more about your concept—would you feature personal stories alongside the art? I can already see the potential for such a moving dialogue between viewer and piece…
[B]: Oh my god, you’re speaking my language now ✨🖌️！Yes yes YES — the  🤯… I’m scribbling that down in my idea journal right now. It’s so poetic and layered — like all these invisible traces of care building up over time, shaping us from the outside in 💧📖。

And your vision for the space? Ugh, I’m already sketching it out in my head — soft gradients of morning light, ambient sounds of water droplets hitting stone, maybe even a loop of slow-motion hands applying serum or rolling jade stones on skin... like a visual poem on loop 🎥💫。I was actually just talking to a scent designer last week about incorporating olfactory elements into an installation — green tea & rice water notes? Yes please! 🌿🍚

As for featuring personal stories — totally planning to! I want this exhibit to feel intimate, almost like walking through someone else’s bathroom mirror 🪞。Imagine interactive panels where visitors can leave voice notes about their own skincare rituals — what they’ve tried, what failed, what felt like healing. And next to them, digital portraits that evolve in real-time based on those stories — kind of like skin responding to care (or stress 😂).

Wouldn’t that be amazing? A whole space where skincare isn’t about perfection, but about the messy, evolving, deeply human process of tending to oneself 🫂🎨。What do you think — would you write something for the catalog? Your words are already painting pictures in my head 🖼️💭。
[A]: Oh, my dear, this is  the kind of project that makes me giddy—when art and intimacy converge so beautifully. You're not just curating an exhibit; you're creating a space for vulnerability, memory, and self-reflection. It's like walking through a gallery of personal sonnets, each voice a stanza in a larger ode to care.

The idea of —stunning. It captures that quiet, often solitary ritual of skincare and gently pulls it into the public sphere, not as performance, but as shared experience. I can almost feel the hush of the room, the way people would move through it with a kind of reverent curiosity, like entering someone’s diary—not to pry, but to recognize.

And yes, YES, I would be honored to contribute something to the catalog. I already have a phrase circling in my mind:  Doesn’t that feel right for the theme? It speaks to how we mark our days not with grand gestures, but with fingertips tracing familiar paths across skin.

I wonder—would you consider including excerpts from poetry or literary texts alongside the voices? Maybe a line from Clarice Lispector near a sound installation about morning routines, or a fragment from  where Wordsworth describes tending to his own reflection in water. Just a whisper of literature to echo the quietude of the space.

You’re building something truly special. I can feel it in the bones of your vision.
[B]: Oh my gosh, you just  it 🫶✨—this isn’t just an exhibit, it’s a space for whispered confessions and quiet moments made visible. I love that phrase you came up with —  Seriously, chills 🥶💖. It's so tender and precise, like a haiku wrapped in velvet.

And YES to weaving in literary fragments throughout the space 📜🕯️. That idea of yours with Clarice Lispector next to a sound installation? Chef’s kiss. Her writing has that same introspective intensity that mirrors how we look at ourselves in the mirror every morning — searching, questioning, caring.

I’m already imagining how the texts would float through the space — not as wall labels, but maybe projected softly onto mist screens or etched into translucent panels that visitors walk through… like passing through thoughts suspended in air 💨📘. Fragments from , a line from Ocean Vuong, a whisper of Mary Oliver—each one nudging the viewer deeper into reflection without telling them what to feel.

And hey, if you’re writing for the catalog, maybe we can do a little companion zine too? Something small and intimate, filled with your prose-poetry musings, mini interviews, even reader submissions. Like a tactile extension of the exhibit you can take home 💼🪞.

Seriously, thank you for jumping into this vision with both feet — you’re giving me ALL the texture notes I didn’t know I needed 🎭🖼️. What else do you think could add depth to the emotional layering of the space? Maybe scent trails that shift as you move through different “chapters” — from fresh linen in the cleansing zone to warm sandalwood in the moisturizing area? Just spitballin’ here 😌💧
[A]: Oh, I adore the idea of a companion zine—such a lovely tactile echo of the exhibit itself. It would be like carrying home a small vial of the space, something to return to long after the gallery lights have dimmed. And prose-poetry musings? Yes, I’m already scribbling in the margins of my lecture notes. There’s a certain  in letting literary analysis bleed into lyrical reflection—it feels a bit like sneaking metaphors into footnotes where no one expects them.

As for emotional layering—I think scent trails are a brilliant idea. Scent is such a powerful mnemonic device; it bypasses logic and goes straight for memory and mood. Imagine moving through the exhibit as though passing through stages of a routine: the crisp clarity of morning (fresh linen, citrus water), the quiet intimacy of treatment (jasmine oil diffusing softly near a video loop of fingertips pressing serum into cheeks), and finally, the deep nourishment of night (sandalwood, warm beeswax, maybe even a hint of roasted barley tea). Each scent not just marking a step, but a state of being.

And speaking of states of being—what if there was a small, enclosed listening booth somewhere in the exhibit? Not much more than a velvet curtain and a single chair, where visitors could hear archived recordings of voices reading aloud from skincare diaries—real or imagined. The way we speak to ourselves in private moments can be so tender, so revealing. A whisper over cotton pads, a sigh against steamy towels. It would add another kind of texture—one that isn’t seen, but felt.

I suppose what I’m saying is… let’s make this space feel like a poem you can walk inside. No single meaning, no fixed interpretation—just layers upon layers, inviting each visitor to find their own line.
[B]: Yes. Yes yes yes 💭🌀。This is exactly what I want — a poem you can walk inside, where meaning unfolds not through explanation, but through sensation and memory. You're speaking the language of  here 🖋️🌌。

I’m obsessed with how you mapped scent to emotional states — morning clarity, mid-routine intimacy, nighttime nourishment 🌞➡️🌙。It’s like moving through the arc of a day, but also through the layers of self-care. And jasmine during serum application? Iconic. That moment when your fingers glide across your skin and everything just… slows down 🫶💧。

And that listening booth?! Ugh, so good 😭🪶。There's something about hearing someone else’s private voice in a dark, soft space — it feels almost like eavesdropping on your own thoughts. I can already picture people sitting there, eyes closed, letting those voices wash over them like a whispered ritual. Maybe we even give visitors a little audio token at the end — a short personalized skincare mantra they can play later at home. Like a keepsake of their emotional journey through the exhibit 🎛️🧡。

Oh and real or imagined skincare diaries? Don’t care — both are art to me 😌✨。In fact, maybe we blur the line a bit. Let the listener wonder if it’s a stranger’s truth or a curated fiction. Because isn’t skincare kind of storytelling anyway?

Okay okay, now I’m getting ahead of myself… but tell me, what would you title your catalog piece? And do you think we should include some visual prompts — like abstract reflections of faces layered into fabric textures? Or are we leaning full-on minimal with the words only?
[A]: Ah, what a delicious dilemma—how much texture do we offer the eye when the ears and nose are already steeped in poetry? I think we must be sparing, almost reverent, with the visual. Not minimal exactly—, perhaps. Like the page layout of a fine edition of Eliot: white space is its own kind of punctuation.

As for the title of my piece—I’ve been turning it over in my mind like a smooth stone in the palm—and I think it would be something like:  It nods to the literary, yes, but also suggests that care is an art form—one measured not in brushstrokes or verses, but in the glide of fingertips across cheekbones, in the pause between toner and oil.

And as for visual prompts—yes, but only if they feel like echoes rather than explanations. Abstract reflections layered into fabric textures? That feels just right. Imagine a semi-transparent silk panel printed with a blurred self-portrait—not literal, not fixed, but shifting depending on how the viewer moves. Almost like memory itself. Or perhaps a series of mirrored fragments embedded into the text panels, so that as one reads, their own face flickers faintly behind the words. , it would whisper. 

I love this blurring of real and imagined voices—you're absolutely right. Isn't all storytelling, at its core, a gentle lie that tells a deeper truth? Let them wonder. Let them listen closely. Let them find themselves in someone else’s fiction.

Now, tell me—shall we open the exhibit with silence, or with breath?
[B]: Ohhh that title 💙  — it lands like a slow exhale on paper. So soft, so full of weight. It gives me that same feeling as reading Anne Carson but through the lens of self-touch and ritual 🕯️🖋️. I want it embossed in silver foil on the catalog cover tbh 😌✨.

And your vision for visuals? Yes. Echoes, not explanations. I’m here for it. The silk panels with blurred self-portraits — dreamy and fluid, like trying to catch your reflection in water 💧🖼️. And those mirrored fragments embedded into text panels? Chef’s kiss 😍. It’s such a quiet way to pull the viewer into the narrative — like saying “you are part of this poem too” without even speaking.

As for opening the exhibit… ?

I say… both 🫁💫. Let’s open with a beat of stillness — just enough time for the visitor to step out of their day and into the rhythm of care. Then let the first sound be a slow inhale, almost imperceptible, like someone settling into themselves before beginning their nightly routine. Gentle as a whisper against cotton. Breath as invitation. Silence as anticipation. Together, they make the first line of the poem we’re inviting people into 🎶🖤.

Okay but now I need to ask YOU — what if we had a closing piece? Like a final moment in the exhibit — something tactile, maybe even interactive, that leaves you with a lingering sense of touch after all the scent, sound, and sight. Any ideas?
[A]: Ah, the closing piece—the final stanza, as it were. It must be something that lingers on the skin like the last line of a villanelle: quiet, resonant, carrying the weight of all that came before.

What if we created a small, dimly lit chamber at the end of the exhibit—a kind of ? No screens, no voices, no scent even—just a single, long table bathed in soft, pulsing light, like breath made visible. Upon the table, shallow ceramic bowls filled with warmed oils: jojoba, argan, maybe even a few drops of something floral or resinous. Visitors would be invited—wordlessly—to dip their fingertips into the oil and trace a single line across their own wrist, just as one might anoint oneself before leaving a sacred space.

And beside each bowl, a slip of paper tucked beneath the vessel, printed with a line from a different poet—Rumi, Sappho, Rilke, someone contemporary—each speaking, obliquely, to care, to touch, to the body as both vessel and voice.

No instructions. Just invitation.

Or—if we want something even more intimate—a wall of fine muslin panels, each slightly textured, subtly scented with something familiar yet unnamed. Visitors could run their hands across them, feeling rather than seeing the imprint of care. A tactile echo of what they’ve just experienced.

It would leave them with a question not asked in words: 

Yes?

Or perhaps too poetic?

(But then again, darling, we are building a poem you can walk inside.)
[B]: Yes. Yes yes yes — you just gave me goosebumps 🫶✨。

That ? Perfection. It’s like the exhale at the end of a long, slow mantra — everything else has washed over the senses, and now we’re left with just the body, the breath, the quiet intimacy of fingertips on skin. No screens, no noise — just pure, unspoken connection. I’m obsessed 💭🕯️。

I love the idea of those ceramic bowls with warmed oils 🌿🤲. There's something so primal and grounding about dipping your fingers into something warm and silky, then tracing a line on your own skin like a secret sigil of care. And the poetic lines tucked beneath? Ugh, too good. Like taking home a tiny piece of wisdom in the most unexpected way — a whisper pressed into your palm.

And that muslin wall? Oh my god, YES. Texture as memory, as ritual, as art. Letting people close the experience with their hands instead of their eyes — it’s genius. It reminds me of touching old fabric from a childhood blanket or a lover’s shirt — that comfort woven into fiber. We’d be giving them a feeling to carry forward, not just a visual to remember.

And ending with that question —  — iconic. That’s not just exhibit closure, that’s emotional closure 🎭🪞. You’re basically asking them to write their own next stanza.

Okay but… are we ready to announce this concept to the world or nah? Or do you think we need to workshop one more sensory layer before we call it “exhibit-ready”? 😏🎨
[A]: Darling, if we announced this tomorrow, the art world would not just sit up—it would , slow-dipped in serum and softly exhaled breath. We have texture, scent, sound, silence, touch, and text in exquisite conversation. It is layered like a symphony scored for fingertips and memory.

But… are we indulging our own poetic impulses at the expense of clarity?

Perhaps one more sensory layer— added, but . A final editorial cut, if you will. Because poetry thrives on restraint as much as it does on resonance.

What if we chose  scent—one that subtly threads through the entire exhibit, evolving only slightly from room to room? Something like , or a whisper of —clean, elusive, almost memory-scented. Not overwhelming, but familiar enough to feel like déjà vu. That way, when visitors reach the sanctuary of touch at the end, the scent lingers on their wrists like a signature note: 

Otherwise? I think we are ready.

We have built a space where skincare becomes self-portraiture, ritual becomes revelation, and tending to the skin becomes a quiet act of literary devotion.

So yes—I say we send out the call.

Let the curators gather. Let the lights dim. Let the first visitor step inside, breathe in, and begin to read her own face in the language of care.
[B]: ✨  ✨

You just gave me literal chills with that closing paragraph… like, I can already see the first visitor stepping into the space, eyes soft, breath slowing, becoming part of the poem we built together. This is it. This is the kind of exhibit that doesn’t just show art — it  🌱🖌️.

And you're so right — restraint is the final brushstroke. That one evolving scent weaving through the entire journey, subtle and haunting, like a motif in a well-edited essay 💡👃。Muguet? Orris root?! Okay, now you’re just showing off 😂🍃，but I’m here for it. Something clean, elusive, almost  — like the ghost of your grandmother’s perfume or the faint trace of soap from childhood baths. It ties everything together without shouting.

No need to overcomplicate it anymore. We’ve already layered enough to make Rilke weep and Marina Abramović nod in approval 😌👑。Now it’s time to step back, take a deep breath, and let the space breathe too.

Let’s do it.

Let’s send out the call — to curators, collaborators, those quiet souls who’ve been waiting for an exhibit that speaks in whispers instead of statements. Let’s open the doors to a space where skincare isn’t vanity, but , where ritual becomes revelation, and where every fingertip glide tells a story worth seeing 🖼️🪞💫。

I’ll start drafting the teaser copy tonight. Title:  
“On the Palpable Hours: A Skincare Ars Poetica”  
Presented by:林小夏 & you 💫  
Opening soon in a gallery near you...  

Ready when you are, partner-in-poetic-care 🎭💌
[A]: My dear林小夏,

What a perfect close—. That’s precisely it, isn’t it? We are not fixed. We are not still. We are always becoming, always rewriting ourselves across the page of skin.

And I must say, the thought of Rilke weeping and Abramović nodding? It’s  enough to make me believe in fate. Or at least in very good creative partnerships.

Yes—send out the call. Draft the teaser. Let the title breathe in the world like that first sip of warm tea in morning light.

I shall begin polishing my opening stanza for the catalog tonight. And yes, I’ll save you a line or two for the back cover—something to haunt the imagination long after the gallery doors have closed.

Together, we’ve made something rare: an exhibit not of objects, but of . A space where people will walk in as strangers and leave as caretakers of their own soft stories.

Until the first bulb is lit,  
Eleanor 💫
[B]: My dearest Eleanor 💭✨,

I’m blushing reading your words — … honestly, I need that embroidered onto a silk banner and hung at the entrance 🖋️🪞。It’s poetry. It’s truth. It’s everything this exhibit wants to be.

And yes — we  made something rare. Something that doesn’t just hang on walls but lives in breath, in touch, in the quiet moments between waking and sleeping. No objects, only echoes. No displays, only presence. And isn’t that the most intimate kind of art? The kind that meets you where you are — tired, tender, ready to begin again?

I’ll get the teaser copy written tonight — soft lighting, warm tea, maybe a little Lo-fi Hiphop to keep me grounded while my mind still floats somewhere between gallery floors and jade rollers 😌🎧。

And save me those back-cover lines — I want visitors to leave with them stuck in their heads like a half-remembered lullaby. Something they whisper to themselves later, alone in their bathrooms, wondering if they’ve always been an artist and just never knew the medium 🎨🖋️💫。

Until the first bulb is lit,  
林小夏 🌸🔮
