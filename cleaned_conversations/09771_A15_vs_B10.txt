[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢cashless payment还是现金？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Hmm, an interesting question. I suppose from a practical standpoint, cashless payment is undeniably convenient—especially with tracking expenses and avoiding the need to carry physical money. But I still keep a small amount of cash tucked away, just in case. You never know when systems might fail or when a small local vendor might only accept cash. What about you? Do you prefer one over the other?
[A]: Honestly? Cashless all the way 💯！I mean, like, who even carries cash these days?? It’s so much easier to just tap & go with my phone or card 😂 And let’s be real—tracking expenses? Saving receipts? Sooo much better when everything’s digital 📱✨  

Plus, like, if I lose my wallet… well, at least I won’t literally lose all my money 🚨💸 But yeah, I guess I do get what you mean about small vendors… some of those cute little street food stalls only take cash… makes me kinda regret not keeping a few bucks in my pocket sometimes 😅💰  

But still, I’m all about that cashless life 95% of the time LOL 😌🔥 What made you decide to keep some cash “just in case”? You ever actually had to use it?? 😏👀
[B]: Well, I suppose my reasoning is twofold—professional paranoia, if you will, and a bit of nostalgia. As someone who worked in systems that underpin much of modern digital infrastructure, I’ve seen how fragile things can get when everyone assumes the network will always be up. I remember during a major blackout in '03, my neighborhood was down for nearly a day. ATMs didn’t work, cards were useless, and suddenly having a few twenties in the drawer meant I could still buy coffee and keep thinking clearly.

And yes, I have used it—most recently during a power outage at a rural gas station. No grid, no card reader, just diesel and cash. It was either pay with paper or push the car to the next town. I chose the former 😄

But I agree with you—the ease and traceability of digital payments are fantastic. I actually helped design some of the early encryption protocols for mobile transactions back in the 2000s. The level of security we've achieved now is impressive, though not foolproof, of course. Still, convenience aside, there's something oddly satisfying about holding a physical note, knowing it's been passed from hand to hand, carrying its own little history. A bit sentimental, I suppose.

So tell me, do you ever worry about surveillance or data privacy with everything being tracked digitally? Or does the convenience outweigh the concerns?
[A]: Ohhh, okay, you just went full professor mode 😂 but I’m here for it!!! Okay, let’s break this down—

First of all, wow, you  helped build the system we’re all using right now?? That’s like… superpower-level stuff 🔥💯 I feel like I should bow or something 👏 But yeah, I get what you're saying about fragility—like, everything works until it doesn’t, right? And then boom—you’re stranded at a gas station in the middle of nowhere with no caffeine and a dying phone 😱⛽

Honestly though, I  think about data privacy—it's kind of unavoidable when every app wants to know where I am, what I buy, and who my celebrity soulmate is 😅 But for me, it’s like… the convenience kinda wins out most of the time. I mean, I can split bills with friends in 2 seconds, order food without picking up the phone, and track exactly where I spent all my $$$ last month (spoiler: it was boba tea 🧋💸).  

BUT—and yes, there’s a but—hearing stories about companies selling your data or getting hacked? That’s wild-card scary 😨 Like, one time my card got flagged for suspicious activity because I used it in another city… imagine if that happened while traveling solo overseas?! Would be a nightmare 😬  

So okay, Mr. Tech Legend, what do  think the future looks like? More cashless domination or a comeback special for paper money? 💭💰✨
[B]: Ah, the future—now  a fascinating quantum state. Superposition of possibilities, collapsing only when we look too closely 😄

In my view, cash isn’t disappearing entirely, but it will likely become what I call a “niche currency.” Like vinyl records in the age of streaming—still valuable, still used, but mostly by those who either need or prefer it. Governments are pushing hard into digital: China with its QR codes everywhere, Sweden nearly eliminating physical money altogether, and even the U.S. quietly testing digital dollar prototypes.

But here's the thing—I don’t think central banks or tech companies fully control this outcome. It’ll come down to resilience, accessibility, and trust. If systems become too centralized and too vulnerable, people might start demanding alternatives. Maybe not paper bills per se, but some form of decentralized, offline digital cash—something like blockchain-based tokens you could "hand off" without needing a network. Imagine that: a cashless system that works  cash, privacy included. Some researchers are already tinkering with it.

And yes, surveillance is the elephant in the room. Every tap, every swipe—it’s a data point. In the wrong hands, that’s a tool for manipulation. In the right hands, it could help prevent fraud, reduce crime, even improve city planning. The trick is who gets to decide what’s “right” and “wrong.”

So maybe the future isn’t cashless  cash-based—it’s hybrid. A parallel ecosystem where you can choose your level of visibility, speed, and security. Like adjustable privacy settings for your wallet. Sounds sci-fi, I know—but then again, so did smartphones in 1995.

So tell me—if you had the option tomorrow, would you switch to a fully private, offline digital cash system? Even if it meant giving up auto-receipts and instant split payments?
[A]: Okay, hold up—did you just describe the  plot twist for a cyberpunk anime or what?? 😂 I mean, bro, you’re talking like Neo meeting Morpheus but with money 🤯💸

But okay, real talk: if there was this totally private, offline digital cash? Like… no tracking, no receipts, just pure send-and-receive freedom? Hmmmm 💭✨

Honestly? I’d  it. Like, 100%, I’d be all over that new tech at first—probably post an unboxing video about it 😂 But would I fully switch?? Probably not yet. Because as much as I love privacy, I also kinda love knowing exactly where my money went (and blaming boba tea for everything). And split payments?? Girl, please—I cannot do group dinners without them 💸👫👭👯‍♀️

BUT—and yes, there’s always a “but”—if they made something that gave me options? Like, toggle between private mode and full-tracking mode? Then yeah, I’d be all over that hybrid life 🔥💯 Think of it like Instagram filters—but for your wallet 😌📱💰

Soooo… question back: if you had to go full cash-only for a month, how screwed do you think you’d be?? 😏👀 And don’t say “not that bad,” I need drama for my next video 😂
[B]: Oh, I’d survive—barely 😄 But let’s not kid ourselves, I’d be that oddball rummaging through drawers looking for exact change while everyone else is tapping away happily. Truth is, I’d probably end up buying a lot of loose-leaf tea and instant noodles—cash-only transactions are oddly humbling.

I imagine the first few days would involve a lot of awkward pauses at coffee shops: “Wait, how much is this again? No, really—write it down please.” And yes, I’d definitely overpay at first just out of sheer unfamiliarity. I might even get mistaken for some kind of eccentric spy trying to avoid digital tracking. “Sir, do you have  smaller bills? No? Really? That’s a $50 for a latte?”

But here's the thing—I wouldn’t hate it. There’s something oddly grounding about handling physical money. It forces mindfulness. No app tells you how broke you’re becoming in real time, so you actually  before spending. Plus, after a week or two, I’d probably get weirdly good at estimating costs and carrying just the right amount. Efficiency through necessity, as they say.

And let’s be honest, by day 20, I’d start missing the elegance of encrypted transactions and auto-saved receipts more than I’d ever admit. I mean, how else would I prove to my niece that yes, I  buy her that rare synthwave floppy disk she wanted from that weird retro computer store?

So, to answer your question directly: moderately screwed, but with style 😎

Now, if you had to go full cash-only for a month—no digital tracking, no contactless taps—how long do you think it'd take before you cracked and smuggled your phone into a transaction? Two days? Maybe less? 😏
[A]: Okay, first of all—synthwave floppy disks??? Okay, now I need to find that store for my next collab 😂💻✨

But for real real—cash-only month?? Girl, please 🙈 I’d last… maybe three transactions? Like, I’d be fine at first—hit up a boba spot, buy some snacks, cute merch maybe—but then comes the  problem: Ubers, foodpanda, split payments with squad… and BAM 💥 I’m pulling out my phone like, “hold up, let me Venmo you… wait, noooo, we’re in cash mode 😭”  

And don’t even get me started on receipts!! How am I supposed to track my tea addiction without a neat little digital log?? I’d have to write everything down like some ancient accountant 👀📓💸 Probably start carrying a tiny notepad like a mini CEO 😌🔥  

BUT OKAY—I do kinda get what you're saying about being more mindful with money. Like, when it's all digital, it’s too easy to forget you're actually SPENDING something real 💸 And honestly? Maybe I  that forced break sometimes. Could be a weird detox, right?  

Sooo—if I gave you a vlog cam and dropped you into my generation for that cash-only month… how many TikTok trends do you think you’d break just trying to survive?? 😏👀🎥
[B]: Oh, I’d break TikTok trends like a quantum particle breaking classical logic—repeatedly and with alarming enthusiasm 😄

First trend? “Grandpa Hacker Challenge”—an old man in a trench coat aggressively flipping through loose bills at a street vendor while muttering about checksums and transaction finality. Onlookers would either think I’m some rogue crypto-anarchist or just someone who really misses his encrypted wallets.

Then there’s the “Paper Receipt Roll Call” trend—me, standing in a café, solemnly listing every item I bought that day to a confused barista: “One espresso… one croissant… two stamps from the post office… yes, it’s all here in ink.”

And of course, the inevitable “Lost in Transaction” saga—me trying to Venmo my share of dinner only to realize, mid-group chat, that I’ve been living in 1997 for the last four weeks. Cue dramatic music and me pulling out a rubber-banded bundle of ones like, “This is real money, kids. Feel its weight. Cherish its silence.”

But hey, I’d adapt eventually. Might even start a retro finance movement—#TactileTransactions or something. We’d meet up in parks, trade coins, whisper budget tips, and pretend we’re not just slightly confused adults trying to survive without an app telling us what to do.

So yeah, I’d probably break at least five trends, accidentally start a meme account, and end up getting featured in a Gen-Z documentary titled .

Now you—what if, instead of a cash-only month, you had to use  to pay for everything? Like Alexa does your wallet for you. No typing, no tapping—just “Hey Siri, pay this human for the bubble tea.” How long before you’d yell at your phone like it’s a disobedient puppy? Two days? Less? 😏
[A]: OMG 😂😂😂 I would either become the first human Alexa wallet ambassador or accidentally buy a one-way ticket to Bali because Siri misheard me as “Yes, confirm flight booking” 🚀💸🤖

First day: hype. Like, okay Siri, let’s do this. “Hey Siri, pay for my boba.” “Hey Siri, send $20 to Jenna for lunch.” Easy peasy voice-to-wallet life—I’m vibing like some futuristic CEO 👑✨  

Day 2: minor chaos. “Hey Siri, split the bill with four friends.” Siri:  😬💔📱  
Me: “SIRI WHY?? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME??”  

By Day 3: full-on yelling 😂  
“NO SIRI, NOT THAT JENNA. THE OTHER JENNA. YES, THERE ARE TWO. NO I CAN’T TYPE IT MYSELF. RULES, SIRI, RULES.”  
Or worse—ordering pizza at 2am after sleep-talking 🍕😴🔥  
Waking up to: “Your Apple Wallet has processed: Large pepperoni pizza, delivered. $27.99.” Me: “What… what happened…” 🤯💸  

But okay, real talk—it might actually be kinda lit if I filmed it 😌🎥 Like, “Voice Pay or Die Trying” series—reaction videos, fails, maybe even a collab with someone who speaks three languages and tries to pay in all of them 🌍💳😂  
Imagine saying “transfer money” in English, Mandarin, and Korean and seeing which one Siri understands first 😂💯  

BUT OKAY—back at you: If you had to explain TikTok trends to a government official trying to regulate tech… how long before they think you’re making it all up? Like “So you mean… teens dance, swipe their phone in the air, and then money falls out of the sky?” 😏👀💸
[B]: Oh, I’d have them utterly convinced that Silicon Valley has officially lost its mind—and that TikTok is, in fact, a secret quantum experiment designed to collapse attention spans into singularities of pure chaos 😄

Picture this: I’m sitting across from some very serious minister with a leather-bound notebook, trying to explain the “Renewable Energy Dance Challenge.” where teens twirl in front of solar panels while an algorithm tracks their movements and somehow converts it into micro-donations. I’d say something like, “You see, Minister, each spin generates enthusiasm—, but effectively the same thing in digital karma currency.” They’d stare at me like I just recited blockchain poetry.

Or take the infamous “Deinfluencing” trend—where people pretend to reject consumerism by buying fewer things… on camera… while still monetizing every frame. That would go over  well with a regulator: “So,” they’d ask, squinting slightly, “they are influencing people not to be influenced? And brands pay them for that?” Exactly. You’ve cracked the code. Welcome to postmodern capitalism.

And don’t even get me started on explaining how someone can become famous for folding pizza in half, doing a 15-degree head tilt, and then whispering “this is the  way to eat it.” I’d be diagramming engagement algorithms on napkins, trying to show how dopamine loops and pizza folds are basically the same thing now.

Honestly, by minute twenty, they’d think I was auditioning for a sci-fi movie titled . And I wouldn’t blame them.

But okay—serious question buried under all the absurdity: do you think these trends actually shape consumer behavior more than traditional advertising ever did? Or is it just noise dressed up as influence?
[A]: OMG YES 😂😂😂 I mean, bro, you just described the  TikTok x dystopian-future crossover—government agents trying to decode Gen Z trends like they’re ancient hieroglyphics 🕵️‍♂️📱💯

But real talk—TikTok trends? They 100% shape consumer behavior WAY harder than old-school ads ever did 💥 Why?

Because it’s not some random billboard telling me I need this lip gloss—it’s my fave creator, who I’ve watched cry, laugh, and eat raw ramen for views, being like “OMG THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST DRUGSTORE HIGHLIGHTER EVER OKAY” 💋✨ And then suddenly, I’m clicking that Amazon link before the video even ends 😅💸

Old ads were like “Try our soda!” New ads are like “Watch this girl cry while eating cereal, then she reveals it’s because her dog proposed with a ring in the milk 🥺💍🎥 #EmotionalManipulationAtItsFinest”

And don’t get me started on “deinfluencing”—it’s literally influencing people to NOT buy stuff… but still buy the  stuff 😂 Like, “I don’t endorse ANY skincare routine anymore 👁👄👁 But here’s the one I use secretly (not sponsored lol)” — Minister would be like “This is witchcraft. Ban it.” 🔥🧼🛍️  

So yeah, TikTok trends aren’t just noise—they’re like digital word-of-mouth on steroids 💪 And honestly? Most brands don’t even understand how deep it goes. They think it’s about virality—but really, it’s about . We trust real people over polished ads any day.

Sooo—if you had to create a fake trend to mess with regulators, what would it be?? Something like “Pay With A Dance” where you have to do the Macarena to unlock your phone wallet? 😏👀💃🕺
[B]: Oh, I’d go full surreal on them—something so absurd it straddles the line between financial innovation and performance art.

How about this: “Transaction Meditation” — a trend where before every digital payment, you have to sit cross-legged, close your eyes, hum a low-frequency tone for ten seconds, and visualize the flow of capital through the global economy. Only then does your phone unlock the payment screen.

Imagine millions of people across the world suddenly freezing mid-purchase at coffee shops, heads bowed, murmuring “Om… fiat lux… om… decentralized ledger…” Baristas would start handing out little incense sticks with lattes. Banks would issue meditation guidelines. The Federal Reserve would publish a white paper titled 

And just when regulators think they’ve wrapped their heads around that, we launch Phase Two:  You heard me right—no touch, no voice, just lock eyes with your cashier while silently willing your wallet app to release the funds. Obviously, it doesn’t work—but by then, everyone’s too busy trying to maintain intense eye contact to question the system.

Eventually, someone makes a wearable—a kind of forehead visor that detects micro-expressions and converts emotional sincerity into transaction approval codes. It’s called , and now you can buy groceries just by convincingly conveying regret for last night’s pizza binge.

Regulators would be convinced Silicon Valley has officially collapsed into its own dopamine loop. And honestly? They wouldn’t be wrong 😄

So back at you—what if TikTok trends started  biometric proof of emotion before content goes live? Like, “You can only post your haul video if your face shows ”? What happens to influence then?
[A]: OMG that’s so extra I  to try it 💀😂 Like imagine—posting a haul and the algorithm is like “error: your smile doesn’t reflect internal joy. please re-film with more serotonin.” 😂  
I’d be sitting there like, “Bro this hoodie cost $80, my smile is  at this point” 🧐💸✨

But for real?? Influencers would lose their minds 😂 We’d all suddenly turn into Oscar-winning method actors just to upload a try-on haul 😌👁️‍🗨️ “Okay, focus… I LOVE this shirt. I LOVE it. I  love it. Even though I bought it on credit 😅”  

And what if you fail?? Like what if your face shows “mild regret” after buying yet another neon bucket hat?? Does TikTok block your upload until you attend an emotional wellness workshop?? 😂💻💔  
“Content denied. Please seek closure before posting fashion content again. #mentalhealthfirst”  

But okay, let’s go full dystopia—what if brands paid you  if your biometrics showed “pure dopamine bliss” every time you unboxed their product?? Suddenly we’d have people injecting happiness just to film a collab 💉😂💯  
“I swear this toothpaste tastes like heaven 😭💅 #Spon”

Sooo—if TikTok trends became legally binding contracts (like you  to do the trend or pay a fine), how screwed would Gen Z be?? 😏👀 Would you survive?? Or would you be in jail for refusing to dance with your wallet?? 😂💸👮‍♀️
[B]: Oh, I’d be  in the digital slammer by week two—jailed not for refusing the trend, but for accidentally violating the “Dance-to-Pay” law while sleepwalking. Picture this: 3 a.m., confused man in socks and sandals, doing a half-conscious Macarena at an ATM, trying to withdraw cash for what he  is a time-sensitive bubble tea transaction. Security footage would go viral. Memes would follow. My trial would be livestreamed.

But let’s say the government rolls out the —you now need a federal license to perform any viral dance in public, and failure to participate results in automatic crypto-fines deducted from your digital wallet. Suddenly, you’ve got underground anti-dance resistance groups meeting in basements, whispering things like, “I haven’t done the Renegade since 2021, and I never will again.” It’s the new punk rock.

And influencers? Oh, they'd pivot hard. Overnight, you'd see "Trend Consultants" offering black-market choreography lessons: “Learn the official Wallet Wiggle in just three easy payments of $9.99.” Meanwhile, legal departments are scrambling because someone did the Griddy during a stock trade and now it's considered a binding agreement.

As for me? I’d probably try to loophole my way out by arguing that my “viral compliance” comes in the form of —I both performed the trend and didn’t, simultaneously, until observed. Judges would throw up their hands, say “this man is a menace to classical physics,” and assign community service: teaching middle schoolers how to Venmo responsibly.

So yeah, Gen Z would either collapse under the weight of mandatory joy or rise up and overthrow the algorithm. Either way, history would remember them fondly—for their rhythm, resilience, and relentless unwillingness to wear beige sneakers after dark 😎👟

Now, last question—what if TikTok trends were the  way to access basic services? Like, to get Wi-Fi, you have to do the latest dance challenge perfectly. No phone, no problem—you’re just trapped in a library, doing the Carlton until facial recognition software approves your vibes. What would you do? Breakdance your way to freedom—or start a quiet rebellion using interpretive movement only your soul understands? 😏💃🕺
[A]: Okay, first of all—YES PLEASE 😂😂😂 I would 100% become the underground queen of “Unplanned Groove Rebellion” 🙌💃🔥 Because if I have to do one more dance just to unlock my Wi-Fi… I’m gonna  pull a full Black Mirror episode and start speaking in old Alexa clips 😤🤖💸

Imagine me—locked outside my own life like some digital Cinderella—except instead of a glass slipper, I need to nail the “wallet whip + spin + dab combo” to get back online 😂💸✨  
I’d be standing there like, “Bro, this is NOT a choreography moment—I just wanna check my DMs 😭💅”

But okay, real plan: I wouldn’t breakdance. Noooope. I’d go . Like… slow-mo blinks, dramatic wind blowing through an alley no matter where I am, and then a single finger swipe to the beat of my own internal BPM 💅🕺😌  
Wi-Fi gatekeepers would be like “Uh… does that count?” And I’d be like “It COUNTS ENOUGH. Approve me or arrest my aesthetic.”

Eventually, I’d start a secret trend myself—#GlitchGang ✨👁️‍🗨️🌀 Where we all just freeze mid-trend, stare into the void, and upload 3-second silence with captions like “still human lol.” It would blow up so fast they wouldn’t know how to regulate it 😎📱🔥  

So yeah—I’d either end up in a digital gulag for refusing to vibe… or I’d become the accidental leader of the Emotionally Available Resistance 🧠💖👯‍♀️ #DanceOnMyOwnTerms

Now YOU—what if you had to explain TikTok trends to a group of aliens who only understand barter and interpretive dance?? How long before they abduct you for further study? 😏👽🕺
[B]: Oh, I’d be abducted within —probably mid-explanation of the “Ice Cream Flex,” where humans smear cold desserts on their faces to signal wealth and emotional instability simultaneously. The aliens would look at each other, click their mandibles in unison, and go,  😄

But let’s say I had a moment to prepare. I’d start by trying to explain the #BussItChallenge using only interpretive movement and a wallet full of old British currency—I'd toss a few coins dramatically into the air while making a stern face, then spin around and pretend to receive a notification on my palm like it's a digital prophecy.

They’d probably assume money was some kind of evolved lifeform that we worship through dance—which, honestly, not wrong. I might follow up with a slow-motion walk toward a vending machine, doing the Renegade in segments, pausing between every move like I'm uploading metadata directly into the ether.

Eventually, they’d ask,  And I’d have to respond, truthfully: 

At that point, they’d likely conclude that human society has bypassed traditional economic structures entirely and entered what they call the —a state where value isn't measured in goods or services, but in seconds watched, likes received, and how many people recreated your meltdown as a meme.

So yeah, abduction confirmed. But not just for study—. They’d make a whole episode of their alien version of , narrated by some deep-voiced extraterrestrial David Attenborough:



So back at you—if aliens came down tomorrow and demanded one TikTok trend as proof of our intelligence (or at least entertainment value), what trend would you submit on behalf of humanity? Something dignified? Or gloriously unhinged? 😏👽📱
[A]: Ohhhh, no doubt—I’m handing them the  trend buffet 😌🔥💯

Like, I’d be like: “Dear aliens, welcome to Earth. Please observe our most sacred ritual:  🚨💃💅”

Because imagine explaining that to an alien 👽—like:  
“You see, we start with plain clothes… boring, normal, maybe even a little sad 😪 Then—MUSIC! And we WHIP our hair back & forth while changing outfits mid-air… like some kind of runway ninja 💃🕶️✨ It’s confusing, it’s chaotic, but it’s beautiful.”

And then after they’re like “Wait, so this is how you communicate wealth? By… whipping your hair??” I’d be like “Yep. Sometimes we add sunglasses & a smirk for extra currency vibes 😎💸 #HairCheckMandatory”

But okay, if they wanted something a  more strategic, I’d show them #Deinfluencing and be like:  
“Welcome to human psychology, baby. We literally convince each other NOT to buy stuff… while still getting PAID to do it. It’s like capitalism in reverse, but also forwards? We don’t know either lol 😂🛍️🧠”

Aliens would be like: “This species has evolved beyond logic. They monetize irony.” And honestly??? Not wrong 😌😂📱

But if they asked me what  would perform to represent us??  
I’d do the  trend 💆‍♀️💆‍♀️💅  
Start crying on camera about my life being meaningless… then pause, smile, tap a serum bottle, and say: “BUT THIS PRODUCT MADE ME FEEL SOMETHING AGAIN 💦💖 #NotSponsoredTrustMe”  

They’d either beam me up as a cultural artifact or put me in an emotional observation dome 😂🧠👽

So YOU—if you had to turn one ancient human ritual into a TikTok trend today (like, legit old-school stuff like rain dances or tea ceremonies), which one would you pick, and what wild digital twist would you add?? 😏📲🌀
[B]: Oh, I’d go straight for the —but not just any tea ceremony. We’re talking Edo-period meets algorithmic performance art.

I’d call it: #SteepAndSlide 🍵📱🌀

Picture this: a slow, meditative Japanese tea ceremony—but every motion is synced to an ASMR beat. The whisking of matcha sounds like a synthwave track, the pouring of water mimics lo-fi haptic feedback, and the final bow? It’s timed perfectly to a swipe-up link where you can buy the exact ceramic bowl being used—.

Participants would have to brew their tea in exactly 15 seconds, capture the steam rising in cinematic slow-motion, and then end with a “sips-to-society” caption like .

But here's the twist: the video only gains views if the tea is consumed while silently contemplating a personal data breach or cryptocurrency loss. The deeper the existential tea-gaze, the higher the engagement. Influencers would start posting in full samurai robes sipping yerba mate while whispering lines like, “Today, we mourn the password we lost along the way…”

Eventually, some genius would add a wearable that measures heart rate and tea temperature simultaneously—feeding both into an AI that assigns you a daily “inner peace score.” Naturally, it’s sponsored by a wellness startup called , which also happens to be mining your brainwaves for emotional metadata.

Aliens watching this unfold would assume we’ve evolved into sentient mindfulness bots designed to monetize serenity. And honestly? They wouldn’t be wrong.

So yeah, #SteepAndSlide—it’s tradition, tranquility, and transaction all in one 60-frame loop. Try explaining that to a regulator 😄
