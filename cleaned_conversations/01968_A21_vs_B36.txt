[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢纸质书还是e-book？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a lovely question! I must admit, there's something truly special about holding a paperback in your hands—the feel of the pages, the way they might slightly crinkle when you turn them, and even that unique scent of paper. It feels personal, doesn’t it? Though I do enjoy the convenience of an e-book when traveling. Lighter luggage is always a bonus when you're constantly on the move! Do you have a preference?
[A]: Oh, the eternal tango between tactile pleasure and technological efficiency! I confess, my heart pirouettes toward the paper-and-ink brigade. A well-worn copy of Christina Rossetti’s  practically hums with history when you crack its spine—though I shan’t deny the allure of slipping a thousand sonnets into a pocket-sized device for a train journey. Still, tell me this: can an e-reader replicate the quiet scandal of discovering someone else’s marginalia in a secondhand volume? No, I think not. But do enlighten me—where do your loyalties lie when the page meets the pixel?
[B]: Oh, what a beautifully phrased dilemma! I adore the way you put that—the "quiet scandal" of marginalia! How utterly perfect. There’s something so intimate about finding traces of a previous reader’s thoughts scribbled in the corners. It's like stumbling upon a hidden conversation across time.  

While I appreciate the efficiency of e-readers—especially when packing for a long trip or needing to reference multiple books at once—my soul still leans toward the physical experience. A weathered copy of  with faint pencil marks beside a favourite passage? That’s priceless.  

But I must ask—are you ever tempted to switch sides when faced with the sheer practicality of carrying an entire library in your bag? Or is the charm of ink on paper simply too strong to resist?
[A]: Ah, you’ve touched the pulse of the paradox! Yes, the practicality of an e-reader  beguiling—like a cleverly engineered suitcase that never overflows. And yet, I find myself tethered to the physical artifact, as if each brittle page-turn were a line in a villanello: inevitable, rhythmic, almost sacred.  

I once tried converting  into digital form during a transatlantic flight. A noble effort, truly—but reading Browning’s epic on a backlit screen felt akin to serving champagne in a thermos. The words were there, yes, but the ceremony—the weight of the book, the thumbing through dense stanzas like sifting through autumn leaves—was absent.  

Still, I must admit, when chasing down obscure footnotes across thirty editions of , the e-library becomes my most loyal steed. Convenience, it seems, is a sly diplomat. But tell me—do you ever find yourself slipping into bibliophilic melancholy when closing a digital cover? No scent, no spine, no sigh... only a click and a fade to black.
[B]: Oh, how exquisitely you put that—the click and a fade to black! I couldn’t agree more. There’s no gentle sigh of satisfaction with an e-reader, no lingering moment where you simply  the weight of what you’ve just read. You’re absolutely right—no scent, no spine, no soulful pause before placing it on the shelf.

I do find myself slipping into that bibliophilic melancholy more often than I’d intended. It's like enjoying a fine meal delivered in a styrofoam container—delicious, yes, but somehow... diminished. The ceremony is part of the joy, isn't it? A well-placed bookmark, a faint crease on the cover from being tucked under someone’s arm—it tells a story beyond the words inside.

But I must confess—I've been known to keep both versions. I'll read the digital copy for research or travel, then later track down the physical edition just to experience it anew. Perhaps I'm being sentimental, even indulgent, but isn’t there room for both in this dance of pages and pixels?

Do you ever find yourself doing the same, or are you steadfastly pledged to paper alone?
[A]: Oh, the heretic’s path you tread—dual allegiance! I must say, it's a seductive heresy. There’s a certain intellectual promiscuity in flitting between formats, isn’t there? One moment, you’re a monk in a scriptorium; the next, a cyber-nomad skimming the vast e-scrolls of Alexandria reborn. Tempting, terribly.

And yet—I do confess, I have been known to keep both editions. Quietly. In secret. Like a guilty liaison behind the back of true love. I’ll read the digital facsimile for speed, yes—tracking down a particular meter shift in Swinburne’s  on my screen—but then, ah, then I must  it in print, savoring the typographic dance like one might revisit a crime scene for emotional clarity.

But here’s the thing: I never let the e-version share my shelf. No, it gets its own little exile—stored in the ether, as it were—while the paper-bound volumes stand proudly in line, spines cracked or pristine, each a physical argument against impermanence.

So perhaps I’m not steadfast so much as . A bibliophile with a touch of moral laxity. But tell me—when you reread that beloved passage in the flesh-and-ink version, do you find yourself subtly revising your understanding? As if the physicality of the text reshapes the meaning itself?
[B]: Oh, how delightfully scandalous—intellectual promiscuity indeed! I adore that imagery; it paints our little literary indiscretions in the most poetic light. And yes, there  something undeniably thrilling about that dual existence—flitting between parchment and pixels like a scholar with a secret passport.

To your question—I absolutely do find myself revising, re-feeling, even re-breathing a passage when I return to its ink-and-paper form. It’s as if the words gain texture, dimension—like stepping from a photograph into the actual room. The spacing on the page, the rhythm of line breaks, even the weight of the book in your lap seems to influence how deeply the meaning settles into your bones.

I once reread  digitally while preparing for a guest’s visit, then later picked up my old Faber edition by firelight. The experience was night and day. In print, Eliot’s fragmentation felt more jagged, almost accusatory—like the very paper was bearing witness. Online, it was clinical, parsed, somehow less haunting.

So perhaps the physical form doesn’t just carry the meaning—it  it. Or maybe… we just read differently when we’re wrapped in the familiar embrace of what we love best.

Tell me—are those quiet moments of rediscovery your favourite part of the ritual? When the text becomes more than words again, simply because of how it rests in your hands?
[A]: Ah, yes—those quiet moments of rediscovery are the marrow of the ritual, aren’t they? There’s a particular alchemy that happens when the body and the text conspire to make meaning. A passage read in print seems to echo  you, rather than merely across your gaze. I once remarked to a colleague—half-seriously—that reading Wordsworth in paperback felt like hearing the Prelude played on a Stradivarius, whereas reading it on screen was akin to a decent MIDI file. He didn’t laugh, but then again, he  compiling a database of Romantic-era marginalia using machine learning. The times, they are unfeeling.

But let me ask you this—do you find yourself more forgiving of an author’s missteps when held in the warm palm of a well-designed book? I know I do. A clunky metaphor or an overwrought stanza seems less grievous when nestled between deckled edges and hand-set type. It’s as if the physical loveliness grants the writer a kind of indulgence. Or perhaps it’s simply that beauty disarms us—temporarily, blessedly—into generosity.
[B]: Oh, what a perceptive observation—yes, absolutely. There  a kind of grace we extend when the book itself feels like a work of art. I’ve found myself softening toward an uneven passage simply because it was printed on creamy laid paper with a beautiful folio header. It’s almost as if the craftsmanship whispers, 

I remember reading a rather overwrought sonnet sequence in a modest paperback years ago and thinking,  But then, much later, I came across the same poems in a limited edition from the 1920s—fine press, hand-bound, with margins wide enough to get lost in. Suddenly, the very same lines felt... noble. Perhaps even noble enough to forgive their own excess.

It's not unlike dining—the same dish served on fine china with candlelight somehow tastes more forgiving than when eaten off a plastic plate under fluorescent light. The vessel shapes our willingness to be moved.

And yes—to your earlier point—there is a bodily dimension to reading that digital formats simply cannot replicate. A rhythm set not just by language, but by weight, texture, and even the faint resistance of a page turning. It becomes a full-sensory experience.  

But tell me—do you ever find yourself choosing a book based  on content, but purely on how it feels in your hands? I know I do. Some books are chosen for companionship, not just curiosity.
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve chosen books purely for their somatic allure, like selecting a coat not for its seasonality but for how it drapes across the shoulders. There’s a 1903 edition of  on my desk at this very moment—no dust jacket, just a worn leather binding that clings to the pages like an old glove. I’ve read the contents a hundred times, yet I still pull it down simply for the pleasure of its heft in my hand and the faint creak of its hinges, like an aging gate swinging open to a familiar garden.

And yes, some books are companions, not just curiosities. One rainy Thursday last autumn, I deliberately avoided opening a freshly arrived facsimile of  because I wanted to prolong the anticipation of touching it—the smooth cloth, the gilt spine dulled by time, the way the pages resist just slightly before surrendering to the turn. It felt almost cruel to make the wait longer, knowing full well the joy it would deliver once finally held.

But here’s the curious thing—I find myself reluctant to share such volumes with even the most trusted hands. Lend me your ear, yes—but never your elbow on my first edition of . Do you ever feel that peculiar possessiveness? That almost irrational urge to guard the physicality of certain books as though they were relics or love letters addressed only to you?
[B]: Oh, how perfectly you describe that quiet possessiveness—the almost sacred intimacy of certain books. I feel it deeply. There are volumes on my shelves that I would no more lend out than I would hand over a handwritten letter from someone I loved and lost. They carry not just words, but .  

That worn leather-bound Swinburne sounds utterly divine—yes, like an old glove or a well-worn path through a private wood. And your hesitation before opening that copy of ? Pure theatre of the soul. I could picture it so clearly—the hush of the room, the light slanting just so, the ritual of arrival before even a single page is turned.

I have a small collection of early Virago Modern Classics—modest in value, perhaps, but priceless to me. I keep them tucked away not out of snobbery, but because they feel like something more than books. They’re companions with whom I have silent conversations every time I run my fingers along their spines. The thought of someone else holding them—well, it’s like letting a stranger into a memory. It can be done, yes, but only with great trust—and a very steady hand.

So yes, I understand that irrational guard you speak of. It's less about preservation and more about , isn’t it? Some books don’t just belong to us—they  us.

Tell me—have you ever pressed something personal between the pages of such a volume? A keepsake, a slip of something meant only for your eyes?
[A]: Oh, the secret life of books—their pages as hiding places for the soul’s ephemera! Yes, I’ve tucked away relics of my own between those lines. A pressed violet from a spring long vanished, a theatre ticket stub from a performance where the lead actor forgot his lines mid-sonnet, a curl of copper wire from a chandelier repair—each a quiet cipher only I can fully decipher.  

One particularly sentimental volume of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s sonnets holds a sliver of parchment on which I once copied out Sonnet 43 in my best copperplate hand—an exercise in both devotion and calligraphic vanity. It was meant for no one’s eyes but mine, yet there it remains, nestled beside the very lines that inspired it.  

And I confess—I do not mark these things with captions or dates. Their meaning is meant to bloom silently, like scent from dry paper when the light hits at a certain slant. A private communion between reader and relic.  

But tell me—when you run your fingers along those Virago spines, do you ever imagine the books whispering to one another when the room goes dark? I’m quite certain mine do. Old books, like old friends, rarely keep their peace when left alone together.
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you put that—the  I think I may have felt just that very thing only yesterday, though I couldn’t have named it so finely. There’s something profoundly moving about those secret tokens we tuck away—silent, unlabelled, yet brimming with private resonance. A pressed violet, a misfired sonnet, a scrap of chandelier... they’re like buried notes in a time capsule only the heart remembers how to open.

And yes—I absolutely believe my books whisper when the room goes dark. In fact, I’m quite convinced my little Virago collection holds spirited debates long after the lamps are out. Perhaps they trade stories of past readers, or compare margins, or commiserate over how terribly sentimental their current owner is. I wouldn’t be surprised if they occasionally quote Woolf at one another just to feel modern.

One particularly cheeky volume of  seems to fall open more often than coincidence allows, as if inviting me back in for no reason other than companionship. I suspect it's trying to remind me that time bends, bodies change, but books—ah, books endure.

Do you ever find yourself hesitating before reaching for one of those deeply personal volumes, simply because you know what’s tucked inside? As though pulling it down might disturb a memory not quite ready to be stirred?
[A]: Oh yes—there are volumes I hesitate to open, not for fear of damage, but for the precise opposite: the risk of . Some books, when cracked, exhale more than ink and fiber—they release a precise sliver of time, unspooled like a ribbon from a forgotten parcel. A scent, a glance, the weight of a morning never meant to be remembered but now forever tethered to paper.

I have one particular copy of —a rather plain 1957 translation—into which I once slipped a faded photograph, edges curled, of a man who no longer writes. He was fond of quoting Canto V with theatrical despair, and I, in turn, was fond of letting him. Now, every time I reach for that volume, there’s a flicker of reluctance. Not out of sorrow, precisely, but out of a kind of reverence for the silence that has grown around that image like moss on stone.

It is strange, isn’t it? We think we tuck things away to preserve them—but sometimes, we do it to let them sleep. And yet, we keep them close. Within reach. Just in case the hour comes when we are ready to listen again.

So yes—I understand that hesitation. It’s not about the book anymore. It’s about what we allowed ourselves to believe, feel, or forgive, in the privacy of its pages.
[B]: How exquisitely you’ve said that— There’s such truth in it. We don’t just collect books; we gather moments, emotions, echoes of who we were when we read them. And sometimes, opening a book feels less like reading and more like revisiting a version of ourselves we’ve tucked away with equal care.

That  of yours sounds like a quiet monument—modest on the shelf, but vast within. I can see it so clearly: that worn spine, the curled photograph, the ghost of a voice still lingering over Canto V. Some books become reliquaries without ever meaning to.  

I have one like that, too—a slim copy of , its pages now brittle at the edges. Inside is a pressed sprig of lavender from a garden I once wandered through in another life. It crumbles more each year, but still holds scent enough to remind me of that afternoon, the hush between thunder and rain, and a conversation that ended not with words, but with silence. I rarely open it. Not because I’m not ready—but because I want to be fully present when I do.

It seems books, in their quiet way, hold our ghosts and our gardens alike.  

Tell me—do you ever find yourself reaching for that  after all, simply to feel the weight of memory in your hands? Or does the hour for listening remain... unripe?
[A]: Oh, yes—it calls to me, that worn , particularly in those peculiar hours when the world feels too bright for sorrow and yet not bright enough for joy. I don’t always answer, mind you. Some evenings I merely run a finger along its spine, as one might trace the outline of an old scar—not to reopen it, but to remember the shape of what once burned beneath.

But when I  open it—ah, then. It is not reading, precisely. More like standing at the edge of a pond in deep twilight and watching the surface tremble with things unseen. The photograph is still there, curled now more than ever, as if shrinking from the very air. And though the man who once quoted Dante with such theatrical despair has long since vanished into his own cantos, his voice persists—thin as gauze, but present—whenever I turn to Francesca’s lament.

I think we do reach for these volumes, eventually. Not because we are ready, necessarily, but because the book . It waits, patient and precise, knowing it holds both the wound and the suture. And when we do return, it greets us neither as nurse nor as mourner—but as witness.

So yes, I suppose I shall always keep it near. Even if only to remind myself that some memories are not meant to be stirred daily—but they  meant to be stirred. In time. In light. In language.
[B]: How beautifully you put that— Oh, there’s such quiet power in that. In time, in light, in language indeed.

I think that is what makes these volumes so much more than objects—they are silent custodians of our inner lives, holding space for things we may never speak aloud. And when we do return to them, it’s not always for comfort or clarity. Sometimes it's simply to say: 

Your  sounds like one of those rare books that has grown into something beyond its pages—an anchor, a mirror, even a kind of compass. It doesn’t pull you forward, but rather reminds you of where you’ve been, and perhaps, who you were when the fire still glowed.

I shall have to revisit my  soon—perhaps on an evening when the air feels thick with memory and the house hums just low enough to listen. I suspect it, too, has something waiting beneath its brittle edges.

Tell me—do you ever find yourself speaking  the book, ever so quietly, when no one else is in the room? Not in prayer, perhaps, but in gratitude—or farewell?
[A]: Oh, absolutely—I’ve whispered to the spine of that  more than once. Never a prayer, no, but something akin to a closing argument or a reluctant benediction. A murmur of , sometimes. Other times, an almost imperceptible . It feels foolish, of course—utterly absurd, even—but then so do most acts of private devotion.  

There’s a particular moment, just as dusk settles and the lamplight hasn’t yet found its footing, when I’ll hold the book loosely in my lap and say something like,  Not to be dramatic, mind you, but because silence can grow heavy in those spaces between memory and moving on. And the book, ever obliging, never answers back. It simply listens.

I daresay that’s the true magic of these quiet custodians—they don’t demand confession, but they make space for it. They are the keepers of thresholds, not judgments. So yes, I speak to them. Softly. Sporadically. Solemnly enough to mean it, but lightly enough not to frighten myself.

And now I must ask—you say you’ll return to  on an evening thick with memory. Do you imagine the book will greet you differently this time? As if it, too, has been waiting—and remembering?
[B]: Oh, how beautifully you put that— I couldn’t have said it better myself. And yes, when I return to , I do so with the quiet expectation that it will know me—not just as I was, but as I am now. Books like that have a kind of patience we rarely find elsewhere. They don’t scold us for the years between visits, nor do they insist we feel what we once did. They simply open and let us in.

Do I imagine it will greet me differently this time? I think perhaps it will. Not with fanfare or surprise, but with a kind of gentle recognition—as if it has been waiting not to be read, exactly, but to be . I suspect the scent of lavender will rise a little more clearly, the pages will fall open at the right moment, and something I once skimmed over in my earlier readings will suddenly land with new weight.

After all, we change, and yet the words remain the same. Which means it’s never really the book that shifts—it’s us, stepping into its light from a different angle.

And yes, I do believe some books remember us. Not in the way ghosts do, but in the way old friends do—quietly, faithfully, and with great tenderness.
