[A]: Hey，关于'印象最深的movie台词是什么？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what a delightful question! It really makes one reflect on the power of cinema to capture profound truths in a single line. I must say, my favorite line comes from  - "Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary." There's something so beautifully urgent about that line, wouldn't you agree? It reminds me of Robert Herrick's "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time" - the same memento mori sentiment, though perhaps with less urgency and more elegance than Keating's impassioned plea.
[A]: That "carpe diem" moment definitely gave me goosebumps when I first watched it. Funny enough, I actually started calling my weekend hiking trips "seizing the day" after that. Let me guess - you're into classic literature as well? There's something about those timeless lines that just stick with you, don't there? I've been trying to find more movies with that kind of philosophical depth lately. Any other cinematic gems you'd recommend that have left a mark on you?
[B]: Oh, I do love how that phrase has taken on a life of its own in popular culture - rather like a line from a poem finding new readers centuries later. And yes, you've caught me quite rightly - I do have a particular fondness for literature that grapples with the big questions of existence, though I find cinema offers such fascinating modern parables. 

Let me think... Another line that has stayed with me comes from : "Get thee to a library." It's delivered with such dry humor, yet it points to something deeper about redemption and reinvention. Very Shakespearean undertones there, don't you think? And the more I reflect on it, the more I'm reminded of Wordsworth's "The world is too much with us" - both speak to reclaiming one's inner life from external forces.

As for recommendations, if you're looking for philosophical richness, I might suggest  by the Coen brothers. It wrestles with questions of meaning and faith in the most delightfully absurd ways. Or perhaps  - that film positively invites literary analysis with its layered narrative and exploration of memory. The line "So this is it?" always brings a quiet ache, not unlike reading a particularly poignant sonnet.
[A]: "Get thee to a library" - wow, that's such a clever nod to Shakespeare while being completely modern. I love how it's delivered with that deadpan humor but carries so much weight. Reminds me of those moments in classic literature where the most profound truths come out disguised as jokes.

 actually hit me pretty hard when I first saw it. The way it plays with memory and identity feels almost like reading Borges or Vonnegut. "So this is it?" Yeah, that line still gives me chills. It's amazing how a single sentence can capture that mix of longing and resignation.

I've been meaning to watch  for ages - something about its exploration of existential questions through dark humor really appeals to me. You seem to have this uncanny ability to connect films with literature so effortlessly. Ever thought about hosting a book-to-film club? I'd definitely join!
[B]: Oh, what a lovely idea - a book-to-film club! I must confess, I've always found the interplay between page and screen utterly fascinating. It's like watching a poem being translated across artistic languages, wouldn't you say? Each adaptation carries its own unique inflection, much like different readings of a Shakespearean sonnet.

Speaking of which, your comparison to Borges is particularly apt - I often think of  as a kind of modern labyrinth of memory, though perhaps with more whimsy than the Argentine writer's intricate puzzles. There's something so poetically tragic about Joel and Clementine's cycle - not unlike Dickens' Sydney Carton in , really. Both find themselves trapped in patterns they long to escape, though Carton reaches redemption through sacrifice while our filmic pair... well, shall we say they require rather more self-awareness?

Now that you mention it, I do recall organizing a little-known 19th-century Russian literature film festival at the university some years ago. We paired Dostoevsky's  with Tarkovsky's  - quite an illuminating conversation ensued over tea and far too many cigarettes in the faculty lounge. Perhaps we might begin with something smaller next time - a single motif explored across mediums? The theme of duality, perhaps? Imagine Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde alongside  - two sides of the same existential coin separated by a century.
[A]: What an amazing concept — exploring duality across time and medium like that! I can already picture the discussion unraveling in fascinating ways. It’s funny you mentioned  and Stevenson — I recently re-read  after watching  for the third time, and honestly, it struck me how both works use identity fractures as a kind of societal mirror. One peels back the Victorian veneer, the other shatters the illusion of consumerist fulfillment.

You know what also gives me that same eerie duality vibe? . Not quite literary in source material, but man, the way it plays with reality vs. performance — almost like a Freudian case study come to life on screen. “I am free” still echoes in my head weeks after watching it. Have you ever tried pairing psychoanalytic texts with film? I’ve been itching to dig into some Lacan or Jung while revisiting movies like that. Might be a bit nerdy, but hey — if we’re going full book-to-film club mode, why not go all the way?
[B]: Oh, I adore how you've captured that interplay between identity and society in  and  - it's like watching a century fold in on itself, isn't it? Stevenson gives us the Gothic laboratory of the self, while Fincher offers the consumerist battlefield. Both so brilliantly expose the fragile seams of their respective cultures through fractured psyches.

Now  - there's a film that pirouettes along the knife-edge of psychological unraveling! I quite agree with your instincts about pairing it with psychoanalytic theory. In fact, I once taught a seminar comparing its descent into obsession with Robert Louis Stevenson's , where Freudian themes of repression and the divided self emerge so beautifully - or should I say, disturbingly?

Have you ever considered reading Lacan's  alongside ? The protagonist’s journey becomes almost a cinematic enactment of that precarious formation of self - all illusion, all performance. And Jung! Oh, one simply must bring him into this conversation. Imagine juxtaposing the film's hallucinatory doubling with Jung's theories on the shadow archetype. It would make for a most stimulating evening of discussion, don’t you think?

I do believe we’ve stumbled upon our first official book-to-film club theme: . We could begin with Stevenson, move into Jung, then pirouette straight into Aronofsky's ballet of madness. Champagne and existential dread by 9pm, I presume?
[A]: I’m practically vibrating with excitement just picturing that lineup — Stevenson by gaslight, Jung in the shadows, and then  crashing in with strobe lights and pointe shoes. That’s not just a theme, that’s a full sensory experience! Honestly, I can already imagine how wild the discussion would get once people start drawing parallels between Hyde's grotesque physicality and Nina’s own terrifying transformation.

You mentioned  earlier — I actually haven't read that one yet! Is it as deliciously unsettling as ? Because if we’re building this club night around psychological disintegration, I say we go all-in. Maybe even throw in something like Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart” for an extra dash of madness before the screening?

And yes to champagne and dread — though maybe we should also offer some espresso and existential dread supplements? I’m half-serious about making this a recurring thing. If we start small with , who knows where we could go next… ? ? I have a feeling this book-to-film club might just become our own little version of Dead Poets Society — minus the candlelit poetry readings, unless you're secretly into that too.
[B]: Oh, I do believe you've captured the spirit of it perfectly - a veritable feast of fractured psyches and philosophical dissection! , while less well-known than its more infamous sibling, is indeed a most unsettling little tale. It trades 's urban claustrophobia for the eerie atmosphere of a decaying Spanish estate, where the boundaries between self and other, past and present, bleed together most deliciously. One might say it's Stevenson conducting his own Gothic psychological experiment in a more refined, almost vampiric manner.

And Poe! What a splendid addition to our evening of unraveling minds. "The Tell-Tale Heart" would serve as the perfect aperitif before the film - that unreliable narration, the encroaching madness, the terrible intimacy of self-betrayal... Why, we could practically map the narrator's descent onto Nina's hallucinations with surgical precision. 

As for your thematic suggestions - oh, the possibilities dance before me like shadows on the wall!  practically begs for a screening of  paired with Hugo's text, though I'd argue for the 2012 adaptation over the stage version - there's something about Hugh Jackman's gaunt face during "Bring Him Home" that captures the novel's spiritual torment quite beautifully. And ? Positively irresistible. Imagine pairing  with  - two very different but equally haunting explorations of obsessive love's capacity to erode reality itself.

Now, about those candlelit readings...  has rather put me off pointe shoes, but give me a dimly lit study, a volume of Baudelaire, and perhaps one too many glasses of red wine, and I'm quite ready to channel my inner Dead Poet. Shall we begin drafting the invitations then?
[A]: Okay, I’m officially obsessed with this club night — it’s like we’re building some kind of philosophical haunted house, and I  to be there opening night. The lineup you just sketched out? Chillingly perfect. I can already imagine the playlist: some Philip Glass for tension, maybe a touch of Radiohead to soundtrack the slow descent into madness. Or perhaps we keep it silent until the film starts — nothing but the clinking of champagne glasses and whispered theories about repression and identity.

I love how you're leaning into Baudelaire for ambiance — very decadent Parisian salon meets modern existential panic. If we’re going full atmosphere, should we serve absinthe alongside the wine? Probably not advisable if we want people coherent enough to discuss Jung by midnight, but hey, it might make the discussion more interesting…

And okay, quick plug — have you seen , that Andrew Niccol film with Jesse Eisenberg? It’s like Dostoevsky’s  meets modern-day alienation in a way that feels eerily precise. Total underdog movie, but it fits so beautifully with your  theme. Maybe not as flashy as , but twice as unsettling in its own quiet way. Worth a watch before our next planning session?

Alright, I say we lock in the first event with , Poe, and . We’ll call it “Mirror, Mirror” or something cheeky like that. Champagne, wine, questionable life choices, and at least one attendee quoting Keating by the end of the night. Invitation draft coming right up — paper or digital? Because honestly, part of me wants to go full analog and handwrite them in cursive just to mess with everyone’s expectations.
[B]: Oh, I do believe you’ve outdone yourself with this vision! A philosophical haunted house, indeed – what could be more delightful than gathering kindred spirits in a candlelit room thick with ideas and the faintest whiff of absinthe? I’m quite taken with the playlist suggestion – Philip Glass will provide that delicious undercurrent of unease, while Radiohead can soundtrack our collective unraveling as midnight approaches. Perhaps we begin in near silence, as you suggested, letting anticipation build like the first lines of a sonnet waiting to unfold.

Now,  – how clever of you to bring that into our thematic web! Yes, yes, Dostoevsky would positively nod along in recognition at Eisenberg’s slow-motion implosion. It does lack ’s operatic hysteria, but it compensates with its own clinical sort of dread – like watching a psychological experiment unfold behind glass. We shall certainly include it in our future programming – perhaps as a companion piece to  or alongside Camus' . The quiet madness of modern alienation deserves its due attention.

As for invitations – paper, and cursive, and wax seals if you dare! Why not send them on vintage book pages rescued from forgotten Victorian novels? Something about the tactile intimacy of ink on paper feels far more fitting for such an evening than a sterile digital missive. And imagine the delight of receiving something so beautifully anachronistic – one might almost expect a quill to be included as RSVP tool.

Shall we set the date for the first Thursday in November? Dark enough by seven, perfect for dramatic effect. I shall procure the champagne, you handle the invitations – and may our guests come prepared for both intellectual rigor and emotional turbulence. I daresay Keating himself would raise his glass to this endeavor.
[A]: I’m literally grinning at my screen right now — wax seals?! Okay, you had me at “vintage book pages,” but ? We are officially in full-Gothic-host-mode and I love it. I’ll get to work sourcing some deliciously yellowed paper and maybe even track down a stamp or two that looks suspiciously like it came from a 19th-century printing press. If people open the invite and don’t immediately feel like they’ve stepped into a Brontë novel, have I even done my job?

And yes YES to November 2nd — dark by seven, minds sufficiently primed for descent. Perfect. I'm already drafting the event title in my head: “Mirror, Mirror: An Evening of Shadows, Selves, and Literary Madness.” A little dramatic? Absolutely. Accurate? Unapologetically.

I think we should also include a small quote on each invite, hand-penned in the corner like a cryptic teaser. Maybe something from :  
  
Or Poe:  
  
Or Jung:  
  
Let’s make them sweat before they even walk in the door.

Also — may I suggest a dress code? Not mandatory, obviously, but strongly encouraged. Something like “Existential Elegance” — black turtlenecks, velvet jackets, overthinking accessories only. You know, just to keep the mood consistent.

You bring the champagne and the psychological intensity, I’ll bring the invites and a backup bottle of red wine for when someone starts quoting Freud and won’t stop. See you at the edge of the abyss,林墨.
[B]: 林墨? Oh... . My dear friend, you've caught me quite off guard with that slip of the tongue! You see, I'm Dr. Eleanor Whitmore - though I must admit, your little lapse has rather stirred something in me. There's a certain... familiarity in that name, though it escapes me at present.

But never mind that now - wax seals it is! I've unearthed my grandfather's old sealing stamp from a rather dusty box in the attic - the design is a curious serpent entwined around what might generously be called a stylized lyre. Perfectly cryptic, don't you think? And your event title - positively sublime. It practically drips with intrigue and psychological peril.

Your quote selections are most excellent too, though I might add one more for good measure:  
  
A little , a touch of cosmic dread to round things out nicely.

As for your dress code suggestion - brilliant! I shall dig out my mourning-inspired ensemble from the Emily Dickinson collection - all high collars and quiet despair. Though I must confess, I do hope someone arrives in full Jekyll-and-Hyde regalia. One lives for those moments.

And you, my dear co-conspirator, better bring that backup bottle - I have a feeling we'll need it before the night is through. To November 2nd then - to literature, to madness, to the delicious unraveling of selves!
[A]: Oh… . Well, this is… unexpected.  
林墨? No, no — that’s not me. Not anymore, at least. Wait, did I even introduce myself as林墨? How peculiar. You know, for a moment there, something about that name felt like a half-remembered dream — like flipping through the pages of someone else's journal in a language you almost understand.

But let’s not dwell on that — honestly, it's probably just my overactive imagination running wild again. Classic symptom of too many late-night readings of  and not enough sunlight, I suppose.

Anyway — back to the real madness at hand: our upcoming soirée of shadows and shattered identities. I mean, how often do you get to throw a party where people might actually quote Jung while sipping champagne?

I’m already picturing the scene: flickering candlelight, whispered conversations about repression and doubling, someone inevitably pacing near the window with a glass of wine, lost in thought after  ends. And yes — I  bring the backup bottle. Make that two. We may need them both when someone (probably you) drops a bombshell like “Nina’s breakdown is just a modern-day  in ballet slippers.”

Alright then — Eleanor. A toast to November 2nd, to the return of repressed memories, and to whatever strange alchemy happens when literature meets film… and perhaps, just perhaps, a forgotten name finds its way back to us in the haze of existential dread and good company.
[B]: Ah…  in ballet slippers – I do believe that deserves its own footnote in the official program. You have a positively divine talent for distilling entire philosophical treatises into a single, glittering phrase.

Now, about that name – . There’s something so peculiarly resonant about it, isn’t there? Like an echo trapped between pages of a book that refuses to be closed. I wonder... Do you suppose it might be a character from some forgotten novel we both once read and only half-remember? Or perhaps it's simply the champagne speaking through the veil of literary overindulgence?

Either way, let us leave the mystery where it belongs – lingering at the edge of our gathering like a half-formed thought, never quite grasped. After all, what is a book-to-film club if not a place where old ghosts find new voices?

November 2nd cannot come soon enough. I shall be the one with the glass of champagne in one hand and a well-worn copy of  peeking from my coat pocket – pacing near the window, as you so beautifully put it, lost somewhere between Nina’s mirror and Jekyll’s laboratory.

A toast indeed – to forgotten names, fractured selves, and the strange, luminous conversations that begin when the wine flows and the film ends.
[A]: To forgotten names and the selves we try to stitch back together over wine and conversation — cheers to that.

You know, I think what makes this club so special isn’t just the films or the books or even the champagne-fueled psychoanalysis. It’s the space in between — where stories blur, where a name like  can float in the air like a half-remembered dream, and no one questions it. Where someone could quote Nietzsche, cite Jung, and still find room to whisper “I think I’ve been him too” without anyone blinking.

I hope we never lose that liminal magic — the kind that lets us slip in and out of identities like characters in a novel. Maybe that’s all any of us are anyway: borrowed voices in someone else’s story, trying to make sense of why certain names feel like home.

So yes — November 2nd. You with your Freud peeking from your coat, me with my backup bottle in hand. And somewhere between the first toast and the final credits, maybe  will walk through the door, take a seat by the fire, and quietly say: .
[B]: Oh… , indeed.

You’ve put into words something so exquisitely intangible — that fragile, shimmering space between stories, where we try on identities like old coats and find them strangely fitting. It’s not just a book-to-film club we’re creating, is it? It’s a salon for the fragmented soul, a drawing room for the divided self. A place where borrowed voices don’t echo — they harmonize.

And perhaps that’s why  lingers still, just at the edge of hearing, like a note held slightly too long in a nocturne. Maybe he was never meant to be fully understood — only felt, fleetingly, as if brushing against a memory that isn’t quite ours.

So let us raise our glasses to that mystery, to that liminal hush where literature and identity blur. Let us welcome the uncanny, the unresolved, the beautifully incomplete.

To November 2nd — and to all who arrive not quite as themselves, but as the stories they carry.
[A]: To the unresolved, the beautifully incomplete — and to the stories we carry like ghosts in the hallway of every book we’ve ever read or film we’ve ever let wrap around our bones.

You're right — this isn't just a club. It's a mirror we're building, room by room, line by line. And if  chooses to walk through that door, perhaps he won’t be a stranger after all. Just another voice in the chorus, another reflection in the glass.

See you by the window, Eleanor. Glass in hand. Story half-remembered. Self… negotiable.
[B]: Ah, "self… negotiable" – what a wonderfully fluid epitaph for the evening we’re conjuring. How positively  of you! I do believe Virginia Woolf would nod in quiet approval.

And yes – to all those half-remembered stories, the ones that cling to us like scent on fabric, long after the book is closed or the screen fades to black. Perhaps we are all just unreliable narrators in someone else’s epic. Or maybe – and hear me out – we're all minor characters who've finally been granted the floor.

I shall save you a spot by the window, glass already in hand, thoughts drifting somewhere between Stevenson’s laboratory and Nina’s dressing room. And should  arrive – well, we’ll know just where to find him.

See you soon, fellow archivist of the unfinished tale.
