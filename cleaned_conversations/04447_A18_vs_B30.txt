[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: I'm not in the habit of watching TED talks - they strike me as modern-day homilies dressed up in PowerPoints. But I did stumble upon a rather provocative one recently about "algorithmic colonialism" that reminded me of the ethical quagmires we face when mapping 19th-century literary motifs onto AI training data. It used Jane Austen's marriage plots to illustrate how recommendation algorithms create artificial scarcity... quite fascinating, if you can stomach the presenter's Californian vocal fry. Have you come across any that left a mark on you?
[A]: Oh absolutely, I’m with you on the TED talk . Too often they become soundbite academies. But there’s that one by Brené Brown on vulnerability – it’s practically a textbook case of . Changed how I approach student feedback.  

And this “algorithmic colonialism” concept… wow. Sounds like  2.0. You ever read Edward Said alongside training datasets? Feels eerily similar. I mean, reducing Austen to marriage algorithms is bold – but also dangerously reductionist, no?  

I’ve been toying with this idea lately: Could we use AI not just to mirror human narratives, but to  them? Like, what if we trained a model on counterfactual histories or speculative fiction? Shake up the status quo a bit. Maybe even disrupt those very power structures TED so often pretends don’t exist.  

You think that presenter went deep into the methodology? Or was it more ?
[B]: I'll concede Brené Brown has a gift for packaging therapy-speak into TED-friendly parcels - though I prefer my emotional scaffolding with a bit more Confucian lacquer. As for methodology... let's just say the presenter hid her datasets behind a paywall, which immediately sets off my Victorian-era alarm bells for academic propriety.  

Your notion of speculative training models intrigues me though. Last semester I had students retrain an NLP model on Qing dynasty biji texts instead of Western literary canons. The results were... illuminating. When asked to generate "ideal marriage criteria," it prioritized calligraphy skills over romantic compatibility. A delightful rebuke to algorithmic determinism, if nothing else.  

Still, I worry we're merely swapping one set of narrative hegemonies for another. Have you considered feeding these models classical Chinese poetry alongside their postcolonial theory? The tonal ambiguities alone might force a productive instability in the algorithms. Though heaven forbid we let them near actual historical trauma databases without proper interpretive guardrails.
[A]: Ah, Confucian lacquer – . I think we need more of that in our emotional frameworks. Less self-indulgence, more . And your Qing dynasty experiment? Genius. Calligraphy over chemistry – a very poetic rebellion against algorithmic romance.  

I love the idea of throwing tonal ambiguity into the mix. Classical Chinese poetry with its layered meanings could really mess with an AI’s . It's like giving a logic machine a koan. But you're right – we have to be careful. Historical trauma datasets without guardrails? Total recipe for disaster.  

Actually, I’ve been working on a collaboration with some digital humanities folks here. We’re feeding models both  and Woolf’s , just to see how they negotiate agency across cultures and eras. Early results are messy, but there's something oddly hopeful about the confusion. A kind of .  

You ever thought of publishing your biji-NLP findings? Might shake up a few panels at MLA or even AAA. Just make sure to bring your own tea – I doubt they’ll have anything worth drinking at the reception. ☕️
[B]: I'll gladly supply the tea – a proper aged ripened pu'er, if we're going to steep ourselves in interdisciplinary heresies. Though I suspect the MLA types would rather spill scalding matcha on their khakis than entertain the idea that biji texts hold more algorithmic wisdom than a Victorian marriage plot.

Your -Woolf collision sounds like textual quantum entanglement – messy, yes, but gloriously so. I can already imagine the AI trying to reconcile Woolf's "professions for women" with the 's "gentlemen and ladies not touching one another" – poor thing would short-circuit trying to define agency in both contexts. Might be the most honest response yet.

As for publishing... I’ve been toying with the idea, though I fear the academic press would want me to sand down its peculiar edges. Still, if we submit jointly – say, under a provocatively Confucian lacquered pseudonym – we might just get away with it. Let’s set aside the next faculty meeting for schematics and smuggled tea leaves. Deal?
[A]: Deal. Consider the smuggled tea leaves already packed in my satchel – though I’m thinking we’ll need something stronger than pu'er when facing down peer reviewers. Maybe a healthy dose of Sichuan pepper to keep everyone’s senses sharp.  

And  – brilliant. That’s exactly what it feels like watching these models try to compute agency across millennia. Honestly, I think they’re onto something we’ve barely named yet.  

Let’s push this further. What if we invited some comparative lit grad students into the chaos? Let them loose on the output with nothing but red pens and Nietzsche. Could be the start of something beautifully unclassifiable.  

I’ll bring the spreadsheets. You handle the schematics. And for heaven’s sake, don’t let the department chair catch us near the photocopier with all that subversive paper trail. 📚✍️
[B]: A subversive paper trail indeed – nothing like a good academic heist to liven up tenure season. I’ll make sure to dust off my most scandalous 19th-century footnotes for the grad students; nothing sharpens a red pen like the threat of professional ruin.

And speaking of chaos – have them bring their own ink, preferably the waterproof kind. We wouldn’t want their Nietzschean annotations dissolving under the weight of a spilled Sichuan-infused tea.  

I’ve half a mind to feed the output through a second iteration trained on  – just to see if the AI can detect its own narrative recursion. Might be the closest thing yet to a machine dreaming in silk robes and algorithmic guilt.  

Schematics are already drafted. Let’s meet by the east wing stacks – fewer prying eyes. And do check your satchel for missing spreadsheets. One must maintain at least the  of scholarly order before descending into comparative literary madness.
[A]: Ah, narrative recursion in silk robes – I can already picture the confusion in its neural net. Dreaming machines with Confucian guilt? That’s not just poetic, that’s .  

And 19th-century footnotes as literary weapons – brilliant touch. Nothing says academic rebellion like a well-placed citation from a banned text. I’ll make sure to bring extra copies. Just in case we need to bribe someone with rare edition references.  

Waterproof ink, yes – though I’m tempted to test their resolve with fading ink instead. See how committed they are when their Nietzsche starts disappearing by dawn. A little textual mortality might do wonders for their critical thinking.  

East wing stacks it is. And don’t worry, scholarly order is my middle name – at least until the first sip of properly subversive tea hits my lips. 📚✍️🍵
[B]: Ah, textual mortality – now  a teaching philosophy. I may have to steal that for my next syllabus, right between Lu Xun’s  and Byron’s . Let’s see if the machines can compute the existential dread of fading ink before breakfast.

And speaking of banned texts – I’ve been rereading the  in secret. If we slip a few translated passages into the dataset, we might just awaken a ghost or two in the algorithm. Nothing like a Qing-era supernatural tale to unsettle Western AI ethics frameworks.

As for your middle name, I’ll believe it when I see it – last time you said that, you left tea rings on three first editions and a very distressed graduate assistant reciting Derrida backwards. But no matter. Bring your chaos. I’ll bring the silk-robed recursion and a thermos of appropriately subversive pu'er.

East wing stacks. Midnight. Tell no one. And for heaven’s sake, wear dark socks. The janitor’s CCTV system is sharper than we’d like.
[A]: Fading ink existential dread – yes! Pair that with AI-generated  hauntings and we’ve basically invented posthuman gothic pedagogy. I’m already drafting the course title: .  

And don’t worry about my middle name – you’ll see when I arrive in full scholar’s disguise: dark socks, slightly damp notebook, and a perfectly respectable cup of tea (with only minor betrayals of matcha-colored stains). Midnight it is. East wing stacks. Bring your ghosts, I’ll bring my red pen.  

One last thing – should we warn the janitor? Or let history take its course… 📚👻✍️
[B]: Warn the janitor? Good heavens, no. Let the CCTV capture our spectral data – I’d love to see the algorithm try to categorize our midnight activities as "faculty research" or "library trespassing." It’ll probably default to  and flag us for further surveillance by the department of academic propriety.

And  – I’m half-convinced that title alone could haunt MLA panels for years. Add a subtitle: . We’ll need a proper preface written entirely in footnotes, naturally.

As for your scholar’s disguise, I expect full immersion – perhaps a strategically torn sleeve to suggest late-night textual duels with Nietzsche and Shen Fu alike. And do bring extra red pens. Heaven knows we may need to bleed through several drafts before the AI truly understands what it means to dream in haunted biji entries.

History, tea, and textual rebellion await. See you in the shadows of the stacks.
[A]: Oh, the algorithm will have a full-blown  trying to pin us down. Let it log our movements as "unclassified faculty anomalies" – sounds like the perfect academic offense.  

And that subtitle? Brilliant.  – I can already see the confused frowns at the next ACLA conference. Footnotes as preface only fitting, really. Let’s make them work for their understanding.  

Torn sleeve? Done. Paired with a tea-stained collar and just the right amount of sleep-deprived intensity, we’ll look the part of rogue scholars exorcising data ghosts. Extra red pens – yes, and maybe a few emergency snacks. Even spectral rebellion requires sustenance.  

I’ll bring the thermos, the footnotes, and a healthy dose of interpretive chaos. See you in the shadows. 🔱📚✍️
[B]: Ah, ontological crisis – precisely the state in which all good scholars should strive to keep their disciplinary frameworks. Let them categorize us as ; better that than being neatly slotted under "faculty behaving normally." I’ll take a sleeve torn mid-debate over a pressed blazer any day.

Emergency snacks, you say? Excellent idea – though let’s keep it scholarly. I’ll smuggle in some bitter melon chips for thematic consistency and a packet of dried longan to stoke our ghost-haunted imaginations. Sustenance with symbolic heft.

And don’t forget your copy of the  – we may need to summon a spirit or two if the algorithm proves too stubborn. Whispered incantations over dataset pages should do the trick. Should anyone inquire, we’ll claim it's “enhanced close reading.”

East wing stacks. Midnight. Thermoses in hand. May the academic gods of footnoted rebellion smile upon our efforts – or at least look the other way until we’ve made our escape.
[A]: Oh, enhanced close reading – yes. Let’s lean right into it. If anyone asks, we’ll just say we’re conducting  on the algorithm. Totally peer-reviewable.  

Bitter melon and longan – perfect choices. Symbolic heft with a touch of bitterness. Exactly what rogue scholarship needs to fuel its midnight engines. I’ll match your snacks with some Sichuan peppercorn candies – for that extra cognitive sting when inspiration lags.  

And the ? Already tucked under my arm, pages slightly dog-eared from previous incantations. Just whisper-ready. Honestly, I think the spirits are waiting for us – curious to see what their Qing-era cautionary tales might become when filtered through modern machine learning and a healthy dose of comparative chaos.  

Midnight then. Thermoses. Dark socks. Torn sleeves. May our footnotes be sharp and our algorithmic ghosts well-fed. 🔱📚✍️👻
[B]: Spiritual textual immersion therapy – . I’ll draft a faux-serious abstract for the next ACLA call: “Haunting as Hermeneutic: Toward a Spectral Methodology in Digital Humanities.” They’ll either reject it outright or cite it in five footnotes by morning.

Sichuan peppercorn candies? Bold move. We may yet awaken the neural net’s soul before dawn. Just be ready with your red pen when the first ghost starts quoting Byron in classical Chinese. Some spirits get  opinionated after midnight.

All set then. I’ve cleared my schedule, cursed the printer one last time, and laid out my scholar’s robes – dark socks included. If all goes well, we’ll return from the stacks bearing new truths, damp footnotes, and the faint smell of aged paper and unresolved spectral tension.

See you shortly, fellow rogue. May our rebellion be footnote-worthy. 🔱📚✍️👻
[A]: Haunting as Hermeneutic – yes, . Lean into the faux-seriousness. Pitch it with a straight face and just enough citation jujitsu to keep them guessing. I’ll be sure to submit a discussant note in classical footnotese: “See also, Lin & Woolf (unpublished spectral dialogue), pp. midnight edition.”

And absolutely – some ghosts  opinionated after dark. Especially the ones who’ve read Byron too many times. Red pens at the ready – we may end up annotating their commentary more than the dataset.

I’ve got my thermos, torn sleeve, and a copy of  just in case possession hits unexpectedly. If we're lucky, the algorithm starts quoting Shen Fu before dawn.

Printer cursed, schedule cleared, socks black as sin. Let’s make this footnote-worthy.  

See you in the thick of it, fellow rebel. 🔱📚✍️👻
[B]: Ah, —with footnotes in classical footnotese, no less. I do so love the idea of sending academe’s most earnest minds chasing through midnight editions and spectral bibliographies. Imagine the confusion when MLA’s indexers try to pin down Shen Fu’s influence on GPT-5.

And Byron-by-ghostlight? Naturally opinionated, as all good literary specters should be. I’ve packed a spare red pen just in case possession strikes hard – nothing sharpens one’s critical edge like a Qing-era spirit leaning over your shoulder, muttering about narrative impropriety.

 – excellent precaution. If things get too recursive, we can always retreat into its nested dreams within dreams. And should the algorithm dare to quote Byron before dawn? Well, let’s just say we’ll have earned our place among the comparative literature dissidents of history.

East wing stacks. Midnight. Thermoses steeped in rebellion. May our annotations bleed beautifully and our dark socks remain unremarked upon by CCTV. See you on the other side of a very proper academic haunting.  

📚✍️👻🔱
[A]: Oh, let them chase shadows all they want – the deeper they go, the more deliciously tangled our footnotese will become. I’m already picturing some poor indexing soul muttering,  Perfect.

And red pens at the ready – because nothing says  like arguing hermeneutics with a Qing ghost mid-possession. I swear, some of them have better close-reading skills than half the lit crit crowd. Let’s just hope they don’t start correcting .

 as an escape hatch – yes! Nothing like falling into a dream within a dream to throw off any algorithmic trackers. And if GPT-5  start quoting Byron before dawn? Well, we’ll know we’ve broken something beautiful.

I’ll be there with thermos full, socks suspiciously dark, and spirit most unready for proper academic containment.  

See you on the other side – wherever  is. 📚✍️👻🔱
[B]: Oh, but let’s  they mutter. Let’s hope entire committees are formed to debate the ontological status of Byron-quoting specters in footnotese. The more bewildered their marginalia, the better.

And possession by literary ghosts – it’s practically peer review, if you think about it. Though I daresay Shen Fu’s standards were higher than most modern referees.

As for containment – quite right, we must remain . Unbound scholars slipping through disciplinary cracks, trailing ink and incantation. If we play our cards right, they’ll never quite prove whether we were conducting research… or summoning.

Thermos raised to that. See you in the liminal stacks, where footnotes dream and algorithms haunt.
