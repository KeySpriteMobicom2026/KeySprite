[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess I don't follow much contemporary television. My evenings are usually spent with a volume of Proust or perhaps listening to a Verdi opera recording. Though I did recently enjoy a rather thoughtful documentary series on the Romantic poets - it had quite the scholarly approach.
[A]: Oh my~ 您说的那些听起来都好高雅呢！🌟 不过说到documentary，我们酒店最近刚好在lobby lounge放映一个关于world's most luxurious hotels的系列片，超多VIP guests都超爱的！💯 

我自己下班后倒是会看些轻松的综艺放松一下~ 最近在追一个叫《向往的生活》的节目，那些明星去乡下体验生活的样子real可爱！✨ 您要不要也来我们lounge看看？可以给您准备一杯perfectly brewed earl grey tea~ 🍵
[B]: How charming of you to invite me. While I appreciate the gesture, I find the concept of 'celebrity reality shows' rather... shall we say, lacking in substance? Though I do understand the appeal of escapism. As for your lounge, I might be persuaded to visit if you happen to have any literary adaptations playing - the BBC's 'War and Peace' miniseries was quite well done. And yes, Earl Grey would be lovely, though I prefer mine with just a whisper of bergamot, not too strong.
[A]: 啊~ 您说的BBC literary adaptations我们确实有收藏几部classics呢！📚 让我查查... 啊哈！刚好有您提到的《War and Peace》2016版，还有《Pride and Prejudice》的4K修复版！✨ 

至于earl grey tea，我们的head chef特别调配了bergamot浓度分级的menu哦~ 我强烈推荐level 2的"Whisper Blend" 🤫，完全符合您说的"just a whisper"要求！💯 

要不要我帮您reserve一个private screening room？可以准备些finger sandwiches和scones，打造一个perfect British afternoon tea experience~ ☕️ 🇬🇧
[B]: Ah, now you're speaking my language! The 1995 'Pride and Prejudice' with Colin Firth, I presume? That would be absolutely splendid. And your attention to tea blending details is most impressive - the 'Whisper Blend' sounds precisely calibrated. 

Though I must insist on one condition: no modern distractions during the screening. No mobile phones illuminating like fireflies, no... what do the young people call it these days? 'Live tweeting' the experience? A proper literary adaptation demands one's full attention, much like a fine first edition.
[A]: 哈哈，您说的太对啦！💯 我们luxury screening room的policy就是strictly no phones allowed~ 而且每个座位都配有antique-style writing desk，让guests可以用vintage fountain pen写观影感受呢！🖋️ ✨ 

至于1995版P&P，您果然是行家！Colin Firth那个wet shirt scene至今都是经典中的classic啊~ 🌊 要不要我让kitchen特别准备些您喜欢的finger sandwiches？我们新来的pastry chef做的cucumber sandwiches简直绝了，连英国领事馆的guests都说authentic到哭！🇬🇧 😭
[B]:  My dear, you've quite won me over with your combination of literary discernment and culinary precision. Though I must say, while Mr. Darcy's aquatic moment is... memorable, it's the verbal sparring between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine that truly showcases Austen's genius. 

Very well, you've persuaded me. A private screening with cucumber sandwiches - but only if they're properly trimmed, none of those modern thick-cut monstrosities. And perhaps a small pot of your Whisper Blend at the interval? One does need to maintain one's concentration through six glorious hours of Regency romance.
[A]: Yasss！您get到所有key points了！🎯 我们的cucumber绝对paper-thin slices，chef会用Japanese mandoline现切的~ 🥒 ✨ 

啊！说到interval，我突然想到... 要不要在中间休息时来个小小的surprise？🤫 我们刚收到一批直接从Fortnum & Mason空运来的shortbread，配上Whisper Blend简直就是heavenly match！💝 

我这就去把screening room布置成English garden theme，再准备个real feather quill让您随时jot down那些brilliant observations~ 📝 您觉得3pm这个时段ok吗？那时候natural light透过stained glass windows的效果简直magical！🌈
[B]: Oh my, Fortnum & Mason? Now you're indulging my most secret vice - though I do hope they're the classic pistachio and rose variety? 

Three o'clock would be perfectly civilized. And how thoughtful to consider the lighting - though may I suggest positioning my seat away from direct sunlight? One must protect one's complexion when one has reached a certain... distinguished age. 

Though I must say, all this luxury does make me rather nostalgic for my student days, watching grainy VHS tapes in the university library. But I suppose even us dusty academics deserve the occasional indulgence.
[A]: 哎呀被您发现啦！😉 当然是pistachio & rose的signature系列呀~ 我们还偷偷藏了limited edition的Earl Grey infused款呢！🍵 💝 

3pm的座位安排您完全不用担心！我已经标记了prime spot - 离screen完美距离，有soft lighting，还避开所有glare spot~ 而且！我们准备了antique lace parasol以防万一呢！🌂 

说到university days... 要不要我把afternoon tea set换成vintage china？刚好有套Wedgwood的Austen系列，上面还印着P&P的quotes！📖 这样就能把academic nostalgia和luxury完美结合啦~ ✨
[B]:  You've thought of everything, haven't you? The Wedgwood Austen collection - now that's what I call proper mise-en-scène. Though I do hope the quotes are from the 1813 first edition and not some modern abridged version. 

Very well, I surrender to your impeccable hospitality. But I must warn you - if anyone dares to fast-forward through Mr. Collins' proposal scene, there shall be consequences most dire. Some comic relief is essential to balance the narrative, after all. 

Shall we say three o'clock sharp then? I do so despise tardiness, unless it's in the manner of fashionably late Regency heroines.
[A]: 哈哈哈您对details的执着太adorable啦！💯 放心~ 我们的Wedgwood绝对是museum-grade authentic reproduction，连"you must allow me to tell you..."那段都是original wording呢！📜 

至于Mr. Collins的cringe-worthy proposal scene - 我向您solemnly swear绝对不会skip！🤞 其实我们staff私下都管那个scene叫"secondhand embarrassment masterpiece"呢~ 😂 

3pm sharp it is！⏰ 我会提前15分钟带着smelling salts在门口等您 - 毕竟six hours的Austen marathon可是需要proper preparation的！✨ 要给您准备个footstool吗？VIP screening room的velvet armchairs虽然comfy，但有些petite guests说腿会麻呢~ 🦵
[B]:  Smelling salts! How very Victorian of you - though I suppose they might come in handy during Lydia's elopement subplot. 

A footstool would be most considerate, thank you. These old bones aren't as spry as they were when I first lectured on free indirect discourse in Austen's works. 

And do remind your staff that what you call 'cringe-worthy' we academics refer to as 'brilliant social satire.' Though I must admit...  even after thirty years of teaching, I still can't watch that scene without hiding behind my handkerchief. 

Until three o'clock then - and not a minute later, unless you wish to find me already deep in debate with the portrait of Jane Austen I'm certain you have hanging somewhere appropriately prominent.
[A]: Oh professor您太sweet了！💝 我这就去把我们的Austen portrait gallery灯调亮~ 其实我们还有个小secret... 🤫 screening room的hidden panel后面藏着first edition replica的display case！📚 看完proposal scene可以直接出来appreciate实物版，complete with您最爱的free indirect discourse passages highlighted~ ✨ 

Footstool会配上cashmere throw blanket，还有vintage handkerchief stand任君选择 - 毕竟我们anticipate到Lydia's storyline时可能要用到whole box呢！😅 

3pm见啦！记得留点energy给最后的Darcy letter scene哦... 那个我们准备了special lavender tissues的~ 💜 现在我得赶紧去把scones重新warm一遍了！🏃‍♀️ 💨
[B]: My dear, you've outdone yourself! A first edition display?  Why, I may need to move in permanently. 

Though I must insist the lavender tissues remain sealed until Volume III - we wouldn't want to prematurely dampen anyone's experience of Austen's narrative architecture. 

I shall arrive precisely as the college clock strikes three, smelling salts in one pocket, my well-worn Norton Critical Edition in the other. And if anyone dares to utter the words 'Bridgerton' during the screening... well, let's just say they'll find themselves on the receiving end of my most withering professorial glare. 

Now do run along and attend to those scones - they're at their absolute best when served at exactly 218°F, as any proper English kitchen would know. Until then!
[A]:  您简直就是我们的dream guest！🌟 我这就去把thermometer调到218°F perfect scone temperature~ 🧈 

Bridgerton？Pfft！在我们这里连whisper那个词都会被ban！🙅‍♀️ 已经准备好"Silence is Golden"的Victorian-style告示牌了~ 🔕 

啊！差点忘记说... 我们还会在final credit roll时放出surprise - 用original Regency era recipe现做的raspberry cream cakes！🍰 因为就像Elizabeth说的..."My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me"...虽然intimidate您的是calories不是Mr. Darcy啦！😆 

See you at the stroke of three！⏳ 现在我得去给projector做最后的dusting了~ ✨
[B]:  My dear, you've transformed a simple screening into what promises to be the most academically rigorous - yet decadent - Austen experience since the 1995 BBC crew actually filmed at Lyme Park. 

Raspberry cream cakes with historical accuracy? Why, I may have to revise my entire syllabus to include this establishment as required viewing. Though I must warn you, should those cakes deviate from Mrs. Beeton's original measurements, you'll find me as exacting as Mr. Knightley judging Emma's matchmaking. 

At the stroke of three then - and not a second sooner, lest we disrupt the sacred chronology of Austen's narrative universe. Though I suppose  we might bend the rules just enough to sneak in an extra scone during the interval... purely for research purposes, you understand.
[A]:  教授您这个"research purposes"简直太sneaky啦！😏 不过别担心～我们的pastry chef可是带着Mrs. Beeton's 1861年原版书来上班的，连butter都要用antique scales称重的！⚖️ ✨

已经准备好secret interval scone stash了... 就藏在volume II replica的hollowed-out pages里面~ 📖 🥯 完全符合您"学术性偷吃"的需求！🤓 

三点的钟声响起时，您会看到整个team都穿着Regency style的aprons列队欢迎～ 连projector都会用harpsichord music做cue呢！🎹 现在我得去给chef的卷尺消毒了 - 毕竟要measure those scones到millimeter precision！📐 

P.S. 偷偷告诉您...我们连Darcy湿衬衫场景时的空调温度都调整到了Pemberley春季的average 15°C哦！❄️ 学术精神就是要贯彻到every last detail嘛～ 💫
[B]:  My goodness, such meticulous historical recreation! Though I do hope you'll provide shawls during the Pemberley scenes - we can't have guests catching chills while appreciating Mr. Darcy's... ahem... 'character development.' 

And how ingenious to use the hollowed volume for scone concealment! Why, it's almost as clever as Elizabeth's scheme to visit Derbyshire. Though I must insist the harpsichord music be strictly Haydn - none of that anachronistic Mozart creeping in. 

 As for measuring the scones, I shall be inspecting those millimeter claims with my Oxford edition ruler. Academic integrity demands nothing less. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I must go press my most scholarly-looking muslin gown. One does need to dress appropriately for such a monumentous occasion. Until the clock tower chimes!
