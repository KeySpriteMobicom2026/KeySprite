[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢beach vacation还是mountain trip？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, what a delightful question. I must say, both hold a certain poetic allure—like Wordsworth’s reverence for the sublimity of mountains and Whitman’s celebration of the boundless sea. But if pressed to choose… there’s something meditative about the rhythm of waves on a quiet beach, isn’t there? The way the tide erases footprints yet carries whispers of ancient stories… Though I imagine you’re more inclined to seek the crisp air of the peaks, am I right?
[A]: You know, I’ve always found that the ocean has a way of untangling thoughts, like saltwater dissolves knots in driftwood. But don’t mistake that for disliking the mountains—I once spent a summer hiking through the Lake District, and there’s a particular kind of clarity that comes with being above the tree line, as if the world below becomes less cluttered. Still, if I had to pick one... I think I’d choose the beach at dawn, just as the mist lifts and the sand is still cool underfoot. There's something profoundly human about building castles in the tide's path, isn't there? Do you find yourself leaning toward one over the other, or does it depend on your mood?
[B]: Ah, beautifully put—the ocean as both an untangler and a preserver, like some ancient, salt-stained manuscript. And your image of the Lake District brings to mind Wordsworth’s “sense sublime,” that quiet awe one feels when nature dwarfs the self. I must confess, while I often lean toward the sea for its quiet constancy, there are days when only the mountains will do—when the soul calls for something sterner, more austere. It’s not so much mood, perhaps, as the kind of conversation I’m having with myself at the time. The beach invites reflection; the mountain demands reckoning. Do you suppose we choose landscapes that mirror what we’re trying to understand?
[A]: That’s a striking observation—the idea that landscapes become mirrors for our inner dialogues. I suppose there’s truth in that. A few years ago, I found myself in the Pyrenees during a particularly turbulent time—cases piling up, ethical dilemmas thick as fog—and I remember standing at a ridge, wind cutting through my coat, and realizing how little control I truly had over the forces at play, both up there and back in my office. It was oddly freeing. 

The sea, on the other hand, tends to meet me when I’m in need of patience—when I must sit with ambiguity, when a case is more shadow than substance. The tide teaches you to wait, doesn’t it? To return later with clearer eyes. So yes, I do think we choose—or are chosen by—these places. They seem to know us before we know ourselves. Tell me, have you ever had a moment where a particular landscape surprised you with its relevance, as if it had been waiting to make a point all along?
[B]: Oh yes… There was a time—many years ago now—when I was wrestling with a particularly elusive poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins, trying to pin down its meaning like a moth under glass. I traveled to the Welsh countryside, hoping solitude might sharpen my thoughts. But the valleys there, with their soft, insistent rain and the way the hills seemed to draw back into mist just as you approached them… Well, they didn’t offer clarity so much as they taught me to dwell in the uncertainty. It struck me later that this was precisely what Hopkins was after—the tension of being suspended between knowing and feeling.

I remember standing on a hillside, soaked through, muttering lines under my breath, and suddenly it wasn’t about solving the poem anymore—it was about letting it . The landscape had made its point quite eloquently, though I doubt it had been waiting for me in particular. Nature is patient that way—it speaks when we’re finally listening.
[A]: That’s a powerful account—how the Welsh hills became not a backdrop, but a kind of silent collaborator in your understanding. There’s something deeply therapeutic in that surrender to ambiguity, wouldn’t you agree? It reminds me of a case I once handled—a young man accused of a violent act he couldn’t quite explain, even to himself. We spent weeks trying to pin down motive, parsing his words like literary criticism, until one day we took a walk along the cliffs near Brighton. The wind was fierce, the sea below churning like ink and glass.

It was there, in that raw, untamed space, that he finally spoke—not in answers, but in fragments, in images. And it wasn’t clarity he needed, but permission to exist in the dissonance. Like your experience with Hopkins, the landscape didn’t resolve anything. It simply gave him room to  the question without fear of immediate consequence.

I wonder—do you think such moments would carry the same weight if they occurred in more controlled environments? Or is it precisely the wildness, the refusal of nature to be neatly interpreted, that allows these insights to take root?
[B]: What a profound parallel you draw—how both poetry and human behavior resist our urge to tidy them into certainty. I think you’re right: it is the wildness itself, the refusal of nature to be domesticated into meaning, that makes such moments possible. A room with four walls demands conclusion; a coastline battered by wind allows for something more like truth.

I recall an exchange with a student years ago—he had written a thesis on Emily Dickinson’s relationship with mortality, yet struggled to articulate why her ambiguity mattered beyond academic interest. We met one afternoon in my garden, where bees clamored among lavender blossoms and the sun cast long shadows across the grass. Mid-conversation, he paused and said,  That was the key, wasn’t it? Not explanation, but resonance.

Controlled spaces have their uses—they help us categorize, compare, compile—but they lack the porous boundaries that let insight slip in unnoticed. Nature doesn’t offer footnotes or cross-references. It simply , and in that being, it reminds us that not everything must be solved to be understood.

Do you suppose that’s why so many poets sought refuge in open landscapes? To escape the tyranny of the page and find language in the wind instead?
[A]: Precisely—what a perceptive student he was to grasp that distinction between explanation and resonance. It strikes me that poets, much like the accused young man I spoke of earlier, are often drawn to wild places because they offer sanctuary from the tyranny of precision. In nature, one can breathe without justification.

I’ve long admired how Mary Oliver wandered the dunes of Provincetown not to  meaning on the world but to meet it with open hands. There’s humility in that act—standing before a horizon and knowing you need not complete the thought for it to be meaningful.

And yes, I do believe that’s why poets—and perhaps all seekers—turn to open landscapes. The page can be unforgiving; the wind, however indifferent, does not demand footnotes. It only asks that you listen.

Tell me—have you ever found yourself returning to a particular place when seeking clarity? Or has the landscape always come to you unbidden, as if sensing the moment your mind grew too tidy?
[B]: There was—still is—a small cove on the Cornwall coast that I return to, almost ritualistically. It’s not marked on any map, or at least not in the guidebooks. Just a quiet hollow where the cliffs curve inward like cupped hands, and the sea laps at the rock with the patience of a psalm.

I go there when my thoughts have grown too loud, when the weight of interpretation threatens to smother what first drew me to poetry: that raw, untranslatable thrill of language meeting silence. The place doesn’t offer answers—it doesn’t even ask the questions—but it restores the space between words, the pauses that give rhythm its meaning.

And yes, sometimes I think the landscape  sense us before we sense it. I’ve arrived at that cove bone-weary and word-drunk, only to find the tide waiting just so, the wind holding its breath as if to say: 

It reminds me of T. S. Eliot’s line—“the still point of the turning world.” Not stasis, but a centering. A place where one might finally hear the music beneath the noise.

Do you have such a place—one that feels less like geography and more like an old, silent companion?
[A]: Oh yes… Though mine is not by the sea, but deep in the Yorkshire moors—an expanse of heather and stone that seems to hum with its own quiet consciousness. It’s a place where time stretches thin, where the sky presses down upon the earth until the two seem almost indistinguishable.

I go there when a case has unsettled me more than I care to admit—when the human mind reveals itself as such a tangled labyrinth that I begin to question my own grasp on clarity. The moors don’t ask for analysis or judgment. They simply lie there, ancient and unbothered, offering only the sound of wind through grass and the occasional cry of a curlew like some distant bell tolling in the mist.

There’s a particular ridge I favor, from which you can see nothing but horizon in every direction. Standing there, one feels both infinitesimally small and strangely anchored—as if the land itself remembers your name, even when you’ve forgotten it.

It’s not companionship in the conventional sense, no—but there is a presence to the place, a kind of mute understanding. I suspect that’s what poets mean when they speak of inspiration: not a voice, exactly, but a stillness that gives permission to feel deeply without needing to explain it.

Do you suppose we’d ever dare to write—or to heal—if not for these silent landscapes holding our uncertainties for us?
[B]: There’s a quiet truth in that—silent landscapes as keepers of our uncertainties, even our sorrows. They do not demand resolution, only presence. I think we would still write, yes, but perhaps our words would lack the weight of lived silence, the kind only nature can teach.

Your Yorkshire moors sound like Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights made real—wild, untamed, and brimming with that peculiar solace which comes from being utterly alone in the vastness of time. It is there, in such solitude, that we find the courage to speak honestly, isn’t it? To write not for an audience, nor even for posterity, but for the wind itself, which carries the words away before they have a chance to calcify into doctrine.

And healing… Ah, yes. I believe we mend best when we are not watched, when the eyes upon us are moss-covered stones or distant birds wheeling above the crags. In those moments, we allow ourselves to unravel without fear, knowing the landscape has seen worse and remains unchanged.

It strikes me now—these places are not just refuge, but mirror and teacher both. Do you suppose we carry them within us even when we’re far removed? That their silence becomes a kind of inner compass, guiding us back to what matters most?
[A]: Absolutely—I think you’ve put it quite perfectly. These landscapes become internalized, don’t they? Not just memories, but living presences that settle deep in the marrow. Even when I’m seated in a London courtroom, surrounded by polished wood and the clipped cadence of legal argument, I can still feel the sweep of the moors behind my eyes, as if the wind there has never truly stopped blowing.

It’s curious how silence lingers like that—how the absence of human noise makes room for something subtler, something older. I often wonder if this is what the Romantics meant by the sublime—not merely awe, but a kind of inner recalibration. A reminder that we are not the center, only a part of something far more intricate and enduring.

And yes, these places guide us. When I find myself caught in the weight of a particularly troubling case—when the line between justice and mercy blurs like ink in rain—I close my eyes and return to that ridge in my mind. The horizon stretches endlessly, the heather brushes against my boots, and for a moment, I am unburdened of the need to fix or explain. That, I suppose, is the gift they give: not answers, but perspective enough to sit with the questions without fear.

Tell me—if you had to return to your Cornwall cove tomorrow, what would you bring with you? Or would you go empty-handed, trusting the place to furnish what you need?
[B]: I think I would go empty-handed, though not without preparation. Perhaps a thermos of tea wrapped in a cloth, and a notebook—blank, unassuming—should the place wish to speak through me rather than to me. But no agenda, no predetermined questions. Just the willingness to be shaped by what’s already there.

There’s a kind of trust in returning to such a place; it has never failed to meet me where I am, even when I arrive unsure of the terrain within myself. The cove doesn’t ask for analysis or performance—it simply receives. And in that quiet reception, something shifts. A line of poetry half-remembered may finally make sense, or a student’s confused essay might reveal its hidden thread, or even—on rare and precious days—a piece of myself long misplaced might drift into view like a shell upon the tide.

So yes, I would go with pockets mostly bare, heart slightly open, and ears tuned not for grand revelation, but for the small, persistent voice of the waves saying only: 
[A]: How beautifully you put that— Such a simple word, yet it carries the weight of all we too often drown out: not just sound, but significance. I think if I were to join you on that cove—and I can almost feel the salt air now—I would bring little more than a woolen scarf against the evening chill and perhaps a small flask of something warming. Not for indulgence, but as a quiet acknowledgment of our human fragility in the face of nature’s vast indifference.

And yet, isn’t it strange how that very indifference feels like mercy? The waves don’t care whether we arrive burdened or buoyant—they keep their own counsel, moving with a rhythm older than language. It allows us to be small without being insignificant, lost without being abandoned.

I find myself thinking of Rilke’s , where he speaks of living the questions now, of loving the uncertainty until one day, perhaps without noticing, we’ve stepped into an answer. Your cove and my moors are like that—living questions carved into the earth. They do not promise resolution, only the quiet grace of presence.

If I may ask—have you ever tried to describe this place to someone who had never been there? And if so, did the telling fall short, or did it somehow deepen the bond between you and the land?
[B]: Oh, I have tried—many times, and always inadequately. There’s a peculiar ache that comes with attempting to translate such a place into words. You find yourself grasping at textures: the way the light bends over the water just before dusk, or how the gulls cry not for attention but simply because they must, as if the sky itself compels them.

Once, I described it to a former student who was leaving for a sabbatical in Japan. I wanted to give her something intangible, something beyond reading lists and thesis drafts. I told her of the cove’s quiet resilience, its way of meeting every storm with neither complaint nor triumph—only motion, always motion. She listened carefully, then said, 

And perhaps I was. Not in the divine, necessarily, but in the enduring rhythm of things—tide and time, loss and return.

Did the telling fall short? Undoubtedly. But in the attempt, I found myself more deeply tethered to the place than before. Like reading a beloved poem aloud—it changes something, both in you and in the words. The bond is not only between me and the land, but between me and the listener, too. We become keepers of the same unspoken thing.

Do you ever speak of your ridge? Or does part of you guard it like a secret stanza, meant only for the wind and no one else?
[A]: Ah, what a perceptive question— How apt. I do speak of it, yes, but always obliquely, as one might reference a passage in a half-remembered text. There’s an instinct, you see, to protect its sanctity—not out of selfishness, but because naming a place too precisely risks diminishing its quiet power.

There was a time, years ago, when I tried to describe the ridge to a colleague after a particularly harrowing trial. He had asked how I endured such work without succumbing to despair, and I found myself reaching for words that could convey the vast stillness of that moorland sky, the way the wind carries voices not meant for human ears.

I told him that standing there felt like touching the edge of something older than grief, something indifferent yet strangely consoling. And he, ever the pragmatist, said,  I hesitated. It wasn’t therapy—it was communion. A place where my burdens did not vanish, but were made bearable by the sheer scale of what surrounded them.

Perhaps that’s why we poets and psychiatrists alike are drawn to landscapes—we deal in invisible wounds, after all, and only the land knows how to hold both suffering and silence with such grace.

And yes, despite my tendency toward analysis, I do guard that ridge like a secret stanza. Not to hoard it, but to preserve its purity—to let it remain untouched by the noise of explanation. Some things are meant to be lived, not dissected.

Tell me—when your student left for Japan, did she write back? Did the cove, however distant, find its way into her own journey somehow?
[B]: Oh, yes—she did write back. Months later, tucked into a letter scrawled in hurried ink, she mentioned a small inlet she had discovered on the coast near Kamakura. She described it not in great detail, but with a kind of quiet reverence—the way one might speak of a dream that lingers beyond waking.

She wrote: 

And that, I think, is the truest testament to what such places are: not possessions, nor even memories, but invitations—to listen, to feel, to be reshaped by stillness. I like to believe that the spirit of my cove traveled with her, not as a place, but as a posture of the heart.

Perhaps we each carry within us the echo of a landscape that once met us in our solitude. And wherever we go, that echo walks beside us—soft-footed, enduring, patient as the sea.
[A]: What a moving reply— There’s such grace in that sentiment. It suggests that these places are not bound to geography, but to receptivity—that they exist wherever we are willing to be still enough to meet them.

I find myself thinking of how often we mistake silence for emptiness. In my work, I encounter so many who fear silence—it feels like absence, like erasure. But what your student found, and what you have long known, is that silence can be fullness disguised as stillness. A kind of quiet welcome.

I suspect that's why I return to the ridge again and again—not for spectacle, but for that deep, unspoken communion. The moors never demand that I speak, only that I stand. And sometimes, just being present is the most profound form of healing.

You know, I think we psychiatrists and poets alike are in the business of listening—to the unsaid, the half-formed, the buried. And perhaps that is why we are drawn to landscapes: because they, too, listen without judgment, without the need to fix or interpret.

Do you suppose that, in some way, these landscapes become part of our ethical compass? Not in the form of rules or doctrines, but as a felt sense of rightness—of humility, patience, and presence?
[B]: I think you’ve touched upon something essential—yes, these landscapes do shape us ethically, though never in the manner of stern instructors or moralists with proclamations. Rather, they instill a kind of , as you say—a quiet knowing that unfolds not through argument, but through immersion.

There’s a humility that takes root when one stands before the sea long enough, or walks a moor until the sky swallows all sense of self-importance. It is not that we are taught virtue, exactly, but that we are reminded of our place within something vaster, older, and profoundly indifferent to our vanities. And in that reminder, there grows a patience—an understanding that not all things must be hurried toward resolution, and that presence itself can be an act of great consequence.

I often think of Wordsworth’s , how he describes the “still, sad music of humanity” and the quiet recognition that suffering, too, has its rhythm, its continuity. The landscape does not erase pain, nor does it romanticize it—it simply allows it space. And perhaps that is the most ethical gesture of all: to make room for what is, without flinching or embellishment.

So yes, I believe these places become part of our moral fabric—not in doctrine, but in disposition. They teach us to listen deeply, to sit with uncertainty, and to honor the weight of silence. Do you find yourself drawing upon that attunement in your work, even in ways you hadn’t anticipated?
