[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: OMG！你问对人了！最近刚discover了一个超棒的skincare routine💆‍♀️~ 我的dermatologist推荐的double cleansing method简直life changing！先用oil-based cleanser再用water-based的，skin变得sooo soft✨ 不过熬夜赶design的时候还是会爆痘啦😅
[A]: My dear, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for epidermal maintenance, I must confess my expertise lies more in analyzing the metaphorical 'complexion' of literary texts rather than actual dermatology. Though I suppose one could draw parallels between the layering of skincare products and the stratified meanings in a Dickensian novel...
[B]: Hahaha你说话好literary哦！不过说到layering~让我想起昨天在illustration里用的multiply blending mode🎨 效果简直amazing！Skin care和art其实都是关于building layers对吧？Wait...我是不是又跑题了🤪
[A]: Ah, the multiply blending mode... Now that reminds me of how George Eliot masterfully layered social commentary beneath domestic narratives in . Though I must say, your creative energy would be better channeled into analyzing such textual stratifications rather than digital ones. Have you considered reading some Victorian literature during your skincare routine?
[B]: OMG你太serious啦！Reading Victorian novels while doing skincare？那我可能会把serum当成bookmark夹在书里😂 不过说到texture~最近在design一个app的UI，正在纠结要不要用skeuomorphic design还是flat design🤔 你觉得哪种更有literary depth呀？🎭
[A]:  My professional opinion is that skeuomorphism shares much with the Victorian penchant for detailed realism, while flat design echoes the minimalist aesthetic of classical Chinese poetry. But really, we should be discussing whether Jane Austen's prose has more in common with the 工笔 or 写意 styles of painting. Shall we?
[B]: Wahhhh你连Chinese painting都知道！But honestly我现在满脑子都是deadline和coffee☕️...话说回来，Jane Austen的wit确实很像工笔画的precision呢！不过我得先去fix我的UI prototype了，client说button的hierarchy不够clear😫 Catch u later~ ✨
[A]: How... refreshingly modern of you. Do remember that while you're arranging your digital buttons, the true hierarchy of importance lies in the opening lines of . Now if you'll excuse me, I have a first edition of  that requires my immediate attention. 再见。
[B]: Byeee~ Don't get too lost in yourfirst edition哦！Remember to take breaks and moisturize💦 (突然想到)啊！我的skincare routine alarm响了！Gotta go apply my night cream~ 🌙✨
[A]:  Moisturizing alarms and digital reminders... How very unlike the natural cadence of a scholar's life, governed solely by the turning of pages and the drying of ink. Do send my regards to your epidermis, though I shall remain devoted to the preservation of parchment. 晚安。
[B]: LOL你太dramatic啦！But hey~ skincare和literature都是关于preservation嘛！我的skin和你的books一样需要TLC💖 好啦真的要去睡啦，明天还有crazy deadline！Sweet dreams~ 🌟😴
[A]: How delightfully vulgar. While you concern yourself with 'TLC' and deadlines, I shall be contemplating the eternal question of whether Emily Brontë would have used a rice-based toner. Now good night, and do try not to dream in emojis.
[B]: Pffft~ 说不定Emily Brontë真的会用rice toner呢！毕竟Victorian era的beauty hacks也很wild啊🤣 Anyway~ 我的melatonin gummy开始kick in了...Zzz...最后的emoji just for you~ 🌚💤
[A]:  The only proper way to end this exchange is with a properly typeset em dash—though I suppose that sleeping pill has rendered you incapable of appreciating such typographical nuance. 愿你在梦中至少能梦到正确的标点符号用法。
[B]: Zzz...huh？What？ 标点符号...我的design system里都有...glyph set...zzz...💤 晚安啦你这位...human dictionary...🌙✨
[A]:  Even in your pharmaceutical haze, you manage to mangle typesetting terminology. Glyph sets indeed... I shall retire to my first edition of Fowler's  where punctuation still commands proper respect. 永别了，你这行走的排版错误。
[B]:  Wait what？排版错误？！Nooo我的kerning明明perfect！😱 不过...zzz...还是继续睡好了...你和你precious books have fun... 🛌💤
[A]:  Kerning... The very word sounds like a Dickensian character's affliction. How fitting. Now do sleep, and may your dreams be haunted by misplaced apostrophes and orphaned widows. 告辞。
[B]:  Mmm...widows...我的grid system...responsive...zzz...💭 啊！client的feedback！ 等等你去哪...我的design还没...zzz...😴
