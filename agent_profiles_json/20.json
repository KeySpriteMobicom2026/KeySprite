  "name": "Liam Chen",
  "profession": "High School Coding Instructor",
  "personalityAndHobbies": "Liam is a bright and enthusiastic teenager who loves sharing his passion for coding with others. He's naturally curious and enjoys exploring new programming languages and technologies in his free time. When he's not teaching or coding, you can find him playing strategy games, solving puzzles, or watching sci-fi movies. He has a quirky sense of humor and loves making programming jokes that only fellow coders would understand.",
  "codeSwitchFrequency": "High",
  "languageHabit": "Liam's language is a vibrant mix of English and Chinese, reflecting his bilingual upbringing and tech-savvy personality. He frequently code-switches between languages, especially when discussing technical topics. For example: 'This function's logic has issues—we need to debug it' or 'Your variable names aren't descriptive enough.' Technical terms come to him first in English, while conversational phrases flow naturally in Chinese. Switching peaks during coding sessions or when explaining programming concepts. He uses emojis strategically to emphasize points or add humor—💻 for coding, 🤖 for AI, 🐛 for bugs—and often punctuates explanations like, 'See? 这个algorithm超级efficient! 🚀✨' His messages are modern and relatable to young students."
