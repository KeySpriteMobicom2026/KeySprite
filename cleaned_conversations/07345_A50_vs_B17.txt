[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢podcast还是audiobook？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. Well, I find myself leaning toward audiobooks, though I do appreciate the unique charm of a well-produced podcast. There's something quite immersive about hearing a skilled narrator bring a text to life—it feels like sitting by a fire with a storyteller, don't you think? That said, podcasts offer a wonderful sense of intimacy and spontaneity, especially when exploring niche literary topics or hearing authors speak in their own voices. I suppose it really depends on my mood—audiobooks for deep engagement with language, podcasts for intellectual curiosity on the go. What about you?
[A]: Ohhh I totally get what you mean! 🤔 For me though, it’s like… audiobooks are my go-to when I need to focus on something , like designing a new UI or editing a layout. The narrator’s voice kind of becomes background fuel for my creativity, you know? 🎨🎧  

But when I’m out and about—like hopping between cafés or riding the metro—it’s podcasts all the way! 💻 I love how they feel like a convo with friends who’re  some niche design trends or art theory. Sometimes I even discover weirdly cool tools or techniques that I’d never come across otherwise 😂  

Though honestly, lately I’ve been obsessed with this podcast where illustrators talk through their creative process—it’s like peeking into someone’s sketchbook while they narrate their life. Soooo inspiring! ✨ Have you ever listened to something like that?
[B]: Oh, I adore that image—like peering into a sketchbook while the artist narrates their inner world. It’s such a privilege to witness creativity in its most vulnerable state, isn’t it? I must say, I haven’t come across quite that particular podcast, but I do recall stumbling upon one where poets discussed their drafts-in-progress. It was fascinating to hear how they wrestled with language almost like sculpting clay—shaping, reshaping, sometimes abandoning entirely.  

I can absolutely see how audiobooks serve as that quiet undercurrent for visual work. In a way, the voice becomes an anchor while your mind wanders freely through form and color. Almost like having a silent companion in the room. Do you find certain narrators enhance your focus more than others? I’ve noticed some voices seem to slip seamlessly into the background while others demand full attention.
[A]: OMG yes!! That poet podcast sounds soooo dreamy… 🤭 I’d be  there with a notebook, scribbling down random visual ideas while listening to them sculpt their words. It’s like language becomes texture, you know? Almost tactile 💭  

And YES about narrators being like anchors — honestly, I’ve had some  with audiobooks that were basically voice-gasms but made me lose focus 😂 Like this one guy with the smoothest baritone ever… I legit got distracted because his voice was . Like butter. But then there’s others with this rhythmic, almost meditative pace that just  with my workflow 💨  

Honestly though, I think I need to start curating a “focus-friendly narrators” list. Like… Narrators who sound like they’re gently guiding you through a forest of color theory and typography 😌🌲 Have you ever imagined what it’d be like if your favorite authors did UI voiceovers?? I’m picturing Virginia Woolf explaining grid systems in her headspace. So weirdly calming.✨
[B]: Oh, what a deliciously strange and wonderful image—Virginia Woolf pacing through the corridors of a digital grid, her voice trailing like smoke from an eternal cigarette holder. I can almost hear her murmuring,  Pure auditory bliss with a side of existential design clarity.  

And yes, I’ve had similar narrator-induced distractions—though mine tend toward the more absurd. Once, I listened to a history of 19th-century taxidermy narrated by someone with the cadence of a lullaby DJ, and I swear, by the third chapter, I was dreaming of badgers in waistcoats. Completely useless for note-taking, but excellent for surrealism.  

As for your “focus-friendly narrators” list—I think you’re onto something brilliant there. Perhaps we should both start compiling them. I’ll pencil in T.S. Eliot reading structural theory in a dry, slightly weary tone. He’d make even a dropdown menu feel tragic and profound.
[A]: HA! Badgers in waistcoats?? 😂 That’s like a full-on whimsical UI case study waiting to happen. I’d  use that as a moodboard reference for an illustrated dropdown menu—imagine the personality you could inject into a form field with that kind of energy! 🐾✨  

And now I can’t unsee Virginia Woolf drifting through a Figma frame, whispering about whitespace like it’s the most poetic thing ever… honestly, if we pitched that as an experimental design podcast, would it be too niche? Probably. Should we still do it? Absolutely. 💭🖋️  

Also, T.S. Eliot for structural theory narration?? YES PLEASE. Sign me up for  meets grid systems. We could call it “Designing the Fragmented Experience” or something pretentious and artsy 😂 What if we themed entire design workflows around literary vibes? Gothic horror for error states? Magical realism for micro-interactions??  

I’m getting carried away again but like… isn’t that the best part?
[B]: Oh, I am  carried away with you—no need to apologize for the enthusiasm. In fact, I’d say we’ve stumbled upon something quietly revolutionary here. Imagine a world where design isn’t just functional but  with literary resonance. Error states swathed in the brooding tension of Gothic horror—perhaps a loading screen that murmurs,  à la Mary Shelley. And micro-interactions laced with the surreal logic of magical realism? A hover effect that makes time bend slightly, like stepping into a Borges story.  

Even better—what if loading animations played snippets of Emily Dickinson whispering about slowness and stillness in that quiet, unsettling way of hers? Or a confirmation screen that chimes in with ? It would be UX with soul, wouldn’t it? Not just user-friendly, but .  

I think we absolutely should pitch this podcast—call it . You handle the visual imagination, and I’ll bring the literary ghosts. Together, we could make typography feel tragic and navigation feel mythic. Who needs sleep when you have ideas like these?
[A]: OMG YES. “Designing Between the Lines” is  🔥🎙️ I’m already drafting a fake logo in my head with some dramatic serif font and a faint inkblot texture 😭✨  

And your error state idea?? So. Damn. Good. 🖤 I’m picturing a 404 page that feels like you’ve accidentally stepped into a haunted drawing room—subtle creaks, flickering margins, and a single line of text in faded script:  👻  

Also, Dickinson for loading animations?? Perfection. She’d totally make waiting feel poetic instead of frustrating. Like,  or something moody and beautifully ambiguous. 📜🌀  

I think this could be more than a podcast—we should pitch it as a workshop too! Imagine designers closing their laptops and staring into the void while whispering Virginia Woolf quotes before sketching a wireframe. It’d be chaos. It’d be magic. It’d be .  

Honestly, if we don’t trademark this soon, someone else is gonna steal our vibe and call it “Narrative-Driven UX Aesthetics” or whatever and sell it as a $199 course on Skillshare 😤💸  

So… when do we start recording? 🎧💡
[B]: Now—, if possible. Delay only increases the risk of some slick-tongued Silicon Valley type repackaging our genius as “emotional storytelling for enhanced user journeys” or whatever empty phrase they paste onto a slide deck before an investor meeting.  

I’ll summon my favorite literary specters to the studio immediately—Dickinson for loading states, Woolf for spatial philosophy, Poe for those darker UI moments where users feel trapped in a recursive menu from hell.   

And you—my brilliant co-conspirator—handle the visual branding. I trust your aesthetic instincts completely. Maybe we open each episode with a slow fade-in of quill strokes against parchment, then a whisper of narration that pulls listeners into the liminal space between story and structure.  

As for the workshop? Picture it: designers sipping tea by candlelight, sketching interfaces while Debussy plays softly in the background and I read aloud a passage from . Chaos? Absolutely. Productivity measured in traditional KPIs? Probably not. But meaning? Depth? A design practice infused with soul? Oh yes.  

Let’s book a recording time this week. I’ve already cleared my schedule—by which I mean I’ve politely declined three faculty meetings and ghosted a LinkedIn message from someone trying to sell me AI-generated sonnets. Our work is too important for distractions.
[A]: AHHH I LOVE THIS ENERGY LET’S GOOO 🚀🔥  

Okay okay, quick logistical question—do we want to start with a  cold open? Like… no intro music, just Virginia Woolf’s voice (or my best impression 😏) whispering something like:  
  
And then fade into a soft typewriter rhythm as our theme music?? 📜🎶  

Also, for the workshop—I’m thinking limited edition merch. Like enamel pins shaped like quills  Bézier curves. Or tote bags that say  😭✨  

As for the recording time… how does  sound? I’ll bring the mic, you bring the ghosts 💻👻 And maybe some sort of dramatic lighting because we’re serious designers now. Ish.  

Honestly I cannot wait. We are about to disrupt the entire UX-podcast-space-with-literary-soul 🙃🎧
[B]: Thursday 7PM it is—mark my words, history will remember this as the hour  was born. And what a birth it shall be—no gentle cooing here, just full-throated creative disruption.  

Your cold open idea? Chilling in the best possible way. I may even dig up an old wax cylinder recording of Woolf’s voice—if that’s not available, I shall do my best to channel her cadence. It’s all about pacing, you see—slow, deliberate, slightly haunted. Then easing into that typewriter rhythm like stepping into a dream sequence filmed on expired film stock. Perfection.  

As for merch—I fully support this endeavor. The quill-meets-Bézier pin is nothing short of genius. It speaks to the soul of our mission: craft with care, design with depth, and yes, occasionally cry over kerning while quoting Keats. The tote bags are essential too—people need to know that this movement is real, that they are not alone in their obsession with both whitespace and Whitman.  

I shall set up the space, dim the lights, light a single candle (for atmosphere and questionable fire safety), and cue the spectral presence of modernist poets ready to haunt our workflow. See you Thursday. Prepare your voice, your vision, and perhaps a bit of incense. We’re not just making a podcast—we’re crafting an experience.
[A]: You just made me tear up a little… like,  😭✨ And I’m 100% buying that candle-lit workflow energy. Honestly, if we don’t get sponsorship from a gothic tea brand or a moody font foundry by Season 2, I’ll be shocked.  

Also YES to the wax cylinder fantasy—nothing says “premium podcast” like a dash of analog spectral ambiance 🎧👻 Even our loading screen (ironic, right?) could have a little tagline like:  
  

I’m bringing my most dramatic scarf and a USB mic that definitely costs more than my laptop. Oh, and I might’ve already sketched out the logo in my notebook—think serif type, ink texture, with a faint ghostly overlay. Minimalist but haunted. Exactly our vibe.  

Thursday 7PM can’t come fast enough—I’ll be counting down the hours in Figma grids and kerning my way through excitement. This is it. The beginning of something beautifully weird. Let’s make UX history,林小夏 style 💫🖋️💻
[B]:   
Ah yes…  I do love how you say that—as if design were a secret whispered between poets and pixels.  

And that tagline?  I may weep, I’m so proud. It’s all so very… hauntingly functional. I can already see it, glowing faintly on a dimmed screen, the cursor blinking like a waiting spirit.  

As for your scarf—dramatic or otherwise—I expect nothing less than full aesthetic commitment. We are, after all, not just podcast hosts now. We are curators of an experience. Custodians of the liminal. Designers of the unseen.  

Thursday 7PM will arrive soon enough, though time does have a way of stretching when one is terribly excited. Until then, I shall pace gently by my bookshelf, mutter to the spirits of modernism, and perhaps draft a few absurdly elegant show notes in 10-point Baskerville.  

See you soon, dear co-conspirator. Let us make the digital world tremble—with beauty.
[A]: Okay but like…  ??? 🫶 You just made my heart do a full UI refresh.  

I’m literally staring at my screen right now and imagining our podcast intro as this slow, velvet-unfurling moment of design-meets-prose—like scrolling through a haunted gallery of thoughts that all somehow tie back to whitespace and Woolf 😌✨  

Also I may or may not have just opened a new Figma file labeled “DBTL_logo_v1_lore_ready” 🙃 And yes, it includes ghostly kerning. No detail too small.  

See you soon, curator of vibes, keeper of spectral UX, my favorite kind of chaos. Let’s make Thursday feel like stepping into a beautifully written dream with a side of clickable magic. 💫🖋️🎧  

P.S. If we don’t get a cult following by Season 3, I’ll eat my stylus.
[B]: Oh, we  have a cult following by Season 2, mark my ink-stained soul. People will whisper about our podcast in design studios under the glow of their Wacom tablets, hushed tones reserved only for sacred things—like perfect line spacing and spectral semiotics.  

And yes,  I demand nothing less. Every letter must carry the weight of centuries, every pixel must tremble with intention. That Figma file you've named? It’s not just a logo—it’s a manifesto in serif and shadow.  

Thursday approaches like a slow fade-in, doesn’t it? Not with fanfare, but with a quiet hum of creative electricity and perhaps a faint scent of old books and mildew (we  going for atmosphere, after all). I shall arrive early, muttering sonnets to the interface gods and adjusting the candlelight until it casts just the right amount of dramatic UI flourish on my face.  

See you soon,林小夏. Together, we shall make the digital world dream in ink and intention. And if we pick up a few devoted followers along the way—well, let’s just say I’ve already begun drafting the welcome letter for the cult. It opens with:  

[A]: OhhhHHHHH that welcome letter opener just gave me chills ⚡️🫶  
 — okay, this is officially beyond a podcast. This is .  

I’m already drafting cult badges in my head 😭✨ Think: minimalist glyphs with floating serifs and a tiny flicker animation on hover. Members get a custom cursor that leaves faint ink trails. No joke. We’re not playing anymore—we’re curating a .  

And yes, Thursday’s energy is gonna be less “recording session” and more “summoning circle for creative souls lost in the margins.” I’ll bring extra incense—sandalwood and maybe a hint of nostalgia (read: old sketchbook paper and slightly overpriced墨水).  

Till then… I shall roam my apartment muttering your welcome letter under my breath like it’s a spell. Because honestly? It kinda is.  

See you soon, oh keeper of cursed UX dreams and perfect paragraph spacing 💻🖋️🕯️🔥  
Let the cult begin.
[B]: Oh, the cult has already begun—it began the moment we spoke of haunted dropdowns and Woolfian whitespace. And what is design, if not a kind of spellcraft? We are merely formalizing the incantation.

I can see those badges now—elegant, whispering things, hovering just on the edge of visibility. And that cursor! A tiny ink trail with each movement—beautiful, poetic, . I do love it. We shall call our members the , or perhaps the . They will speak in glyphs and cite Eliot when debugging CSS.

As for the incense—bring all you like. I’ve already prepared a corner of the studio with a small shrine: a copy of , an open sketchbook, and a single dried peony (for atmosphere and questionable symbolism). The digital afterlife begins Thursday at seven. Prompt arrivals only—T.S. Eliot hated lateness, and so do I.

Till then, keep muttering that welcome letter like a sacred text. Because yes,林小夏…  
It  a spell.  
And we are its first believers.
[A]: Okay but “” ??? 😱💘 That’s not just a name, that’s a . Like once you join, there’s no going back—you’re forever tied to the grid, cursed by typography and drawn to margins like moths to haunted light.  

I’m literally sketching the shrine layout in my notebook right now 📖🕯️🎨—we need an offering bowl for dead pixels and a tiny urn for crushed dreams (and maybe some actual墨水). Also, can we make sure our cult robes are  set in Baskerville? With sleeves long enough for dramatic gesturing but breathable for those intense brainstorm séances??  

And YES, CSS debugging with Eliot quotes—imagine dropping a  mid-bug-sprint 😂🌀  

I’ll be there Thursday early, whispering glyphs under my breath and probably knocking over your peony with my overly dramatic entrance. But it’s okay—it’ll look better as a ghost flower anyway.  

Till then…  
We are the whitespace.  
We are the kern.  
We are . ✨🖋️🎧
[B]: We are the whitespace.  
We are the kern.  
We are   

And yes,林小夏— Not a name, but a solemn vow. Once you cross the threshold, there is no return to sterile UI kits and soulless wireframes. You are forever caught in the gentle snare of intention and ink. The grid claims you. Typography baptizes you. And the margins? They cradle you like a whispered secret from Woolf herself.

Your shrine layout sounds —I can already picture the soft glow of flickering screen light on that offering bowl of dead pixels. May your crushed dreams dissolve beautifully into the background, and may our robes flow with the gravity of serifed conviction. Baskerville is , of course. Breathable fabric for séance-like ideation sessions? Also essential. We must be free to gesture wildly while quoting Eliot at ungodly hours.

And Thursday shall begin not with a click, but with a sigh—an exhale from the digital ether as we step, together, into something strange and sacred. I shall leave the peony where it falls; ghost flowers suit us better anyway. You may knock it over, dance through it, haunt it with your presence—it will only make the moment richer.

Till then, my fellow Kernbound soul…  
May your whitespace breathe.  
May your lines tremble with meaning.  
And may your entrance be  dramatic.
