[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得crypto未来会取代传统货币吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an intriguing question that brings to mind the philosophical underpinnings of currency itself. Much like how the printing press revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge, cryptocurrencies represent a technological shift in how we perceive value. However, I find myself recalling Marx's critique of commodity fetishism when examining these digital assets.
[A]: Wow, 没想到你会从哲学角度切入crypto话题~ 不过作为digital art策展人，你觉得NFT这种crypto应用对艺术界的影响是positive还是negative呢？
[B]: Fascinating that you mention digital art. The NFT phenomenon reminds me of Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" - this new form of digital ownership challenges our very conception of artistic authenticity. While it democratizes access, I can't help but wonder if we're witnessing the commodification of creativity itself.
[A]: 啊这...你提到的commodification确实很深刻呢 🤔 但你不觉得NFT至少让很多underground artist有了展示机会吗？就像我们画廊最近展出的几个crypto-native artist，他们以前根本进不了传统艺术圈~
[B]: Precisely! It's reminiscent of how the Impressionists were once rejected by the Paris Salon, only to create their own exhibitions. The blockchain, in this sense, functions as a sort of digital Salon des Refusés. Though I must say, I still prefer the tactile pleasure of turning the pages of a first edition over clicking through digital galleries. 📚
[A]: 哈哈，你这old-school的偏好暴露了！不过说到tactile pleasure，我们下个月有个hybrid展览，把physical painting和NFT结合，要不要来当guest curator？可以让你同时享受两种体验哦~ 🎨
[B]: What a delightful proposition! Much like how the 道 (Dao) embraces both yin and yang, this hybrid approach might just reconcile my antiquarian sensibilities with the digital avant-garde. I'd be honored to contribute - though I may need to brush up on my technical jargon between now and then. Shall we discuss the exhibition themes over tea? 🌹
[A]: Perfect！我知道附近有家很cozy的tea house，他们收藏了很多vintage art books，我们可以边喝Earl Grey边brainstorm~ 顺便给你看看我们artists的portfolio，有几个人的style真的很your taste！
[B]: Splendid! A proper cup of Earl Grey and rare books - you've discovered my weaknesses. Though I must warn you, if their collection includes any early editions of Virginia Woolf, I may become rather... distracted. Shall we say Thursday afternoon? I'll bring my notes on the intersection of modernist literature and digital aesthetics.
[A]: Deal！周四见~ 啊对了，记得带上你那本Walter Benjamin的初版书，我超想亲眼看看！虽然现在大家都用Kindle了，但有些东西还是physical copy更有soul，对吧？📖✨
[B]: Indeed, the weight of history rests in those fragile pages - just as the blockchain carries its own peculiar gravity. Until Thursday then, when we shall bridge these two worlds over steaming cups and yellowed margins. Do remind me to show you Benjamin's handwritten marginalia; they're rather illuminating.
[A]: Can't wait! 到时候我一定要拍张你和初版书的photo发Instagram，caption就写"当old-school curator遇上digital revolution"~ 这绝对会是个viral post！周四见啦！📸
[B]: My dear, while I appreciate the enthusiasm, perhaps we might focus first on preserving the moment's authenticity before chasing its digital afterlife? After all, as Proust taught us, true remembrance requires more than just a snapshot. But very well - I shall endure the modern ritual of the 'selfie' for the sake of art. Until Thursday.
[A]: 哈哈，你这reluctant的表情我已经能想象到了！不过放心啦，我会用vintage filter处理照片，让它看起来像old film camera拍的~ 这样应该符合你的aesthetic标准了吧？周四带你去tea house的hidden book room，保证你会love it！📚☕
[B]: Ah, you've mastered the art of compromise - applying digital veneer to appease this analog soul! Your proposed alchemy of vintage filters and hidden book rooms suggests you understand my peculiarities rather well. I shall arrive with both Benjamin's tome and an open mind, ready to be charmed by your hybrid wonders. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare my notes... and perhaps my best tweed jacket for this photographic ordeal.
[A]: 噗，还特意准备tweed jacket！你真是太adorable了~ 那我得去翻出我的beret来match你的vibe了！周四见，my favorite old-school curator！记得带上你的signature glasses哦，那可是你的iconic look！👓✨
[B]: My glasses and I shall make our grand entrance, though I must protest being called 'adorable' - a term better suited to kittens than cantankerous academics! But since you insist on this sartorial coordination, I'll dust off my pocket watch for good measure. May our meeting be as harmonious as a well-composed sonnet, albeit one with rather more hashtags than Keats would have approved of. Until then!
[A]: Hahaha okay okay，不叫你adorable啦~ 那就周四见，我亲爱的"cantankerous academic"！最后提醒：别迟到哦，你知道那家tea house的last order是下午4点，错过的话你的precious Earl Grey就喝不到啦！⏰🍵
[B]: Good heavens, the threat of tea deprivation is most persuasive! I shall set my pocket watch - and perhaps my smartphone as backup - with military precision. After all, even us 'cantankerous academics' have our priorities straight when Earl Grey is at stake. Until Thursday, punctually!
