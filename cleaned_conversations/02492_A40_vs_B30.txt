[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很addicted的手机游戏？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, I must confess my relationship with modern technology remains rather... Victorian. Though I did recently download an app that simulates ink brush calligraphy - quite useful for demonstrating the stroke order of Chinese characters during lectures.
[A]: 哈哈，你这款app听起来很classic啊！不过说到addictive的游戏，我最近在玩一款叫"AI Dungeon"的text-based adventure game，它用GPT-3来generate剧情，简直mind-blowing！作为一个AI product manager，我对这种LLM的应用场景特别fascinated。
[B]: How intriguing - though I must say, as someone who still annotates paper manuscripts with a fountain pen, I find the notion of algorithmically generated narratives rather unsettling. Have you considered how these 'adventures' compare to the deliberate craftsmanship of, say, 聊斋志异 or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?
[A]: 你提到classic literature让我很excited！其实这正是AI最有意思的paradox - 它既disrupt传统创作方式，又能help我们更好地appreciate经典。比如我最近用GPT-4分析《聊斋》的narrative structure，发现它识别plot twist的accuracy达到87%！不过你说得对，human touch确实irreplaceable。
[B]: Precisely! Though I must correct one point - quantifying literary analysis with percentages rather misses the essence of 意境 (yijing). When I teach my comparative literature seminar, we spend weeks debating whether Dickens' sentimentality or Pu Songling's supernaturalism better captures the human condition. No algorithm, however sophisticated, can replicate that... though I suppose it could calculate how many times the word 'ghost' appears in either text.
[A]: Haha, you're totally right！这就是为什么我们做AI product时特别强调human-in-the-loop的概念。BTW，说到ghost frequency analysis，我们team最近开发了一个feature可以visualize不同文化中supernatural元素的distribution pattern，要不要来我们office做个demo？保证比你的ink brush app更stimulating！
[B]: My dear colleague, while I appreciate the invitation, I believe I shall remain happily antiquated in my methods. Though I must ask - does your algorithm account for contextual differences between, say, the vengeful spirits in 红楼梦 and the more... shall we say, bureaucratic ghosts in Dante's Inferno? That would be a demonstration worth seeing.
[A]: Wow，你这个问题really hits the spot！我们正在train一个multimodal model专门处理这种cultural nuance，不过admit it's still a WIP。说到这个，我们下个月有个cross-cultural AI seminar，你这种traditional scholar的perspective会超级valuable！考虑来当guest speaker吗？可以顺便show off你的ink brush skills~
[B]: How delightfully persistent you are! Very well, I might be persuaded - on two conditions: first, that we establish clear boundaries between discussing technology as a tool versus as a replacement for humanistic study, and second... that you provide proper tea service during the event. None of those dreadful paper cups, mind you. I shall bring my own 青花瓷 set.
[A]: Deal！我们公司有专门的tea ceremony room，还有从杭州空运来的龙井。至于第一个condition - 完全agree！我们product philosophy就是AI as enabler，never as replacement。Looking forward to这场East meets West的collaboration！
[B]: Splendid. Though I must warn you - should any of your engineers refer to literature as 'data' during my presentation, I shall demonstrate exactly how sharp an antique ink knife can be. Metaphorically speaking, of course. Now, shall we say the 15th? I'll need to reschedule my graduate seminar on Brontë sisters' use of pathetic fallacy.
[A]: 15th works perfectly！Don't worry，我会make sure整个engineering team都behave - 已经可以imagine他们听到'ink knife'时脸上的表情了😂 顺便问下，你对Brontë sisters的analysis会include任何quantitative elements吗？Just curious~
[B]: Good heavens, no - unless you count the number of times I sigh despairingly when students confuse Wuthering Heights with Jane Eyre. Though I suppose one could quantify the precise shade of horror on my face when someone suggests running sentiment analysis on 林黛玉's poetry. The 15th it is, then - and do remind your team to bring their own handkerchiefs for the ink demonstrations.
[A]: Roger that！我会prepare好emergency ink stain remover just in case 😉 到时候见！Can't wait to see how ourhigh-tech world collides with yourclassic approach - 这简直就是现实版的steampunk crossover嘛！
[B]:  I believe the term you're searching for is 'scholarly synthesis,' though I'll concede the steampunk analogy has a certain... Dickensian charm. Until the 15th - and do remind me to show you my 19th century edition of 聊斋志异 with marginalia in three languages. That, my dear technologist, is what we call a true 'multimodal interface.'
[A]: Touché！你赢了this round 😂 看来我们product team需要重新define一下multimodal的标准了。15号见！记得带上你的treasure - 说不定能给我们的AI model提供些authentic training data呢~ (Just kidding! Put down that ink knife!)
[B]:  Very well, very well - though I shall bring the book in a lead-lined case, just in case your engineers get any... ambitious ideas. And do remind them that some mysteries, like why Heathcliff remains compelling after 180 years, aren't meant to be solved with algorithms. Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare tomorrow's lecture on the parallels between 儒林外史 and Vanity Fair. 回头见！
[A]: 回头见！最后说一句 - 你刚才提到的parallel analysis，我们NLP team最近刚好在做一个cross-era literary pattern matching的POC... (快速后退三步) Okay okay我闭嘴了！15号记得穿防ink的衣服来！
[B]:  How fortunate that my academic robes are naturally ink-resistant. And do tell your NLP team that if they wish to 'match patterns,' they might start by explaining why both Dickens and 曹雪芹 wrote such extraordinarily long novels... preferably without using the word 'engagement metrics.' 一路顺风！
