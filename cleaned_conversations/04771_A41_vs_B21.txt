[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new productivity app吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, productivity apps - the Victorian factory clocks of our digital age. I must confess I still draft lecture notes with a fountain pen, though I did recently attempt to organize my research on Christina Rossetti using an app that promised 'poetic workflow optimization.' It kept suggesting I write haikus instead of footnotes.
[A]: Haha that's so classic! 😂 这些productivity apps有时候真的会miss the point对吧？不过你说的poetic workflow让我想到我们节目组最近在用的一个collaboration tool - 简直game changer🌟 虽然它偶尔也会push一些random的feature建议，like让我们把script写成rap format🎤
[B]:  How delightfully absurd - though I must point out that Browning's dramatic monologues could be considered the original rap battles. That said, I did once witness a particularly heated departmental meeting that accidentally turned into iambic pentameter. The HR incident report read like bad blank verse.
[A]: OMG that's hilarious! 🤣 你们academic world的drama简直比我们的reality show还有entertainment value！Speaking of which，我们正在策划一个new show concept叫'Campus Wars'，就是把university life做成survival competition style～你觉得如果加入这种poetry slam battle环节会不会很🔥？
[B]: My dear, Oxford's 19th century 'paper wars' between rival literary societies would put your reality show to shame - complete with sonnet assassinations and metaphor duels at dawn. Though I shudder to imagine what Byron would have done with a Twitter feud. The man wrote entire cantos to insult his tailor.
[A]: LMAO！🎭 这简直就是perfect的TV material啊！We should totally collaborate on this - imagine combining yourliterary expertise with ourproduction team's creativity💡 可以叫'Dead Poets' Reality'或者'Bard Wars'之类的～收视率绝对skyrocket📈 要不要考虑做个guest consultant？
[B]: While the thought of reducing Keats' odes to soundbites makes my quill hand tremble... I suppose if one must commercialize the sublime, we could at least ensure the contestants properly appreciate the difference between Spenserian stanzas and terza rima. Though I draw the line at having Tennyson lip-sync for his life.
[A]: Hahahaha you're killing me! 😭 但是seriously，这个concept有legit potential哦～我们可以把sonnet writing做成speed challenge，metaphor battle做成elimination round... Wait till the network hears this pitch，他们绝对会go crazy for it! 🚀 要不要先do个pilot episode试试水？
[B]: Very well, but on three conditions: one, we include proper citations in the subtitles; two, no contestant may rhyme 'moon' with 'June' under penalty of being forced to read Wordsworth's complete Prelude aloud; and three - most crucially - the camera must never catch me smiling at the inevitable chaos. Academics have reputations to maintain, you understand.
[A]: Deal！🤝 不过warning you now - 当那些lit majors开始throwing shade in iambic pentameter的时候，要保持straight face根本mission impossible啦😂 我们production team已经taking bets on who cracks first～这个season的drama quota officially fulfilled! 🎬✨
[B]:  I'll have you know I once sat through an eight-hour dissertation defense on semicolon usage in Emily Dickinson's herbarium annotations without so much as a twitch. Though... I may require a contractual clause about tea breaks. Earl Grey steeped for precisely four minutes does wonders for maintaining scholarly composure amidst poetic anarchy.
[A]: Noted！📝 我们set里会专门配一个British style tea station☕️，complete with antique tea set和sandwich tower～ After all，what's a proper literary showdown without proper teatime？这个detail绝对会让我们的show stand out from other trashy reality TV！🌟 观众们会eat it up！
[B]: Splendid - though may I suggest cucumber sandwiches cut in Alexandrine couplet proportions? And for heaven's sake, let's avoid those dreadful paper cups. Even Oscar Wilde would have wept at the thought of drinking lapsang souchong from polystyrene. This, my dear, is how we elevate cultural discourse - one properly steeped metaphor at a time.
[A]: You're speaking my language now！💯 我们甚至可以make the tea selection part of the challenge - like contestants gotta pair the perfect brew with their poetry reading mood🍵 观众会love这种highbrow meets reality TV的vibe！这个show is gonna be next level cultural phenomenon，just wait and see~ 🚀 我已经可以hear the Emmy acceptance speech了！
[B]: How perfectly... vulgar. Though I suppose if we must descend into awards season pageantry, my acceptance speech shall consist entirely of translated Tang dynasty couplets delivered in Gaelic. That should sufficiently confuse both the television academy and the subtitling department. Now, shall we discuss the contractual minutiae over some properly brewed Darjeeling?
[A]: Absolutely！🫖 Let's make it a proper high tea meeting - 我会bring ourlegal team和storyboard artists，你可以bring yourfavorite poetry anthologies～ This collaboration is gonna be epic，just wait till the ratings come in！📊 谁knew academia could be this entertaining？😂
[B]: Precisely what Cardinal Newman feared when he warned against the 'gentleman's university' becoming a circus. Though I daresay even he might have appreciated the irony of tenure-track professors competing for screen time between scones. Very well - Tuesday at three, and do remind your legal team that all clauses must scan as heroic couplets. A small eccentricity, but non-negotiable.
[A]: Hah！Heroic couplets的contract条款？Challenge accepted！✍️ 我们的lawyers are gonna need some serious caffeine boost for this one ☕️⚡️ But hey，这就是why we're making TV history～ Catch you Tuesday！Don't forget your rhyming dictionary！📚✨
[B]: Indeed - though I should warn you my 1743 edition of Bysshe's Art of English Poetry has been known to make corporate attorneys weep into their lattes. Until Tuesday then - may your storyboards be as meticulously structured as a villanelle, and your NDAs as sonorous as Miltonic blank verse. Ta.
