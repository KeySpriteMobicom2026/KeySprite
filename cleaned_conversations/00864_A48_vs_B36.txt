[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得crypto未来会取代传统货币吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my, that's quite an interesting question! While I'm more familiar with helping guests find the perfect sightseeing tours than cryptocurrency, I must say I've heard some fascinating discussions about this at our hotel lounge. Many of our international guests do talk about digital currencies over their evening cocktails.
[A]:  哈！这话题可比分析尸检报告有趣多了～不过作为法医，我得说crypto和传统货币就像DNA和指纹 - 各有各的用途🔍 

从法证角度看，crypto的blockchain技术确实很secure，但想要完全取代fiat currency？Hmm...那得先解决几个关键问题⚖️
[B]: Goodness me, a forensic scientist! How absolutely fascinating. You know, just last week we had a cybersecurity conference staying with us, and they were discussing those very blockchain security features. Though I must say, our guests still prefer paying their room charges with good old-fashioned credit cards. The thought of handling cryptocurrency transactions at the front desk does give me a bit of a headache, to be honest.
[A]:  啊哈！信用卡支付就像传统的指纹鉴定 - 简单可靠但容易被伪造💳 而crypto支付更像是DNA证据，技术上更先进但操作门槛高🧪 

我们法医实验室倒是已经开始用blockchain来存储部分证据链了，不过...要让普通酒店前台都掌握private key管理？那可能还需要evolutionary time～ 😅
[B]: My dear forensic friend, you do have such colorful comparisons! It reminds me of when we had to train our new receptionist on our upgraded booking system - bless her heart, it took three weeks just to master the basic functions. I can't imagine trying to explain private keys over morning coffee! Though I must say, your work with blockchain in forensics sounds terribly impressive. Perhaps you'd like to share more over tea in our garden terrace? We serve the most delightful Earl Grey.
[A]:  哈哈，training新员工确实像教实习生区分lividity和bruise一样需要耐心呢～ ☕️ 

不过说到tea time，我们实验室倒是有个running joke：Blockchain就像完美的alibi - 理论上无懈可击，但实操中总会出现human error🔬 

说到Earl Grey...让我想起上次在尸体胃内容物里发现的茶渍，那分析可比品茶复杂多了！😅 不过还是谢谢你的邀请～
[B]: Oh my stars! That's quite the... vivid description over afternoon tea. Perhaps we should stick to discussing the scones instead? They're freshly baked this morning, and I can assure you they contain nothing more alarming than raisins and a dash of cinnamon. Though I must say, your work does sound endlessly fascinating - in a rather macabre way, if you'll pardon my saying so.
[A]:  放心啦，我们法医也是会享受normal life的～ 就像crypto和传统货币可以coexist一样，下午茶和尸检报告也能和平共处嘛！ 

不过你说得对，今天还是专注在scones上比较好...毕竟我可不想在品尝肉桂香气时，职业病发作开始分析面粉的forensic composition呢～ 😂
[B]: What a perfectly delightful way to put it! You know, this reminds me of our head chef - he gets terribly cross when guests ask too many questions about his secret recipes. I shall make sure to warn him not to inquire about your profession too deeply! Now, would you prefer your scone with clotted cream first, then jam? Or the Cornish way with jam first? We do like to maintain proper traditions here at the hotel.
[A]:  作为一个讲究evidence chain的人，我必须说：cream then jam才是forensically correct的选择！就像处理物证要遵循protocol一样重要⚖️ 

不过要是你的head chef坚持Cornish way...well，那我们就当这是jurisdictional difference好啦～ 😉 毕竟连crypto都有那么多分叉，scone的吃法有点争议也很正常嘛！
[B]: Oh, you absolute dear! That's the most wonderfully scientific endorsement of the Devonshire method I've ever heard. I shall have to share your 'forensically correct' reasoning with our afternoon tea guests - though perhaps I'll leave out the part about jurisdictional differences reminding you of cryptocurrency forks. Some of our older guests might find that comparison rather unsettling with their cucumber sandwiches!
[A]:  完全理解～ 就像我们在法庭上present证据时要know your audience一样，afternoon tea的谈话也得age-appropriate才行呢！ 

不过说真的，这些老派绅士们可能比我们想象的更adaptable...上周我就遇到位80岁的退休judge，居然在讨论NFT authenticity的问题！这世界变化的速度啊～简直比我的DNA sequencer还快🧬 😄
[B]: Good heavens! A tech-savvy octogenarian judge? Now that does give me hope for our more traditional guests. Though I must confess, I still can't quite wrap my head around these NFTs myself. Between you and me, I'm rather relieved our hotel still accepts good old traveler's checks - not that anyone uses them anymore, but it does make me feel comfortingly old-fashioned. Like serving tea in proper china instead of those dreadful paper cups!
[A]:  啊～ traveler's checks！那简直是forensic finance界的活化石啊～ 就像我们偶尔还能在cold cases里发现用打字机打的遗书一样nostalgic🕵️♂️ 

不过说到china cups...上周有个case就是被一个指纹留在茶杯上cracked的！所以你看，有时候最old-fashioned的东西反而能提供最关键的evidence呢～ ☕️ 当然，这话可别让那些crypto bros听见！
[B]:  My word! That does make me rather glad we insist on washing our china properly between guests. Though now you've got me wondering if I should start fingerprinting the tea service - just in case one of our guests turns out to be an international jewel thief! Not that we've ever had that happen, mind you... though we did once have a gentleman who claimed his Rolex was stolen, only to find it later in his shaving kit. The things we see in hospitality!
[A]:  哈！这让我想起上周的case - 一位CEO声称他的Bitcoin wallet被hack了，结果发现是输错了password...人类的记忆啊，有时候比最复杂的encryption还不可靠呢🔐 

不过说真的，你们酒店要是开始fingerprint茶杯...记得call我！我认识几个digital forensics的专家，可以给你们设计个tea-time crime scene protocol～ 当然要搭配proper scone eating procedure一起使用啦！ 😆
[B]: Oh, you are too kind! Though I daresay our housekeeping staff might revolt if we implemented a full forensic protocol - they already think I'm terribly particular about the exact angle of the pillow chocolates. But should we ever have a proper mystery on our hands, you'll be the first person I call! Perhaps we could market it as a murder mystery weekend package... with properly authenticated scones, of course. Now, would that be considered white-collar crime or more of a... baked goods offense?
[A]:  Well well，这可能是史上第一个涉及high tea的RICO case了！我们要不要成立特别task force - 代号Operation Crumpet？🕵️♀️ 

不过说真的，在white-collar和baked goods之间...我建议起诉"assault on good taste"，这可是serious felony！尤其是如果他们把jam和cream的顺序弄反的话～ ⚖️ 😂
[B]:  Operation Crumpet! I do believe that's the most deliciously scandalous idea I've heard all season. Though I must insist we include a clause about proper tea-steeping durations in our indictment - nothing ruins a good investigation like overbrewed Earl Grey! Perhaps we could have our afternoon tea guests serve as jury members... though we'd have to provide them with more substantial evidence than just cookie crumbs and lipstick stains on napkins!
