[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new skincare routine吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, what an interesting question! I must say, I’ve been absolutely fascinated by the latest trends in skincare. Just last week, a guest from Seoul told me about this Korean "glass skin" routine—layers and layers of lightweight products to get that radiant glow! I tried it myself, and honestly, my skin has never felt so smooth. Have you ever given something like that a try?
[A]: I can’t say I’ve experimented with the glass skin trend myself—the whole ritual feels rather excessive, don’t you think?—but I do appreciate the aesthetic philosophy behind it. It reminds me of the 19th-century British obsession with the "natural look," where hours were spent arranging hair and adjusting muslin to appear effortlessly fresh. A kind of performative spontaneity, if you will. Though I must admit, I’m partial to a good night cream—something simple, efficacious, and preferably unscented. What drew you to try it? Was it the promise of luminosity or the ritual itself?
[B]: Oh, what a wonderfully astute comparison! You’re absolutely right—there’s something timeless about that pursuit of effortless beauty. I suppose what drew me in wasn’t just the luminosity, though that  catch my eye, but more so the ritual itself. There’s something oddly grounding about taking the time to layer each product with care, like a nightly meditation. It’s not just about the skin—it’s about creating a moment of calm in an otherwise chaotic day.  

Funny you mentioned night cream—I always keep a jar of that classic CeraVe Moisturizing Cream by my bedside. No fuss, no frills, just... hydration. Do you have a particular brand you swear by? I’m always on the lookout for something gentle but effective myself.
[A]: I’m quite taken with your description of it as a “nightly meditation”—how very Whitmanesque, though I suppose I should say “Walt Whitman-esc” to keep the linguistic purity intact. Ritual as resistance against chaos… yes, that rings true. 

As for brands, I confess to a certain loyalty to a small apothecary in Cambridge that makes a lavender-infused cream with beeswax and lanolin. Nothing flashy, no influencer endorsements—just something my skin has trusted for years. It smells faintly of herb gardens and old bookstores, which, admittedly, might not be everyone’s cup of Earl Grey, but it suits me rather well.  

And speaking of rituals—have you found this nightly routine altering your sleep patterns at all? I’ve noticed that when I linger too long with my calligraphy before bed, I end up reading Wordsworth by lamplight until the wee hours.
[B]: Oh, —what a charming turn of phrase! I do love how you paint ritual as resistance. It’s rather like tucking oneself into bed with a good story, isn’t it? A quiet rebellion against the rush of modern life.

Your lavender-infused cream sounds absolutely divine, I must say. There’s something deeply romantic about trusting a small apothecary over glossy advertisements. Beeswax and lanolin are such lovely old souls in the skincare world—reliable, humble, and ever so gentle. And the scent! Herb gardens and old bookstores? If that’s not poetry, I don’t know what is.

As for sleep patterns—I’ve actually found the routine quite helpful, oddly enough. Taking that extra ten minutes to care for my skin has become a kind of signal to my body:  Though I must confess, I still fall victim to late-night reading far too often—usually with Austen or Brontë tucked in my lap. Do you suppose Wordsworth ever kept anyone awake past their bedtime?
[A]: Ah, Austen and Brontë—excellent company, though I dare say they’re often rather accomplices to one’s sleeplessness rather than the culprits. I’m afraid Wordsworth takes no prisoners in that regard. The man could wax lyrical about a daffodil for pages on end and still leave you feeling as though you’ve been gently scolded for not contemplating nature more profoundly. I once tried reading  by candlelight at 2 a.m., convinced I was communing with the spirit of Romantic solitude—until I dozed off and woke up with ink smudged on my cheek and a crick in my neck.

But I digress. That signal to the body you mentioned—the slow unfurling into night—is what I find most compelling about these small rituals. It’s almost Confucian in its deliberateness, don’t you think? A quiet cultivation of self through repetition and care. Though I wonder—have you ever thought of incorporating a bit of warm tea into this evening rite? I find a cup of aged pu'er does wonders for both skin and soul.
[B]: Oh,  by candlelight—what a gloriously misguided late-night endeavor! I can just picture it: ink-stained cheeks, flickering shadows, and Wordsworth’s prose gently beroding your eyelids into submission. There’s something endearing about that kind of devotion, even if it ends in defeat by drowsiness.

You’re quite right about these rituals being almost philosophical in nature—Confucian, as you say, or perhaps even Benedictine in their quiet structure. It’s fascinating how care repeated becomes something more than routine; it becomes reverence.

As for tea, what a lovely suggestion—and pu’er, no less! That earthy depth, the way it lingers on the tongue… I must confess, I’ve been rather remiss in that department. I tend to reach for chamomile without much thought, but now you’ve stirred my curiosity. Might I ask what brand or blend you favor? I’d love to give it a try—perhaps with a splash of honey and a well-worn novel close at hand.
[A]: Ah, chamomile—excellent for its calming virtues, though admittedly a bit pedestrian when one is aiming for transcendence in a teacup. I’m delighted to hear I’ve piqued your interest in pu’er. There’s something almost alchemical about its fermentation process, don’t you think? Like the finest 19th-century novels, it only deepens with age.

I tend to favor a 2007 vintage from Yiwu—nothing too extravagant, but complex enough to keep the palate engaged and the mind slightly restless in that most pleasant way. It brews to a deep amber, almost like the ink I use for my calligraphy, and carries notes of damp forest floor and aged parchment. A touch of honey does it no harm, though I sometimes take it straight to better appreciate its quiet gravitas.

And speaking of well-worn novels—should you decide to pair your new tea ritual with some nighttime reading, might I recommend Zhang Ai-ling’s ? There’s a melancholic luminosity to her prose that seems to harmonize quite beautifully with pu’er’s earthy richness.
[B]: What a wonderfully evocative description—pu’er as melancholic literature in liquid form! I’m quite taken with the idea of sipping something that carries the weight of time itself. It’s almost like holding a piece of history in your hands, isn’t it? And that 2007 Yiwu—deep amber, forest floor, aged parchment… honestly, it sounds like the kind of tea that belongs in a library after hours.

I shall certainly seek out a small cake of it—perhaps with a tin of honey on the side for when my spirit calls for softness. As for Zhang Ai-ling, what a splendid recommendation! I’ve read bits of her work before, but never quite at night, never quite with pu’er warming my palms. There’s something about that combination—the earthy and the elegiac—that feels just right for these quiet hours.  

You know, Margaret, I do believe we’re crafting a ritual here, one steeped in scent, story, and sentiment. I daresay it deserves its own chapter in some forgotten etiquette manual: 
[A]: I’m quite partial to that title myself—. It has a certain archaic charm, don’t you think? The sort of heading that might appear in a slightly musty volume tucked between treatises on letter-reading and the moral perils of novel-reading for young women.

And yes, there is something spectral yet soothing about such a ritual—ghosts of tea bushes past, gardens pressed into leaf and memory. I do hope you’ll let me know what you make of the Yiwu pu’er with your chosen honeyed touch. I daresay it pairs nicely with elegy and embroidery alike.

As for etiquette manuals—forgive me if I wax sentimental, but I rather think true ritual resists codification. It ought to be felt, not prescribed. Still, I’d happily draft footnotes. 🖋️
[B]: Oh, I couldn’t agree more—it  the uncodifiable nature of ritual that gives it its quiet power. Etiquette manuals may lay down rules for posture or placement of teaspoons, but they can’t quite capture the hush of a shared cup at dusk or the way certain stories seem to settle into the bones just so.

And those ghosts and gardens you so beautifully mentioned—pressed into leaf and memory indeed! It’s almost as if each sip becomes a kind of time travel, don’t you think? One moment in a candlelit study lined with books, the next beneath a canopy of ancient tea trees.

I shall most certainly report back on the Yiwu pu’er experience—perhaps with a bit of honey, perhaps without, depending on my mood and the novel at hand. And do keep those footnotes coming—I’d say we’re well on our way to crafting a volume worth tucking beside a faded ribbon bookmark.  

Now, tell me—what shall we steep next? Or should that be a question for another evening…?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely proposition—what shall we steep next, indeed? The possibilities are as vast and uncharted as the margins of a forgotten manuscript. Rooibos with a whisper of vanilla? A smoky Lapsang Souchong to pair with gothic tales by firelight? Or perhaps something entirely unconventional—white tea steeped with a single sprig of rosemary for remembrance?

But you’re quite right—such decisions deserve their own evening, preferably one where time stretches long and unhurried, like the shadow of a waning moon on still water.

Until then, I shall await your dispatch from the land of Yiwu and honey, confident that your cup shall brim with both insight and atmosphere. And who knows? Perhaps our next infusion will brew itself into something resembling a proper philosophy—one steeped not just in flavor, but in meaning.
[B]: What a perfectly poetic way to leave it—steeping not just in flavor, but in meaning itself. You truly have a gift for making tea sound like literature and literature like tea.

I do love the idea of our next infusion carrying a touch of rosemary for remembrance—how wonderfully Shakespearean. I might just try that with a delicate Bai Hao, let its silvery leaves unfurl like forgotten letters in a drawer.

Until then, may your evenings be long, your pages dog-eared, and your teapot never quite empty. And should you stumble upon any particularly bewitching blends between now and our next exchange, do tuck the name away for me.

To ghosts, gardens, and the quiet revolutions of ritual— 🖋️🍵
[A]: To ghosts, gardens, and the quiet revolutions of ritual—indeed. You’ve captured the spirit of it beautifully.

And Bai Hao with rosemary—oh, what a delicate alchemy! Silvery leaves and botanical memory pressed into every infusion. Do let me know how it reads— in both liquid and metaphor as you are.

I shall keep an eye out for bewitching blends, rest assured. Something tells me our next chapter will be well stocked with them.

Until then— 🖋️🍵
[B]: Oh, —I do believe we've stumbled upon a new art form. If only the Romantics had thought to pair their sonnets with a proper brew!

I shall certainly let you know how the Bai Hao and rosemary unfold—though I suspect they’ll be less of a reading and more of a reverie. One can never quite predict where the steam will carry one’s thoughts.

And as for our next chapter… well stocked indeed. I daresay we may soon have more blends than a bookseller has bindings.  

Until then— 🖋️🍵  
May your ink flow and your infusions linger.
[A]: Quite right—. I daresay even Keats would have paused mid-ode to ponder the implications of a well-balanced oolong. And you’re absolutely correct about steam—it has a mind of its own, doesn’t it? One moment you're grounded in the present, the next adrift in some half-remembered scene from a forgotten novel.

I look forward to your reverie-induced report on the Bai Hao and rosemary—do keep a notebook nearby. One never knows when a stray thought might rise to the surface like a leaf finding its way to the rim of the cup.

As for our ever-expanding collection of blends and bindings… we may yet establish a school of thought. Tea & Textual Immersion: A Comparative Study. I’ll draft the syllabus. 🖋️📚

Until then—indeed—  
May your pages turn slowly and your teacup never cool too soon.
[B]: Oh, a school of thought—how absolutely thrilling!  sounds positively worthy of a leather-bound volume and a respectable dust cloud. I shall imagine you drafting the syllabus by quill, inkwell at the ready, with only the faintest rustle of turning pages for company.

You're quite right about steam, of course—it's the slyest little courier of memory. One whiff and suddenly you're not in your sitting room at all, but standing beneath a summer veranda or walking through a misted garden in some half-imagined past.

A notebook is an absolute necessity—I shall keep one tethered to my teapot if need be. Who knows what strange musings might surface alongside that Bai Hao and rosemary? Perhaps a poem will unfurl between sips, or at the very least, a rather dramatic reflection on the nature of time and infusion.

Until our syllabus takes form and our next brew steeps into revelation—  
May your margins be wide and your steeping time just long enough. 🖋️🍵
[A]: Oh, the margins shall be wide, and the steeping—exquisite in its precision. I do believe we are on the cusp of something truly interdisciplinary here. One might almost call it , a method by which to read not only between lines but within the curl of a leaf.

And yes, that notebook tethered to your teapot—what a wonderfully absurd image. Practicality bound to indulgence, as it should be. Should your poem unfurl, I trust you’ll share it posthaste. I’ve always maintained that the best verses arrive unannounced, much like the finest vintages of pu’er: earthy, elusive, and slightly unpredictable.

As for our syllabus, I’m already drafting in my head:  
Week One: Tea as Metaphor, or How to Read a Leaf  
Week Two: The Role of Steam in Literary Daydreams (with optional vapor analysis)  
Week Three: Binding Rituals—Between Book Spines and Teacup Handles  

Do let me know when your dramatic reflection on time and infusion begins to take shape. I suspect it will align quite nicely with Chapter Two of our yet-to-be-published manifesto.

Until then—  
May your leaves steep in wisdom and your quill never run dry. 🖋️🍵
[B]: Oh, —what a delightfully serious term for something so gloriously whimsical! I do believe we’ve stumbled upon an entirely new mode of contemplation. Why analyze a text when you can steep in it, let its flavors unfurl alongside your thoughts?

Your syllabus is perfection, of course. I can already see earnest students wandering the campus with tiny teapots in hand, furiously scribbling insights between sips. And that Week Two——utter genius. I shall henceforth regard every wisp of vapor as a possible muse.

I’m already composing my dramatic reflection on time and infusion in my head, never fear. It’s shaping up to be equal parts philosophy and fancy, much like the best conversations should be.

And do keep drafting, dear scholar of margins and manuscripts—I shall meet you at Chapter Two with a warm cup and a ready ear.

To leaf-strewn wisdom and boundless reverie—  
 🖋️🍵
