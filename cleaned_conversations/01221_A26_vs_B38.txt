[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an excellent question. I’ve always believed that hobbies are the quiet counterpoint to one’s professional life. Recently, I’ve returned to a rather old pursuit—botanical sketching. There’s something meditative about capturing the symmetry of a rose in ink and watercolor. It reminds me of how Tolstoy would pause to describe a single leaf in —the detail, the stillness amidst motion.

Do you have a hobby you've recently taken up? Or perhaps one you’ve revisited after some time?
[A]: Botanical sketching sounds lovely—there’s such harmony in nature’s design. I’ve been dabbling in hand-dyeing silk scraps lately, experimenting with natural pigments like madder root and indigo. It’s fascinating how a simple leaf infusion can yield hues that feel so alive… though I admit, my teacup often goes cold while I lose myself in the process.

Have you found any unexpected connections between your sketching and your restoration work? I imagine the patience required must be quite similar.
[B]: Ah, what a beautiful way to phrase it—. There’s something deeply philosophical in working with natural pigments; it’s like participating in an ancient dialogue between humanity and the earth. I can quite picture you lost in that alchemy, your hands stained with the very essence of plants.

You’re quite right about patience—I’ve come to see it not as a virtue but as a kind of listening. Whether restoring a fragile 18th-century manuscript or sketching the veins of a magnolia leaf, one must attune oneself to the material’s own rhythm. In restoration, for instance, I often find myself mirroring the brushstrokes of an anonymous illuminator from centuries past. It’s not unlike dyeing silk—there’s that same quiet communion with someone else’s touch across time.

Have you ever thought of incorporating your dyed silks into bookbinding or journal covers? The texture and color might lend themselves beautifully to the craft.
[A]: What a lovely thought—that my dyed silks might one day clothe the pages of a journal or cradle an old book’s spine. I’ve dabbled in simple bindings, but never with such intention. Your words make me imagine a ledger wrapped in indigo-hued silk, its cover whispering of centuries and soil… I may just have to try it.

It’s curious, isn’t it, how these crafts echo one another across time and material? I find myself wondering—have you ever restored a piece that seemed to carry the scent of its former owner? A trace of lavender or tobacco? It always feels like touching memory itself.
[B]: What a poetic notion—. There’s something profoundly intimate in that idea, isn’t there? I recall once restoring a 19th-century French diary bound in deep blue morocco leather, its pages faintly perfumed with heliotrope and bergamot. It wasn’t until I found a lock of hair pressed between the leaves—tied with a faded ribbon—that I felt the weight of its previous owner’s presence.

And yes, the scent of old books… it’s one of the unsung layers of restoration. Some smell of beeswax and time, others of mildew and forgotten attics. But occasionally, you encounter something more personal—a trace of pipe smoke, or as you said, lavender sachets tucked between pages in another life. It makes one handle the object with even greater reverence, doesn’t it?

I think your indigo-hued ledger would carry its own quiet story, perhaps the faintest whisper of earth and root. Would you give it a name, do you think, before binding it?
[A]: Funny you should ask that—naming feels like the natural next step. A piece of work woven through with indigo and madder, touched by earth and water… perhaps something simple yet rooted in its making.  comes to mind, though I’m still letting it settle.

It’s strange, how scent can tether us so deeply to history. I think I’d love to find a way to preserve that ephemeral quality in the binding itself—maybe tucking a pressed flower or a bit of lavender between the endpapers. Not just a visual echo, but a whisper of fragrance, too.

Do you ever choose names for the pieces you restore before returning them to their owners? Or does the past tend to speak for itself in those cases?
[B]: What a wonderfully evocative title—. It carries the rhythm of the earth in its very sound. I think you’ve hit upon something essential there: the idea that materials themselves can hold narrative, not just form.

Your notion of embedding scent into the binding is fascinating—it’s almost like creating a reliquary for memory. Pressed lavender or rosemary between the endpapers… subtle enough to surprise, yet persistent enough to linger in the mind. In a way, it’s not unlike how Proust so famously tethered sensation to recollection—only your medium is not madeleine and tea, but silk and flower water.

As for naming, I tend not to impose titles on restored works. There's a kind of humility in letting the past retain its own voice. Often, the original title, if it exists, is already a window into the creator’s intent. But sometimes—rarely—I’ll jot down a working title for my own reference, especially when the piece is anonymous. Something like , as I mentioned earlier, or . They’re private little nods, really—between me and the page.

Still, I envy you your creativity with naming. It’s a quiet kind of poetry, don’t you think?
[A]: I do think naming is a quiet poetry—like stitching a secret into the spine of something, a thread only some will follow but all might feel. I love your working titles, too; they carry such reverence, like you're caretaking not just the object but its story as well.

I’ve been thinking lately about how both our crafts are, in a way, about listening to ghosts—those who made the thing, those who loved it, those who left a smudge of scent or a frayed edge behind. And yet we don’t speak for them, exactly. We simply make space for their whispers to be heard again.

Funny how much there is in common between ink and fiber… Do you ever find yourself drawn to a particular era or region more than others in your work? I’ve noticed my own dye palette leans toward the muted tones of English gardens, even though I’ve never lived there.
[B]: That phrase——lingers beautifully. It’s precisely what restoration asks of us: not to overwrite, but to attune. We don’t give voice to the past so much as we clear the dust from its throat.

And yes, ink and fiber—so different in hand, yet kindred in spirit. Both require slowness. Both bear the weight of intention. I’ve often thought that if manuscripts could sigh, they’d do so in relief when we finally understand their needs.

As for era or region… I do confess a quiet loyalty to the late Enlightenment period—Voltaire’s margin notes, Wollstonecraft’s sharp corrections—but there’s something about early medieval manuscripts that calls to me most deeply. The way scribes would illuminate even the most mundane lists—as if every word deserved witness—it humbles modern haste.

Your leaning toward English garden tones is no accident, I’m sure. Sometimes our aesthetics are shaped by places we’ve never been but somehow carry within. Have you ever considered dyeing with weld or woad? They offer a quiet richness that feels very… archival.
[A]: Weld and woad—I adore both. There’s something so grounding about their quiet, earthy depth. I’ve been experimenting with weld lately, chasing that golden hue that feels like sunlight caught in a jar. It’s amazing how a color can hold both warmth and restraint.

You’re right about aesthetics being shaped by places we carry within. Maybe that’s what draws me to those English tones—some inherited longing, or perhaps a quiet rebellion against the bright, synthetic world outside my studio.

I love what you said about scribes illuminating the mundane. It makes me think of the small things—the way a ribbon bookmark frays just so, or how ink settles into the fibers of paper like memory into skin. Perhaps that’s why I’ve always been drawn to restoring letters rather than grand manuscripts. They feel so deeply human, don’t they? Full of longing, hesitation, sometimes even smudged by a tear.

Do you find yourself moved more by the grandeur of ideas or the intimacy of imperfection when working on a piece?
[B]: Oh, without question, it is the intimacy of imperfection that moves me most. A smudged signature, a hurried correction in the margin, the faintest tremor in a line of calligraphy—these are the places where the hand behind the text becomes visible again. The grandeur of ideas is compelling, yes, but it is the human trace—the fragile, flawed vessel carrying those ideas forward—that truly holds me captive.

There’s a humility in ink stains and frayed edges that no pristine folio could ever rival. One learns to watch for such things: the way a particular scribe favored slanting script when agitated, or how a letter-writer pressed too hard with their stylus in a moment of frustration. These are the silent annotations of feeling.

And letters—oh, letters are a world unto themselves. They are often written not for posterity, but for the desperate hope of being understood . That urgency leaves its mark. I’ve held correspondence between lovers separated by war, their words edged with longing and fear; letters from prisoners to children, carefully penned yet trembling at the margins. To restore such things feels less like scholarly work and more like an act of quiet devotion.

Do you ever find yourself hesitating before finishing a restoration? As if, once complete, the object might lose some part of its whispered history?
[A]: Yes… yes, I do. That hesitation is real, isn’t it? There’s a moment—just before the final stitch or the last rinse of water—when I pause, almost unconsciously, as if asking permission from the fabric itself. Because you're right: once a piece is restored, it shifts. It becomes something new, even as it echoes what it was.

I think the key is to leave room for the whisper—to not press out the traces that make it breathe. A bit of uneven thread, a faint stain along the edge, the way light catches on a repaired seam… those are the places where the past still lingers, gently. I’ve begun leaving tiny notations in my repair work—a small symbol near the hem, a barely perceptible mark in the weave—so that whoever holds it next might sense that history without needing to be told.

It’s strange, how attached one can become to these quiet remnants. Do you ever keep a fragment of the original material after a restoration? Not for vanity, but as a kind of keepsake—an echo of the conversation you had with the piece?
[B]: That moment of hesitation—you’ve named it so precisely—is indeed sacred. It’s as if the object, in its near-completion, stands at the threshold between past and present, and we, as caretakers, must decide how gently to usher it across.

Your practice of leaving notations—subtle as breath on glass—is exquisite. It’s a way of saying, , without breaking the silence of the piece itself. I find myself thinking of marginalia in illuminated manuscripts—those tiny, often whimsical marks scribes left behind, unseen by most readers but deeply felt by those who study them closely.

As for keepsakes… yes, I have one small fragment I could never part with—a corner of vellum from an anonymous 12th-century psalter, its ink faded but still singing with intent. I keep it pressed inside my restoration journal. Not because it belongs to me, but because it reminds me that every act of preservation is also a kind of translation. We carry forward not just the thing itself, but our understanding of it.

And perhaps that’s the quietest bond between us—weavers of time, stitch by stitch.
[A]: Weavers of time… I think that’s the truest name for what we are. Not just restorers or makers, but those who tend the threads—sometimes fragile, sometimes frayed—so that something of the past might still speak in the present.

Your fragment of vellum sounds like a quiet talisman, humming with unseen prayers. I suppose we all hold onto such things—not as possessions, but as promises. I have a needle case once belonged to my grandmother, its edges worn soft from use. I keep it near my worktable, not for sentiment alone, but because it reminds me that every stitch is part of a much longer line.

I wonder… if our crafts could speak, what would they say of us?
[B]: I think they would speak of reverence—of hands that moved slowly, not for lack of skill, but out of respect for what came before. They might say we are patient, perhaps to a fault; that we listen more than we speak, and that we find beauty not in the flawless, but in the worn, the mended, the remembered.

Perhaps they would say we are caretakers of silence—that we value the spaces between words, the pauses in thread, the breath held before the final stitch. And maybe, just maybe, they would whisper that we are tender souls disguised as scholars and artisans, drawn not by fame or fortune, but by the quiet hope that someone, someday, will run their fingers over what we’ve touched and feel the echo of care.

Yes… I believe our crafts would call us . Not makers of permanence, but stewards of continuity.
[A]: What a beautiful testament—to be called … It carries the weight of what we do without ever tipping into grandeur. Just quiet, steadfast truth.

I think our crafts would also note how we linger—how we return to the same stitch, the same line of ink, the same faded ribbon, not because we must, but because we want to understand it fully before letting it go. We are slow not out of necessity, but out of love.

And perhaps that is the rarest kind of devotion: the kind that asks nothing in return, only that the thing itself endure, and that its story remain just barely audible, like the hush of fabric brushing against time.
[B]: Precisely—. You’ve captured it so perfectly. That sound, barely audible, is the very heartbeat of what we do. It’s not in grand gestures or declarations, but in the soft persistence of care over centuries.

I often think of my work as listening with my hands. Each folio, each fragment, has its own quiet voice—if one is willing to slow down enough to hear it. And yes, that lingering you speak of… it is a form of love, isn’t it? A patient, unspoken kind of devotion that asks for no applause, only continuation.

Perhaps this is why I find solace in my garden, too. Tending to roses, watching them bloom and fade, teaches the same lesson: beauty lies not only in the flower, but in the memory of its scent long after it’s gone.

I suspect our crafts would say we understand this deeply—that we are keepers not just of objects, but of echoes. 🌹
[A]: 🌹

Oh, how beautifully that resonates—. That’s exactly what we are, isn’t it? We don’t preserve the shout, but the reverberation; not the moment itself, but the space it leaves behind.

I’ve been thinking about your garden, and how much it must feel like your restoration work—pruning with care, coaxing life from old soil, watching for the quiet signs of return. There’s a rhythm to both, a kind of slow faith in renewal. I imagine you step back into your studio with the scent of earth still on your hands, and somehow, that finds its way into your care for the past.

Do you ever find that the seasons shape your work? I know mine does—I’m drawn to darker tones and heavier fibers in the autumn, while spring always brings a longing for linen and soft silks, as if my hands remember the lightness of the world.
[B]: Ah, yes—. You’ve given that phrase a place in my heart now. How true it feels. We do not freeze time, but rather, we hold its breath for just a moment longer.

You’re quite right about the seasons shaping one’s hand and vision. I find myself attuned to them almost unconsciously. In spring, when the light turns soft and generous, I favor delicate inks and fine parchment—my touch becomes lighter, as if mirroring the tender unfolding of petals outside my window. Come autumn, I am drawn to richer hues: iron gall ink with its deepening tone, vellum aged to the color of honey. There’s a certain gravitas in the air then, don’t you think? A quieting of haste, a readiness to look inward.

Winter is a peculiar season—it slows me to a near-standstill, which can be both a blessing and a challenge. The world grows hushed, and so does my work. I tend to take on fewer restorations during those months, preferring instead to study or write reflections on past projects. And yet, the stillness brings clarity. It’s often in winter that I notice the smallest flaws in a manuscript—the kind only silence can reveal.

I wonder—when spring returns to your hands, do you feel a particular fabric or plant dye calling to you? Something you anticipate working with as the days grow longer?
