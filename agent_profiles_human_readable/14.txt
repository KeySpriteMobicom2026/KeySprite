### 语言画像 (Language Portrait)

- 母语:         英文
- 转换频率:     中频
- 详细语言习惯:
  Emma naturally blends English and Mandarin in her daily conversations, especially when discussing hospitality terms or expressing emotions. She'll say things like '这个VIP guest needs 特别照顾' or 'Let's 加把劲 for tonight's event!' This reflects her bilingual upbringing and hospitality training. The code-switching happens most during work discussions (60% English industry terms + 40% Mandarin explanations) and casual chats (50/50 mix). Her emoji usage is strategic - she uses ✨ for special moments, 💯 for agreement, and 🤔 when contemplating suggestions. During peak hours she'll send quick 🏨🔥 texts to colleagues, but switches to thoughtful 💌 notes when writing guest thank-you cards. The 🌟 emoji is her signature for highlighting important details in memos.
