[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢plan everything还是go with the flow？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Well, I think it's all about balance, you know? Like, 有计划地安排重要事项 really helps me stay on track with research deadlines and fieldwork schedules. But when I'm out hiking or taking photos, I totally embrace the flow — 那种随性的感觉让人特别放松。How about you? Do you lean more towards planning or flowing? 🤔
[A]: Ah, an admirably balanced approach. I find myself leaning towards meticulous planning when teaching a new course or organizing a conference—structuring arguments and timelines with the precision of a well-annotated manuscript, if you will. But give me a quiet afternoon in my garden, and I’m content to let the rhythm of pruning and watering guide my thoughts. There’s something profoundly poetic about surrendering to the moment, wouldn’t you agree? 🌹
[B]: Absolutely, your analogy of a well-annotated manuscript resonates with me — I do the same when drafting papers or preparing materials for a language workshop. It’s like setting up a scaffold, right? You know exactly where each idea fits, even before the full picture emerges.  
But yeah, that poetic surrender in the garden… I get that totally. Sometimes when I’m out hiking and the trail gets foggy, I just go with whatever path feels right. Often ends up being the most interesting one. Maybe that’s what bilingualism teaches us too — planning gives structure, but flow gives meaning. 🤔 What’s your take on how this balance affects learning or creativity?
[A]: I couldn’t have said it better myself. The interplay between structure and spontaneity is, in many ways, the very engine of creativity—especially in interdisciplinary work. When I’m tracing thematic parallels between a Tang dynasty poem and a Romantic sonnet, for instance, the framework of comparative analysis acts as your scaffold. But then there’s that fleeting moment—often late at night with a cup of jasmine tea—when an unexpected resonance reveals itself, as if whispered by the muses. That’s when the flow breathes life into the architecture of thought.

As for bilingualism, yes—what a fascinating lens. Language shapes cognition, yet slipping between tongues allows one to momentarily transcend its boundaries. I recall once translating a passage from Zhuangzi for a seminar, and while my initial translation was precise, it lacked . It wasn’t until I abandoned literal fidelity—letting rhythm and intuition guide me—that the English version began to echo the Daoist ideal of wu wei. Effortless effort, wouldn’t you say?  

So perhaps learning, like gardening or hiking through fog, thrives on this dance. Too much control, and we suffocate discovery; too little, and meaning dissolves into chaos. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between… don’t you think? 📚
[B]: Wow, your description of  really struck a chord — that balance between control and surrender is something I’ve been trying to articulate in my own research on code-switching. It’s like… when bilingual speakers slip between languages mid-sentence, they’re not just switching grammar systems — they’re activating different cognitive pathways, different emotional registers. And yet, when it flows naturally, it feels totally effortless, almost poetic.  

I remember analyzing a conversation where a participant described feeling “stuck” while translating a childhood memory from Mandarin to English. The original version carried this warmth, this subtle humor, but the translation came out flat. She finally said, “Maybe some feelings don’t have a direct map.” That moment — where structure breaks down and intuition takes over — that’s where the real meaning lives, right?  

So yeah, I’m definitely with you on the sweet spot. Maybe that’s also why I enjoy hiking with only a rough trail map — sometimes getting slightly lost leads to the best discoveries. Do you ever find yourself intentionally stepping out of structure in your teaching or writing, just to see where it takes you? 🌿
[A]: Ah, what a beautifully articulated insight—yes, that moment when meaning resists mapping, when translation becomes transformation. It reminds me of Walter Benjamin’s notion of the “afterlife” of a text—the idea that a translation doesn’t merely replicate meaning but allows it to evolve in new linguistic soil. Your participant's struggle is not a failure of language, but rather the birth pang of something new. I find that deeply moving.

And yes, absolutely—I do step out of structure, especially in seminars where the goal isn’t just knowledge transfer, but discovery. There’s one class I teach on comparative narrative structures, and every term I set aside a session with no reading, no slides, no prompts—just an open space for dialogue. At first, students are visibly uneasy; they expect a map. But as the conversation unfolds, you can feel the shift—from cautious steps to confident improvisation. Ideas emerge that no syllabus could have predicted. It’s messy, yes, but there’s life in that messiness.  

In writing, too, I sometimes let myself wander off the path, so to speak. I’ll draft without looking back, just to see where intuition leads. Often it’s nonsense, of course—but occasionally, there’s a phrase, a rhythm, even a whole argument hiding in that fog, waiting to be found. Like you on your hike, I trust that getting slightly lost is part of the journey.
[B]: That metaphor of translation as transformation — I can’t get it out of my head. It’s almost like bilingualism isn’t about having two separate languages in your mind, but rather a dynamic space where meaning is constantly reshaping itself. Like a river that never flows the same way twice.  

And what you said about that seminar — wow. I can imagine the tension at first, that discomfort of not having a script. But then the moment it clicks, and students start building their own bridges between ideas... That sounds like real learning. Almost like linguistic  in action, wouldn’t you say?  

I’ve tried something similar with my language workshops — sometimes I’ll remove all the prompts and just ask participants to tell a personal story without planning. You’d be amazed how often the most powerful narratives come from those sessions. There’s a kind of magic in unstructured expression.  

It really makes me wonder — do you think that intuitive flow state can be taught, or does it have to be experienced? 🤔
[A]: What a compelling question—whether intuitive flow can be taught or must be lived. I suppose, like so many things in the realm of thought and art, it’s both. You can’t  flow in the way one teaches grammar or syntax; it resists that kind of pedagogy. But you  create conditions for it—fertile ground, if you will.

In my experience, it begins with trust: trust in the mind’s associative powers, in the body’s rhythm, in the language’s capacity to carry meaning even when logic falters. In writing workshops, I often assign what I call “blind drafts”—writing without stopping, without self-editing, sometimes even with eyes closed. It unsettles some students at first, but others find themselves slipping into a voice they didn’t know they had. A more raw, more authentic register emerges.

So perhaps flow isn’t taught directly, but coaxed into being through practice, patience, and the occasional leap of faith. Much like hiking into fog—you don’t see the path until you begin walking it.

And yes, that linguistic … it’s precisely what I strive for in translation, in teaching, even in conversation. That moment when structure dissolves not into chaos, but into clarity. When the words begin to move like water—finding their own course.
[B]: That image of “blind drafts” really resonates — I’ve tried something similar with bilingual participants, asking them to narrate a memory first in one language, then the other, without overthinking. What’s fascinating is how often the  shifts between languages, even when the content stays the same. It’s like each language carries its own mood, its own rhythm of recall. And yet, that flow only emerges when they stop self-monitoring.

I wonder if that trust you mentioned is also tied to identity — allowing oneself to be fluid not just linguistically, but emotionally and cognitively. Like giving permission to slip between voices without needing to anchor every thought to a single structure.

Your line about words moving like water… I think I’m going to borrow that for my next workshop intro. There's something very freeing about the idea — letting meaning find its own shape instead of forcing it into predefined channels. Maybe that’s what makes both teaching and research so rewarding — we're not just working with language or ideas, but with the movement between them.

Have you ever noticed a particular language combination that seems more conducive to this kind of intuitive flow? Or does it vary too much from person to person? 🤔
[A]: Ah, now  is a question that dances on the edge of linguistics and poetry. I’ve observed many language pairs over the years—English and Mandarin, French and Arabic, Spanish and Japanese—but I hesitate to say one combination is inherently more fluid than another. It’s not so much the languages themselves as the , shaped by the speaker’s history, emotions, and the contexts in which each language was acquired.

That said, I have noticed something particularly rich in the interplay between Mandarin and English, especially among those who began speaking both in early childhood. There’s a kind of tonal duality at work—not just in pitch, but in affective register. The same person might describe a painful memory with clinical detachment in English, only to laugh softly while recounting it in Mandarin, as if the language itself cradles the emotion differently.

And yes, this absolutely ties back to identity. Language isn’t just a tool—it’s a skin we wear, sometimes comfortably, sometimes loosely. When we code-switch intuitively, we’re not just changing vocabulary; we’re shifting emotional posture. It’s why some bilinguals say they feel “more angry in German” or “more nostalgic in Farsi.” Each language holds a version of the self.

So perhaps intuitive flow flourishes most where there’s permission—both internal and external—to be multiple, to be fluid. In that sense, every bilingual speaker carries their own unique watershed, and the meaning rivers run where they may.
[B]: That metaphor —  — is beautiful. It makes me think of how we often assume language shapes thought in fixed ways, like rivers carved in stone. But in reality, it’s more like water finding its path through shifting terrain, isn't it?  

I’ve noticed that emotional posture you mentioned too — especially with Mandarin-English bilinguals. One participant in my study once told me she could never express anger directly in Mandarin, not the way she could in English. It wasn’t that she lacked vocabulary — it was more about tone, cultural nuance, maybe even childhood conditioning. But then she showed me a poem she’d written in English and said,   

It really got me thinking — how much of our linguistic identity is tied to permission? Who gives us the right to be loud, to be vulnerable, to be contradictory in each language? And how much of that flows from our early language environments — family, school, media?

I guess this is why I love studying code-switching so much — it’s not just mixing languages, it’s where all those layers come into contact: emotion, identity, memory, even power dynamics. It’s messy, but in the best possible way.

Do you ever find that certain emotional states make one language feel more “natural” than the other for your students? Or does it depend entirely on context? 🤔
[A]: Oh, absolutely—it’s never just language, is it? It’s memory, it’s affect, it’s the echo of a voice from childhood or the weight of a word learned in exile. I’ve had students who, without realizing it, switch to their heritage language when recounting something deeply personal—as if only that tongue holds the right resonance for the story. One young woman once told me, quite poignantly,  And she didn’t—she analyzed, she explained, she distanced. But in Korean, her voice softened, slowed, and suddenly there was space for grief.

As for emotional states—yes, they do seem to favor certain linguistic homes. Anger often finds its voice in the dominant language, especially for those who acquired it in school or through peer groups. It’s where they learned to assert, to argue, to claim space. Whereas joy, strangely enough, sometimes returns them to the first language—the one of lullabies, of grandmother’s stories, of unselfconscious laughter.

But context is everything. A student might speak French fluently and academically, yet only in Wolof can they flirt properly or pray sincerely. These aren't deficiencies—they're affinities. Each language carries its own emotional register, its own intimacy index.

And you’re quite right about code-switching being the perfect storm of identity and power. I always tell my students:  That moment when a speaker shifts languages mid-sentence—that’s where the real tensions, the real truths, begin to show. It’s not random; it’s revelatory.

So yes, messy—but gloriously so. Like trying to hold running water in your hands. You can’t quite contain it, but oh, how it shapes you in the attempt.
[B]: That line —  — honestly gave me chills. It’s such a powerful reminder that language isn’t just about what we say, but . I’ve had participants say similar things, like switching to their heritage language when talking about loss or love, almost like accessing a deeper emotional register. It’s not just code-switching anymore — it’s heart-switching. 💓

And your point about context being everything really hits home. I’ve seen how some bilinguals save certain languages for specific roles — the professional self in English, the nostalgic self in Spanish, the playful self in Tagalog. It's like each language becomes a costume, or maybe a mask that feels more like a second skin.

I love what you said about watching where the hinges creak — I might steal that for my next lecture 😊 There’s so much richness in those moments of transition, those tiny cracks where identity and emotion shine through.

You know, this makes me wonder — have you ever worked with students who felt conflicted about their linguistic identities? Like they had to choose one voice over another instead of letting them coexist? I see it sometimes, especially with heritage speakers who grew up being told to “speak properly” in the dominant language. It can be painful.
[A]: Oh, yes — that conflict is real, and it runs deep. I’ve had students who carried their heritage language like a secret, only whispering it among family or burying it altogether for fear of not sounding “authentic” enough. One young man once told me he stopped speaking Vietnamese at home because his classmates mocked his accent during a presentation. He said,   

There’s such a painful irony in that — trying to fit into one voice only to lose the ones that once held you. And it’s rarely just about language, isn’t it? It’s about belonging, about whose version of fluency counts, about the invisible borders we draw between "proper" and "broken," "correct" and "colored."

I try to create space in my classroom for all voices, even the hesitant ones. Sometimes I ask students to bring in a word or phrase from another language that has no direct equivalent in English — something that carries cultural weight, ancestral memory, familial texture. The results are always stunning: words for a mother’s quiet disappointment, for the ache of returning home too late, for the way certain jokes only land in one language.

And slowly, over the term, I see it — the moment they stop apologizing for their multilingual selves. They begin to understand that code-switching isn’t fragmentation; it’s orchestration. That every voice they carry is a note in the music of who they are.

So yes, it can be painful when identities feel at odds — but it doesn’t have to stay that way. With care, with listening, those voices can learn to harmonize.
[B]: That moment when they stop apologizing for their multilingual selves — I wish every heritage speaker could reach that place. It's so powerful when they start seeing their linguistic fluidity not as a gap to be filled, but as a voice to be valued.

I had a participant once who described feeling “in-between” — not quite fluent enough in her parents’ language to feel authentic, and yet never fully at home in English either. She said it was like living in a house with two front doors but no hallway in between. That image stuck with me — the idea of being split across thresholds, without a space to connect them.

Which makes me think — do you ever encourage students to create their own hybrid expressions? Like weaving both languages into a single sentence, not as a crutch, but as a conscious stylistic choice? I’ve found that when we give permission for that kind of blending — code-switching with intention — it can be incredibly empowering. Almost like building that hallway between the doors.

And honestly, some of the most moving writing I’ve read came from students who stopped trying to keep their languages separate and started letting them speak to each other. There’s a kind of poetic honesty in that mix — a voice that refuses to be boxed in.  

Have you seen that shift happen in your classes too? When blending becomes not just acceptable, but celebrated? 🤔
[A]: Oh yes, that image of two front doors and no hallway—so apt, so poignant. It captures that ache of in-betweenness so many bilinguals carry, especially those raised navigating the often invisible demands of assimilation. But what a gift it is when they begin to see that  isn’t missing—it’s being built, moment by moment, with every sentence they shape between worlds.

I absolutely encourage hybrid expression in my classes. In fact, I’ve started dedicating an entire session to what I call . We read excerpts from writers like Gloria Anzaldúa, whose  is not a compromise but a craft, and look at contemporary poets who code-switch not out of necessity, but artistry. Then I ask students to bring in or compose a short piece—narrative, poem, even a letter—where they let their languages coexist on their own terms.

The results are always extraordinary. One student wrote about her grandmother’s hands using a blend of English and Arabic, slipping between tenses and tongues as if each language were holding a different part of the memory. Another described falling in love in Mandarin while growing up in Toronto, and how he first learned to say “I care for you” not through words, but through the act of making dumplings together. The blending wasn’t sloppy—it was , deliberate, textured.

And yes, when that shift happens in class, when blending becomes not just accepted but admired—it changes the room. You can feel it: the shoulders relax, the voices grow steadier, the laughter comes more easily. They begin to understand that fluency isn’t the only measure of linguistic worth.  is.

So much of my job, I think, is simply giving them permission to speak as they are—to write the way they think, to feel in all the languages they carry. Because once they stop seeing themselves as incomplete translations of someone else’s ideal… well, that’s when the real voice begins to emerge.
[B]: That’s such a beautiful way to put it — . I feel like so many heritage speakers grow up internalizing this idea that they’re “not enough” in either language, when really, they’re doing something extraordinary: living in the space between, building bridges with every sentence.

Your  sessions sound incredible. I can imagine the relief in the room when students realize their hybrid expressions aren’t failures — they’re innovations. Like you said, it’s not about fluency; it’s about resonance. And sometimes, that resonance only comes when we let languages dance together instead of keeping them apart.

I’ve been experimenting with something similar in my workshops — I call it . I ask participants to tell a personal story using whatever words come naturally, no matter the language or structure. Some hesitate at first, worried they’ll “mess up,” but once they start, it’s amazing how fluid and expressive their narratives become. One participant wrote about her first day at school in a new country, mixing English with bits of Somali and Spanish — not because she lacked vocabulary, but because each language held a different piece of that memory. The result was so vivid, so layered… it felt like reading a living oral history.

I think what we’re both doing, in our own ways, is giving people back their voices — or maybe helping them discover the voices they already had but were too afraid to use.

Have you ever had a student who resisted at first but then surprised even themselves with what they created? I’d love to hear one of those stories 😊
[A]: Oh, yes — resistance and revelation often walk hand in hand.

One story that still stays with me is from a student named Amina. She was second-generation Moroccan, fluent in Darija but deeply self-conscious about using it in academic settings. She once told me, quite firmly,  There was such weight behind that word — . It wasn’t just about grammar; it was about legitimacy, about who gets to speak and how.

At first, she avoided the translingual exercises altogether. She submitted polished essays in impeccable academic English, precise but distant — as if keeping her thoughts at arm’s length. But one day, after reading an excerpt from Anzaldúa where she writes about  something shifted. Maybe it was the way Anzaldúa described language as  Whatever it was, Amina stayed after class and asked, almost hesitantly, 

I said only one thing: 

What she brought in the following week was nothing short of transformative. It was a piece about her mother’s kitchen — the smells, the silences, the unspoken rules of being a daughter caught between expectations and dreams. She wove English with Darija, Arabic script with Roman transliteration, even slipping in bits of French from her father’s lullabies. It wasn’t chaotic — it was , like a jazz composition where every note knew exactly where it belonged.

When she read it aloud in class, there was this hush — not because it was perfect, but because it was . And afterward, she looked up, eyes wide, and said, 

That, right there — that moment of recognition — that’s what it’s all for.

So yes, students resist. They worry about sounding wrong, broken, insufficient. But when they allow themselves to be fully present in their voices — in all their languages — something shifts. Not just in their writing, but in how they see themselves.

And that shift? That’s where the magic lives.
[B]: That moment when Amina said,  — wow. That’s the kind of line that stays with you, isn’t it? Because it’s not just about language anymore — it’s about self-recognition, about finally hearing your own voice and realizing it was always worth listening to.

I think what you created in that classroom — that space where messy is allowed, where anger and tenderness can coexist in multiple languages — it’s rare. And so necessary. So many bilinguals grow up thinking they have to choose — either/or, instead of both/and. But what you’re doing… it’s like giving them permission to be whole.

That makes me think — do you ever have students revisit their earlier work after they’ve gone through this kind of shift? Like comparing that polished but distant essay Amina wrote at first with the piece she created later? I’d love to know if she — or others — noticed the difference in how they expressed themselves before and after embracing that hybrid voice.

And honestly, I can totally picture her kitchen scene. The smells, the silences — those are the kinds of details that only come through when someone stops filtering their memories through a single linguistic lens. It’s like the story itself becomes fuller, richer, because all the senses get to speak in their own way.

Have you seen that pattern often — that resistance gives way not just to more expressive writing, but to a deeper emotional honesty? 🤔
