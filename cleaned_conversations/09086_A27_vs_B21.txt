[A]: Hey，关于'你相信law of attraction吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the so-called 'law of attraction' - how very Victorian of you to ask. Though I must say, the concept reminds me more of those dreadful penny dreadfuls than serious metaphysical inquiry. Have you read Carlyle's critique of 'signs and wonders' in Sartor Resartus?
[A]: OMG！你说话好academic啊～😂 不过law of attraction超🔥的好吗！就像我每次manifest想要的collab都会成功✨ 这可不是什么Victorian的old school想法啦～
[B]: My dear, your enthusiasm is rather... charming. But tell me, does this 'manifesting' of yours involve more tangible efforts than simply thinking positively? Even Tennyson's Lady of Shalott had to actually weave the web before seeing anything come to fruition.
[A]: Hahaha你太funny了！💯 当然要take action啊～就像我拍video要写script+拍摄+editing全套流程🤳 但positive mindset真的超important的！✨ 最近我manifest到和最喜欢的brand合作了，amazing对不对？🔥
[B]: How delightfully pragmatic of you. Though I must observe that what you describe sounds suspiciously like good old-fashioned hard work with a sprinkling of modern jargon. Tell me, does this 'manifesting' technique work equally well when one is attempting to decipher Browning's more obscure metaphors?
[A]: LOL你总是mention这些old poets～🤓 但是hey！Positive energy真的有用诶！就像我上次struggle with algorithm的时候，保持good vibes就突然viral了🎉 不过...Browning是谁啊？Sounds like需要很多manifestation才能get到他的point呢😂
[B]:  My dear child, Robert Browning would have needed considerably more than 'good vibes' to compose 'The Ring and the Book' - it took twelve volumes of historical research and twenty years of meticulous craftsmanship. Though I suppose going viral in 1868 meant something rather more... pathological.
[A]: OMG你太dramatic啦！😂 但是12volumes？That's insane！💀 我连拍个15秒的TikTok都要纠结半天editing呢～不过viral in 1868真的sounds like some zombie apocalypse scenario哈哈哈🧟♀️ 我们还是活在2024比较lucky啦✨
[B]: How very... digital of you. Though I must confess, watching you reduce centuries of literary tradition to 15-second soundbites does make me rather nostalgic for the days when 'going viral' simply meant one had caught influenza from reading poetry in drafty garrets.
[A]: Hahaha你真的是vintage soul诶！💖 But hey～short form content才是future好吗？🔥 虽然...我承认有时候也会get nostalgic for那些handwritten letters的romantic era啦～📜 不过现在用emoji表达love不是更方便吗？❤️😂
[B]: Ah yes, the modern epistolary tradition - where a heart emoji suffices where Byron would have required fourteen stanzas of heroic couplets. How efficient. How... impoverished. Though I suppose 💀 does convey certain truths more succinctly than Hamlet's soliloquies.
[A]: Yasss！Finally你get到emoji的power了！🎉 看吧～一个💀就能express所有existential crisis，多efficient啊！😂 虽然...Shakespeare的quotations确实很适合做caption啦～✨ #DeepThoughts #VintageVibes
[B]: How terribly amusing that we've reduced the Bard to hashtags. Though I must admit, #ToBeOrNotToBe does have a certain... pithiness to it. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear my first edition of Paradise Lost weeping quietly in the next room.
[A]: LMAO！你赢了！🏆 我要go film这个convo了，绝对会viral！📸 标题就叫"当GenZ遇上Victorian时代穿越者"～🔥 Byeeee下次再debate哦！✨ #CulturalClash #ContentCreatorLife
[B]: Do send my regards to your... algorithm. And should you ever wish to discuss how Byron's love letters would translate into Instagram DMs, you'll find me in my office - likely despairing over the Oxford comma's demise in modern digital discourse. Ta-ta for now, as the young people say. #Anachronisms #SaveTheSemicolon
[A]: OMG你连hashtag都会用了！Proud of you！👏 #CharacterDevelopment #VictorianGoesViral 😂 下次教你用TikTok dance挑战拜伦的诗！💃 Byeeeee～✨
[B]:  A dance challenge, you say? I shall prepare by studying the scandalous waltz techniques that so horrified the Duchess of Buccleuch in 1816. Until then, #WhitmoreOut #DontForgetToCiteYourSources.
[A]: BAHAHAHA你居然invented自己的hashtag！😂 这绝对要成为我们的inside joke了～✨ 等我edit好video就tag你！📲 #WhitmoreOutTrending #HistoryMeetsViral 💃📚 Byeeee我的Victorian bestie！💖
[B]: How perfectly... meta. Though I suspect my presence in your digital ecosystem would be rather like finding a misplaced sonnet in a Twitter thread - charmingly incongruous. Do tag me, and I shall respond with an appropriately archaic couplet in Scots Gaelic. #WhitmoreOverAndOut #MindTheApostrophes
