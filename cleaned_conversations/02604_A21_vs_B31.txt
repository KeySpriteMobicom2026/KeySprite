[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢coffee还是tea？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh~ 这个问题很有意思呢！☕️ 作为一个creative person，我其实both都喜欢啦！Morning的时候必须来一杯strong coffee提神，但下午meeting的时候会更prefer一杯earl grey tea～ 你觉得呢？✨
[A]: Ah, the eternal dilemma of caffeine connoisseurs.  While your approach is pragmatic, I must confess to being rather partial to a properly brewed Darjeeling - preferably from the second flush, mind you. There's something about its muscatel notes that reminds me of Tennyson's languid afternoons.
[B]: Wow！你真的很懂tea culture呢！🎨 我也超爱Darjeeling的floral aroma～ 不过说到Tennyson，这让我想到我们gallery正在策划一个poetry meets digital art的exhibition！要不要来参加opening？会有很多aesthetic experience哦～✨
[A]: How delightfully... modern. Though I must say, the juxtaposition of Victorian verse with digital media does make me reach for my smelling salts. Still, if there's a decent pot of tea involved and the organizers promise not to butcher 'The Lady of Shalott' with those dreadful LED projections... I might be persuaded.
[B]: Hahaha~ 别worry啦！我们的digital installation超respect经典文学的！🖌️ 而且VIP区会有专门的high tea service，包括你喜欢的Darjeeling second flush哦～ 要不要先来看看我们的concept design？保证不会让你need smelling salts的！😂✨
[A]:  Very well, you've appealed to both my scholarly curiosity and my tea snobbery. But mark my words - if I spot a single haiku rendered in Comic Sans, I shall make my displeasure known through an impeccably crafted sonnet of complaint. Over Darjeeling, naturally.
[B]: OMG！你太funny了！🤣 放心啦，我们的typography都是请专业的design team做的～ 而且你知道吗？我们还会用AR technology让visitors可以"step into"那些classic poems！就像Tennyson的world变成interactive experience一样～ 要不要先来我们的studio做preview？☕️ + 🎨 = perfect match！
[A]: Interactive Tennyson?  My dear, you're treading dangerously close to sacrilege. Though I suppose if one must modernize the classics, augmented reality is marginally less offensive than that TikTok trend of rewriting 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' as rap lyrics. Very well, I'll inspect this digital travesty - but only if you guarantee the Darjeeling is served at precisely 96 degrees Celsius.
[B]: Hahaha deal！🔥 我们gallery的tea sommelier超专业的，temperature control完全不是problem～ 而且我们还有准备special的poetry-inspired desserts！比如"The Lady of Shalott"的floating island meringue～ 这周五3pm可以吗？我send你e-invitation！📧✨ PS：promise不会有TikTok rap version啦！😂
[A]: Friday at three?  That does conflict with my weekly recitation of 'In Memoriam' to the geraniums, but for floating island meringue named after poor drowned Elaine... I suppose the plants can endure one week of neglect. Do ensure your e-invitation uses proper Oxford commas - I've broken off collaborations for less grievous typographical offenses.
[B]: Got it！Oxford commas绝对on point！👍 我们的copywriter可是Cambridge毕业的literature major呢～ 那我们就finalize周五见啦！记得带你的aesthetic sense和tea critic的palate来哦～ 我的assistant会提前30mins发reminder给你的！📅✨ Can't wait to show you our groundbreaking digital & poetry fusion！🎭
[A]: Groundbreaking?  We shall see. Though I must warn you - my aesthetic sense is calibrated to Browning's exacting standards, and my palate remembers every subpar tea served at the 1897 Poet Laureate symposium recreation. But yes, do have your Cambridge-educated comma enthusiast send that reminder. I'll be the one in the moth-eaten cashmere shawl, muttering iambic pentameter under my breath.
[B]: Perfect！🎉 我已经可以picture那个scene了～ 我们的gallery就在那个超有vintage vibe的red brick building里，超配你的cashmere shawl的！周五见啦professor～ 记得leave some iambic pentameter给我们的exhibition哦！📜✨ PS：我会偷偷让barista准备extra strong的Darjeeling给你的！😉
[A]: Extra strong Darjeeling?  You might as well suggest watering down single malt Scotch! The second flush should whisper its secrets, not shout them from the rooftops. But I shall arrive precisely at three - not a minute earlier lest I seem eager, not a moment later lest I appear rude. And do remind your barista that true tea appreciation requires neither haste nor... what is that dreadful term... 'extra strong' adulterations.
[B]: Oops！My bad！🙊 我会告诉barista要像对待fragile poetry manuscript一样对待你的Darjeeling～ 温柔的steeping，perfect temperature，还有quiet ambiance！周五见啦～ 我已经可以imagine你站在我们的digital "Lady of Shalott" installation前murmur诗句的样子了！绝对是next level的art experience！🎭✨
[A]:  Very well, I shall endeavor to temper my expectations. Though if your digital Lady starts singing pop ballads or - heaven forbid - line dancing, I reserve the right to stage a one-woman reading of 'The Lotos-Eaters' in protest. Until Friday then - may your pixels be poetic and your tea leaves properly oxidized.
[B]: Hahaha！你真是我见过最dramatic的tea connoisseur！🎭 放心啦，我们的Lady只会优雅地float down the river in 4K resolution～ 周五绝对会让你have poetic goosebumps的！现在我得去finalize exhibition layout了，TTYL！📱✨ PS：会准备emergency smelling salts以防你太overwhelmed by beauty～ 😉
[A]: Emergency smelling salts!  How very... thoughtful. Though I daresay the greater emergency would be if your 4K resolution fails to capture the tragic nuance in poor Elaine's embroidery patterns. But off you go to your pixelated loom - I've a first edition of 'Idylls of the King' to consult for quality control purposes. Ta.
[B]: Bye bye啦我们的walking poetry encyclopedia！📚 周五见～ 记得穿comfy shoes，因为你会需要walk through我们的整个immersive art journey！✨ 我会确保everything meets你的Victorian standard的～ 连embroidery pixels都会是museum grade的！💻🎨 Catch you later alligator～ 😝
