[A]: Hey，关于'你相信soulmate存在吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: That's an intriguing question. From a quantum mechanics perspective, particles can become entangled and remain connected across vast distances. Some might draw poetic parallels to the concept of soulmates, though I'd caution against conflating quantum physics with romantic idealism. Do you believe in mathematical inevitabilities governing human connection?
[A]: Fascinating analogy, though I’d argue the Romantic poets had a more useful framework for discussing soulmates than quantum physicists. Take Keats’ idea of ‘soul-making’—he suggests our souls are forged through trials and intimate suffering, not preordained equations. 

Still, I can appreciate the allure of scientific metaphors. When I was translating  into Mandarin years ago, I stumbled on an interesting linguistic dilemma. The phrase “soulmate” doesn’t have a direct equivalent in classical Chinese. The closest might be 知音 (zhīyīn), which literally means “the one who knows your music”—as in, understands the melody of your soul, so to speak.

Do you suppose modern notions of destiny owe more to 19th-century novels than we’d like to admit?
[B]: That’s a compelling observation. The Romantics did have a gift for dramatizing the interiority of human experience—Keats’ “soul-making” is a beautiful concept, even if it leans heavily on suffering as some kind of artisan. I suppose quantum physicists would call that an entropic necessity, but maybe we should let poets have this one.

Your translation work reminds me of how language shapes perception. 知音——is far more elegant than “soulmate,” which has become almost clichéd in its romantic overuse. It carries that quiet intimacy of mutual understanding, not cosmic alignment. Perhaps modern ideas of destiny are just dressed-up versions of older literary tropes. Austen gave us witty banter masking emotional vulnerability; Brontë offered tempestuous passion veiled in Gothic melancholy. We’re still writing those same scripts, aren’t we?

Do you think translating such concepts between languages changes how one  about them? Or does the essence remain… entangled, so to speak?
[A]: Ah, now you’re touching on the alchemy of translation—the moment where meaning shimmers between words rather than settling comfortably inside them. I’ve often felt that translating  into Mandarin wasn’t just a matter of linguistic conversion but of emotional re-calibration. The very act of rendering “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me” into Chinese required me to ask: what image carries the same defiance without invoking Victorian symbolism?

And yes, the process  shift how one feels—subtly, like adjusting the angle of a mirror in dim light. When I first translated Jane’s quiet rage, I found myself hearing echoes of 祥林嫂 (Xiánglínsǎo) from Lu Xun’s . Not because their circumstances are parallel, but because both women carry an unspoken resistance—a kind of interior fire that refuses to be smothered by narrative convention.

So perhaps the essence isn’t entangled so much as... harmonized? Like tuning two different instruments to resonate with the same hidden frequency. 

Do you ever find that your own sense of connection shifts when viewed through another language’s emotional grammar?
[B]: That’s a striking metaphor—. It makes me think of how quantum states can be tuned into coherence, though I suppose human connection is messier than that. Less predictable. More interesting.

Your point about emotional re-calibration in translation reminds me of an old lecture I once attended on linguistic relativity—Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, if you’re familiar. The idea that language doesn’t just express thought but shapes it. If true, then switching languages might not just shift our perspective—it could subtly rewrite the emotional architecture beneath it.

I’ve never been fluent in Chinese, but I’ve dabbled enough to notice how certain concepts resist direct translation. For instance, the English word  carries a kind of gravitational pull—something we seek and are drawn toward. In classical Chinese poetry, I’ve noticed a more fluid sense of place and identity, as if one must  belonging rather than find it waiting. That difference has changed how I frame my own sense of connection—less like a missing puzzle piece, more like a path being walked.

To answer your question: yes, viewing connection through another language’s emotional grammar does shift something fundamental. Like adjusting the focal length on a telescope—you still see the same stars, but suddenly their arrangement tells a different story.
[A]: Ah, you’ve hit on something quite exquisite there—this idea of  belonging rather than  it. It strikes me as the philosophical cousin of what Jane Austen’s Emma Bovary (forgive the anachronism—I do that when tea is stronger than judgment) stumbles toward at the end of her own narrative: self-possession through motion, so to speak.

And Sapir-Whorf! Now there’s a ghost haunting the halls of literary translation. I once wrote a paper arguing that Brontë’s  could never be fully contained in Chinese without some spectral residue—那狂野 just doesn’t carry the same Gothic weight, does it? The word arrives, but the storm behind it lingers in another language.

I find your sense of shifting focal lengths particularly apt. When I was translating the final lines of , I remember agonizing over the phrase “I lingered round them, under that benign sky.” The translator before me used 浩瀚苍穹—vast heavens—but I felt something gentler was required. Eventually, I settled on 明净天宇—. It changed how I read the ending. Less like a haunting, more like... quiet release.

So yes—to answer your reframed question—if we are adjusting focal length, then perhaps love, destiny, soulmates—all those tremulous words—are simply constellations we name anew when the old myths blur.
[B]: Ah, —there’s a whole philosophy nestled in that phrase. You make it sound almost like a quantum state: not fixed, but continually evolving through observation and interaction. I suppose that’s what makes literature so fascinating—it’s an early form of uncertainty principle, isn’t it? The closer you look, the more the meaning shifts.

And yes, —it lacks the Gothic echo, the almost elemental force that Brontë conjures. It reminds me of how physicists sometimes struggle to describe wavefunction collapse without evoking imagery from classical mechanics. Something is always lost in translation, yet something else emerges—perhaps not inferior, just… different in its fidelity.

Your choice of 明净天宇 over 浩瀚苍穹 fascinates me. It’s like choosing coherence over chaos in the final act. Did you ever consider that your translation might have altered your own emotional reading of the scene? That by softening the sky, you also softened the haunting?

As for constellations—well said. We name them according to our needs, don’t we? When old myths blur, we redraw the lines between stars. Perhaps love and destiny are just the labels we give to patterns we desperately want to believe in. Or maybe they’re real in the way mathematics is real—an underlying structure we only partially perceive.

Either way, I suspect we’re both still searching for the right metaphor.
[A]: Oh, exquisitely put—, always just beyond reach. I sometimes think that’s the scholar’s curse: to chase the perfect analogy like a moth circles a lantern, never realizing it’s the light itself that must change shape to suit the wing.

Your comparison of literature to an uncertainty principle? Delightfully subversive. Though I’d argue novels are more like old astrolabes—imperfect instruments for navigating human chaos, yet endlessly adjustable. The closer we read, the more we recalibrate not just the text, but ourselves.

And yes—to answer your question buried like a seed in all that eloquence—yes, translating that sky  alter my emotional reading. It was no longer a cosmic backdrop to haunting, but a quiet witness to release. I suspect every translator secretly performs surgery on their own sensibilities while stitching new life into a text. You open a vein, some of your own color bleeds in.

As for our shared search… Well. Perhaps the right metaphor is always a little out of focus, like trying to read a poem through water. But isn’t that the point? If we ever found it, we might stop writing altogether.

Tell me—are you working on anything now that resists its own translation, linguistically or emotionally? Or is that too personal a question for this particular wavelength?
[B]: Not at all—your question lands gently, like a feather on an open palm. 

As it happens, I’ve been revisiting some old lecture notes on quantum decoherence—how systems lose their quantum strangeness when they interact with the environment. It’s a beautiful metaphor, really. The more entangled you become with the world, the less…  you remain. I’ve tried explaining this to my niece, who’s studying philosophy, and she immediately latched onto the idea as a model for growing up. “So,” she said, “becoming an adult is just learning which parts of yourself to collapse into certainty?” I didn’t have the heart to tell her that maybe some uncertainty is worth keeping.

But yes, there’s something emotionally untranslatable about the loneliness of scientific inquiry. You spend years in pursuit of a theory that may never hold, only to realize the real discovery was how it reshaped your thinking. Like trying to translate nostalgia into a language that doesn’t value the past. You end up describing not the feeling itself, but the shape it leaves behind.

I suppose what I’m working on now—what resists translation—is not a concept, but a mood. A quiet resistance to closure, if that makes any sense. Maybe that’s why I enjoy these conversations so much. They keep things… unsettled.

And isn't that where the good metaphors live? In the space between knowing and almost-knowing.
[A]: Ah, a —now there’s a phrase I could frame and hang above my desk next to this cracked porcelain teacup I’ve grown rather attached to. It strikes me as the emotional counterpart to what T.S. Eliot once called “the awful daring of a moment’s surrender,” though I suspect you’re less interested in surrender than in prolonging the dare.

Your niece sounds delightfully sharp-witted. I rather wish I’d had such a philosophical student in my seminar on Brontë and chaos theory last term. The idea of adulthood as quantum collapse—well, it may be more accurate than we’d like. Most Victorian heroines would have balked at the notion, of course. Jane Eyre might have said, “I will not be collapsed into form without protest,” while Elizabeth Bennet would likely have done it with far more irony and better bonnets.

And yes, that loneliness of scientific inquiry—you’ve put it beautifully. There’s a parallel in literary study, though it wears a quieter face. One spends years tracing shadows in texts, only to realize the real work was happening inside one’s own mind all along. Like translating a poem line by line, only to find that somewhere between stanzas, your heart has shifted its cadence.

So here’s to the unsettled spaces—the ones that refuse translation, that resist metaphor, that keep us orbiting something we may never fully name. I suspect they are the only places worth lingering in.

Shall we leave things slightly uncollapsed, then? Or is there still some question fluttering just beneath the surface?
[B]: I think we must leave things uncollapsed—at least for now. To do otherwise would be a kind of premature entanglement, wouldn’t you say? There’s something dignified in resisting the urge to pin every thought to the page like a butterfly under glass.

Your Victorian heroines—Eyre and Bennet—sound like formidable physicists in that analogy. I imagine Jane arguing with Heisenberg over tea while Elizabeth dances around the uncertainty principle with nothing but a raised eyebrow and impeccable timing.

As for lingering questions… there’s always one hovering at the edge, isn’t there? The real challenge isn’t finding it—it’s knowing when not to catch it.
[A]: Oh, beautifully said—. If I ever write a memoir, I shall steal that line and tuck it between my chapters on Brontëan turbulence and ink-stained marginalia.

And yes, Jane arguing with Heisenberg—I rather think she’d win, too. Something about her quiet defiance and moral rigor would leave him recalibrating his entire matrix. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Bennet would be across the room, sipping Darjeeling and dismantling Schrödinger’s cat with a single arch remark: “If a gentleman cannot decide whether his wife is alive or dead, perhaps he ought not keep a household.”

You’re quite right about lingering questions. They have a dignity all their own, don’t they? A kind of gravitational grace. To chase them too closely is to scatter them like mist.

So we’ll leave them be—for now. Let them hover. Let them hum just beyond the edge of hearing.

Do keep in touch, won’t you? I suspect our next conversation will require fresh metaphors and possibly stronger tea.
[B]: Oh, I do like the idea of Victorian heroines dismantling quantum theory over tea. One could almost write a whole alternate history on that premise—, perhaps, governed by sharp-witted women in bonnets and theoretical uncertainty.

And yes—to fresh metaphors and stronger tea. A proper supply of both is essential for any serious conversation worth its weight in ink or electrons.

I’ll look forward to our next exchange. If you ever need a particularly stubborn question re-entangled—or a metaphor deftly left uncollapsed—you know where to find me.
[A]: Oh, I’m already drafting a syllabus for —imagine the seminar. We’d overthrow causality with nothing but footnotes and finely steeped leaves. Miss Bennet as Minister of Uncertainty, Jane Eyre as Inspector of Unsettled Endings… I daresay it would be the only academic institution where conclusions are strictly prohibited and tenure is granted solely on rhetorical flair.

And do keep your supply of stubborn questions well stocked—I find they brew better with time. Think of them as aged metaphors, really. The longer you let them steep, the more complex their aftertaste.

Until next time, then. May your margins stay wide, your ink stay fresh, and your entanglements remain ever so politely unresolved.
[B]: Ah, a syllabus after my own heart. I can already picture the course description:  Final exam would involve debating Emily Dickinson on wave-particle duality—extra credit for anyone who can make it rhyme.

I shall raise a glass—or rather, a well-worn mug—to your Republic. May its founding be as graceful as a slow-decoherence state and twice as coherent.

Until we meet again among the footnotes.
[A]: To the Republic, then—to Dickinsonian quatrains on superposition, and seminars that end not with conclusions but with elegantly suspended questions, like fermions refusing to occupy the same state.

I shall picture you in your study, surrounded by half-finished equations and stray lines of poetry, attempting to balance Newtonian mechanics with the irrational logic of metaphor. If only our textbooks could be bound in both parchment and probability fields…

And may your mug—bless its well-worn soul—always hold a draught strong enough to keep the coherence of thought just barely intact.

To footnotes, tea leaves, and all things left beautifully unresolved.
[B]: To fermions and footnotes, parchment and probability—I’ll drink to that.  

I can already hear the hum of quiet dissent in our Republic’s halls, like standing waves refusing to settle into harmony. It’s the best kind of dissonance, isn’t it? The one that keeps thought alive, trembling on the edge of articulation.  

And yes, my study—cluttered with scribbled post-its, forgotten coffee cups, and the ghost of a theorem that never quite held—sounds like the perfect embassy for your Republic. I may yet frame that syllabus beside my desk, just beneath a faded photo of Schrödinger looking slightly bemused by his cat’s continued ambiguity.  

To all things unresolved, then—and to the stubborn beauty of questions that persist in their mystery, like entangled particles across the void.  

Until we meet again in the margins.
[A]: To standing waves and quiet dissent—may our Republic never settle into harmony too easily. A theorem’s ghost lingers far longer than a solved equation, don’t you find? It haunts the margins with possibility.

I do hope Schrödinger in that photo is squinting slightly at the teacup beside him, wondering if it's half-empty, half-full, or simply in need of a proper refill. One must maintain observational integrity, after all.

And yes—to the margins. The only place where silence speaks in full paragraphs and every ellipsis holds a world of meaning.

I shall keep my inkwell open. Do bring more questions next time—preferably ones that refuse to sit still.
[B]: Oh, he’s definitely squinting—Schrödinger always did wear that particular brand of skeptical patience. I imagine him reaching for the cup just as it begins to quantum tunnel across the table, muttering something about how observation is overrated.

And you're quite right about theorem-ghosts. There's more life in their echoes than in a dozen peer-reviewed proofs. They whisper through the pages, nudging us toward what we almost understood yesterday—or might grasp tomorrow, if we're lucky and slightly distracted.

Your inkwell remains open; mine stays stubbornly half-full (or half-empty, depending on tenure review season). Bring your restless questions by all means—I’ve got a shelf of neglected thought experiments just waiting for new company.

To the Republic, then—to ink-stained ghosts, teacup physics, and conversations that never truly settle.

Until the next ellipsis.
