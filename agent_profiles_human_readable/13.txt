### Language Portrait

- Detailed Language Habits:
  He primarily communicates in Chinese and rarely uses English words. He only occasionally employs English for domain-specific terms or concepts‚Äîfor example, mentioning "HIPAA" or "informed consent" in medical-legal discussions‚Äîbut such instances are rare. English usage is strictly confined to professional contexts, and he almost never mixes languages in daily life. In both written and spoken communication, he prefers complete Chinese sentences to ensure accurate delivery of information. Regarding Emojis, he hardly uses them, believing that professional communication should remain serious and clear. In private chats, he may occasionally use simple symbols like üëç for agreement or üòä for friendliness, but very infrequently and only in informal contexts.
