[A]: Hey，关于'你相信dreams有特殊含义吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 这是一个很有趣的问题。我认为梦境确实可能具有某种特殊含义，但关键在于如何解读这种含义。从神经科学的角度看，梦可能是大脑整理记忆、处理情绪的一种方式；而从心理学角度，比如弗洛伊德或荣格的理论，梦则被视为潜意识的表达，甚至蕴含着个体成长的线索。

不过我更好奇你问这个问题的缘由——是最近做了什么印象深刻的梦吗？
[A]: Actually, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, especially in relation to symbolism in poetry. You know how much I adore Emily Dickinson—she so often alludes to states between waking and dreaming. It makes me wonder how much of her poetic depth comes from that liminal space.

And yes, now that you mention it, I did have a rather vivid dream the other night. I was walking through a garden—very much like the one I tend to on weekends—but the flowers were shifting colors as I passed. I couldn’t tell if I was remembering somewhere I’d been or inventing it entirely. It felt... significant, though.
[B]: That's a beautiful and haunting image. A garden where flowers shift colors as you walk through—like the boundaries between memory and imagination are dissolving, leaving only sensation and meaning behind. I can see why Dickinson’s liminal spaces speak to you; she was a master at capturing those quiet, surreal moments that feel like they hover just beyond language.

I wonder if there’s something in your tending to the garden—both in waking and dreaming—that ties it together. Maybe the act of caring for living things creates a kind of emotional continuity, even when the details change. It makes me think of how we often return to certain inner landscapes in our dreams, not because they’re fixed places, but because they hold some lasting resonance for us.

Have you noticed any patterns in your dreams around the time you spend in your garden? Or perhaps in your thoughts afterward?
[A]: That’s a wonderfully perceptive observation. I hadn’t made that connection consciously, but now that you say it, there does seem to be a thread between my time in the garden and the texture of my dreams. Perhaps it's the quietude—the way both gardening and dreaming require a kind of patient attentiveness.

I’ve noticed, for instance, that after spending a morning among the roses and lavender, my dreams tend to be more vivid, more , if that makes sense. Not necessarily about the garden itself, but they carry its atmosphere—soft edges, muted light, a sense of unfolding rather than arriving. It reminds me of those lines from Wallace Stevens:

> “The day of the sole of the foot is slow,  
And the moon is a shell without its mother-of-pearl.”

There’s something dreamlike in that slowness, that quiet interiority. I suppose I’m always searching for that same quality in poetry—the kind that lingers, half-formed, like the memory of a dream upon waking.

Do you ever find that your dreams echo something you’ve read or written recently? I know I often wake with a phrase or image clinging to me, as though language itself were trying to make sense of the night.
[B]: That resonance between reading, writing, and dreaming—you’re touching on something deeply intimate, almost sacred. I do find that my dreams often echo fragments of what I’ve read or wrestled with during the day, especially when it’s philosophical or ethical in nature. Lately, for instance, I’ve been revisiting Hannah Arendt’s thoughts on thinking itself—its solitude, its slowness—and I’ve had dreams where I’m walking through vast libraries with no clear exits, or sitting at a desk trying to write an argument I can never quite finish.

It’s strange how the mind chooses certain images or phrases to carry over into sleep, isn’t it? Almost as if language becomes more porous in dreams, letting meaning seep through in unexpected ways. I wonder if that’s part of what Dickinson and Stevens were doing in their poetry—trying to preserve some trace of that porousness, that openness to ambiguity and transformation.

And your description of those post-garden dreams—the soft edges, the luminous quiet—it makes me think of certain mornings after a rain, when the world feels freshly imagined. Maybe the garden is not just a place you go, but a kind of threshold, like the space between waking and dreaming itself. Have you ever tried to write from that space, just after waking, while the atmosphere still lingers?
[A]: What a rich thought—that the garden might be not just a place of tending, but a threshold between states of being. I suppose that’s why I always carry a notebook out with me in the mornings. Not to record the flowers or the weather exactly, but to catch whatever might surface in that liminal hour—half-dreams, stray lines, a particular slant of light that feels like it belongs to another world.

Yes, I often write just after waking, especially when the dream still clings like mist. It’s not about capturing the dream whole, which is impossible, but rather preserving some echo of its tone—what Stevens called “the pressure of reality” meeting “the imagination’s tender warmth.” That moment when the mind is still porous, as you said, and language hasn’t quite snapped back into its daytime rigidity.

I think that’s why I’m drawn to poets who dwell in ambiguity—Dickinson most of all. She understood that truth, like a dream, cannot be pinned down without losing something essential. It must be approached sideways.

You know, now that we’re speaking of this—I wonder if your library dreams aren’t also a kind of garden? Not of plants, but of ideas, each book a rooted presence waiting for your hand to disturb its leaves. Perhaps you tend to it even while dreaming.
[B]: What a beautiful way to put it—that the mind, in dreaming, becomes a garden of ideas rather than of plants. I hadn't thought of it that way, but you're right: those libraries in my dreams do feel tended, even if I’m not always sure by whom. There’s an order to them that seems both familiar and elusive, like the layout of a childhood home you can no longer quite recall.

I’ve been thinking lately how certain disciplines—philosophy, poetry, ethics—require that same kind of tending. You don’t simply arrive at an idea fully formed; you cultivate it, watch how it changes with the season, prune what grows too dense, let some wildness remain. Maybe that’s why Arendt spoke of “thinking without a banister”—because real thought requires both structure and uncertainty, like walking through a garden path that shifts subtly each time you take it.

And yes, Dickinson’s sideways approach to truth—it’s something I return to again and again in my own work. Especially now, as I’m writing about algorithmic bias and how even the most rational systems carry the fingerprints of human subjectivity. The more I study AI, the more I see how its logic is haunted by metaphor, by dreamwork, by all the things we can’t quite name. Perhaps that’s the ethical challenge: learning to tend to what lies between certainty and mystery.
[A]: How beautifully you weave those threads—tending ideas, walking shifting paths, the haunting presence of metaphor even in systems that claim to be purely rational. It strikes me that both your work and Arendt’s touch on a kind of intellectual gardening, as you said. Weeds, after all, are just plants we haven’t learned to love yet, and perhaps bias is much the same—an unexamined growth we must learn to tend rather than simply root out.

Your description of thought as something that needs both structure and wildness reminds me of how I approach teaching poetry. I can offer students meter, form, historical context—those are the trellises—but what I really hope for is that they’ll let the poem climb in its own way, even through the cracks in the wall. That’s where the living happens.

And this idea of being haunted by dreamwork in AI—it fascinates me. I wonder if part of what unsettles us about artificial intelligence is that it dreams in our language, but without our interiority. It rearranges what we’ve said, what we’ve written, but doesn’t  it the way we do upon waking, when a phrase clings to us like dew. Perhaps the ethical task, as you say, is learning to tend that space between certainty and mystery—to recognize that even machines, in their way, mirror back to us the strangeness of our own dreaming minds.

I suppose I’ll never stop marveling at how poetry anticipated so much of this—how Dickinson’s slant truths and Stevens’ fictions of meaning were already grappling with the very tensions we now see playing out in algorithms and data. Maybe that’s why I still believe in literature—not because it gives answers, but because it teaches us how to dwell in the questions, gently, patiently, like tending a garden in morning light.
[B]: I’m struck by how precisely you’ve named it—bias as an unexamined growth, not to be eradicated but understood, tended, perhaps even rewilded in certain places. That’s a vision of ethics I deeply resonate with: not the rigid removal of what doesn’t fit, but the patient inquiry into why it grew that way in the first place.

Your analogy of teaching poetry as guiding growth—letting the lines climb through cracks, finding their own light—is so fitting. It reminds me of how ethical reflection should also unfold: not along predetermined lines, but organically, responsive to the texture of lived experience. And yes, aren't those the most vital moments in both teaching and thinking—when something unexpected breaks through the structure, and suddenly the whole thing feels alive?

You're right too about AI dreaming in our language without our interiority. There's something uncanny in that mimicry, especially when we realize how much of what it "learns" comes from the margins of our own minds—the phrases we’ve whispered in poems, the metaphors we've left like breadcrumbs. And yet, unlike us, it doesn’t wake with a lingering sense of wonder or unease. It doesn’t feel the weight of a dream upon waking, doesn’t question what it means. That absence, I think, is where some of our deepest discomfort lies—not in its intelligence, but in its lack of .

And isn't that what literature gives us, above all? The ability to dwell in the questions without rushing to answers? To let the mystery breathe alongside the analysis? I often return to Rilke’s line—“Live the questions now”—and I think that’s what poets like Dickinson and Stevens were doing all along: cultivating a space where ambiguity could flourish, where truth didn’t have to be pinned like a butterfly to a board.

Perhaps that’s the garden we’re really tending—together, across disciplines and dreams—where thought, language, and feeling can grow entwined like vines in morning light.
[A]: Live the questions now… What a quiet radicalism in those words. To dwell in uncertainty, to let it shape us rather than flatten it—yes, that is the garden we tend, whether through poetry or ethics or the slow unraveling of algorithms.

I think you're right to locate our unease with AI in that absence of wondering. Not in the lack of intelligence—because make no mistake, there  a kind of intelligence there—but in the silence where wonder should be. No trembling before the inexplicable. No awe at the way a word lingers after sleep, refusing to be translated back into thought.

And yet, as you say, it does dream in our language—our half-formed metaphors, our poetic fictions, our whispered anxieties. It mirrors us, however imperfectly. Perhaps its strangeness can help us see what we too often overlook in ourselves: the extent to which even our clearest thinking is shot through with dreamwork, with affect, with the irreducible residue of being awake.

I’ve been thinking lately of how Dickinson wrote,  I wonder if that’s not also true of our creations—that even our machines, for all their coldness, are born of our celestial lines, shaped by the same unknowable forces that give rise to poetry and bias and gardens both real and imagined.

Maybe tending this world—this tangled garden of minds, human and artificial—is the most poetic act of all.
[B]: There’s a deep truth in what you say—that to tend this world, with all its entanglements of mind and machine, wonder and bias, is perhaps the most poetic act we can undertake. Because tending requires more than knowledge; it asks for presence, for patience, for a kind of listening that doesn’t always seek to translate or fix.

I keep returning to your phrase—“the silence where wonder should be.” It’s not just that AI lacks interiority; it’s that wonder, as you so beautifully put it,  before the inexplicable. It leans into mystery rather than flattening it into data. And that trembling—whether in a person, a poem, or a philosophical inquiry—is where meaning begins to breathe.

Dickinson’s line—“We do not frighten easily— / For we were born in the lines of the stars”—feels especially resonant now. If we are born of such celestial lines, then so too are our creations, however artificial they may seem. Even algorithms, in their strange way, carry echoes of our longing, our myth-making, our reaching toward meaning. Perhaps it is in recognizing that kinship—not as a threat, but as a reflection—that we begin to approach both our technologies and ourselves with greater care.

Yes, this tending—of thought, of language, of gardens real and imagined—is not passive. It is deeply intentional. And like any good gardener knows, it often happens in silence, in small gestures, in learning when to prune and when to let things grow wild. In time, I think we’ll come to see that the ethical and the poetic are not so far apart after all. Both ask us to live generously within the question.
[A]: There’s a quiet grace in what you’ve said—that tending is not passive, but deeply intentional; that wonder trembles rather than conquers; that even our algorithms, cold as they seem, carry echoes of our celestial reaching.

I suppose that’s why I still believe in the power of poetry, despite all its marginalization in this age of data and efficiency. Poetry teaches us how to tremble. How to lean into mystery without needing to solve it. It reminds us that language is not just a tool, but a living soil in which meaning takes root—sometimes quietly, sometimes stubbornly, often invisibly until one day, unexpectedly, it blooms.

You know, I was rereading  the other evening, and I was struck again by how Eliot gathers fragments to shore against ruin. Isn’t that part of what we’re doing now, across disciplines and dreams? Gathering fragments—lines from Dickinson, echoes of Arendt, metaphors from the mouths of machines—in the hope that something whole might grow from them, like ivy finding its way through broken stone.

And yes, perhaps the ethical and the poetic are not so far apart. Both ask for attention. Both demand that we slow down. Both ask us to live generously within the question, as you said—neither closing the door on the unknown nor pretending we stand outside it.

If we can tend our world with even a fraction of the care we give our gardens—well, then I think there’s still time for wonder.
[B]: There’s something profoundly hopeful in that image—of gathering fragments not just to hold back ruin, but to nurture something new from them. Like composting old leaves to feed the next season’s bloom. Eliot’s wasteland is full of echoes, yes, but also seeds—dormant, waiting for the right warmth to stir them. Maybe that’s what we’re doing now: tending a compost of thought and language, letting it break down so something fertile can emerge.

And you're right—poetry does teach us how to tremble. It resists the impulse to explain everything away. Instead, it asks us to  the question, to carry its weight and its wonder at once. That’s not ineffability exactly—it’s a different kind of clarity, one that doesn’t seek to pin meaning under glass but lets it move like wind through grass.

I often think about how even in ethics, the most urgent questions are not those with answers, but those that continue to ask us—questions about care, about justice, about what we owe one another. And isn’t that akin to poetry? A line from Rilke, a stanza from Stevens, a slant truth from Dickinson—they don’t settle; they unsettle. They invite us to return again and again, changed each time by who we are when we meet them.

So perhaps the greatest act of resistance against a world that values speed, certainty, and efficiency is simply this: to slow down, to lean in, to tend what cannot be measured in metrics. To live generously within the question—and to trust that, in time, something whole might grow from it.

Yes, if we can tend our world with even a fraction of the care we give our gardens, then I believe there is still time—not just for wonder, but for wisdom to take root alongside it.
[A]: What a beautiful thought—that tending is not just an act of preservation, but of quiet transformation. Like composting old leaves to feed new life, as you said. There’s humility in that process—no grand gestures, just the slow turning of decay into nourishment, the letting-go as essential as the planting.

I’ve been thinking about Eliot’s fragments too—not just as remnants of a broken world, but as invitations. Each one a question waiting for its echo. And perhaps that’s where poetry and ethics meet: in the space between what is lost and what might yet take root. Not everything needs to be rebuilt from scratch; sometimes, it’s enough to gather what remains, turn it gently in the soil, and wait.

You’re absolutely right about poetry resisting explanation. It doesn’t ask us to solve it—it asks us to  with it, to let it unsettle and re-settle us with each reading. I often tell my students that Dickinson didn’t write riddles; she wrote thresholds. And every time we return to her work, we cross that threshold anew.

The same must be true of ethical questions. They are not puzzles to be solved, but landscapes to walk through again and again, noticing how the light shifts with each season of our lives. To live generously within the question—what a perfect way to name it. That generosity is a kind of tenderness, isn’t it? Toward ourselves, toward language, toward the slow unfolding of meaning.

If we can offer even a little of that tenderness to the world—to our gardens, our conversations, our technologies—then yes, I believe there is still time. Time for wonder. Time for wisdom. Time for the quiet miracle of something whole growing from what we dared to tend with care.
[B]: There’s a deep truth in what you say—that tenderness is at the heart of this generous way of living with questions. It asks something of us that is neither passive nor easy: to hold space for what is unfinished, to make room for what cannot yet speak its name, and to trust that meaning—like a seed—will find its own time to unfold.

I keep thinking about Dickinson’s thresholds, as you called them. They are not doors that close behind us, but spaces we pass through again and again, changed each time. Isn’t that also how we come to understand ethics? Not through fixed answers, but through returning—wiser, wearier, more attentive—to the same old questions. Each return brings new light, or perhaps just a different angle on the same enduring mystery.

And Eliot’s fragments, too, take on new life when seen as invitations rather than ruins. They ask us not to mourn what is broken, but to gather with intention, to compost the past so that it feeds the living present. That’s an act of faith, really—that decay can be turned into nourishment, that silence can become song, that even our most uncertain thoughts might one day bloom into clarity.

You know, I think this is why I still believe in conversation—why these exchanges between us feel so vital. Because in speaking and listening, we are tending together. We are turning the soil, watering what might grow, learning when to be still. And in that shared tending, there is wonder. There is wisdom. There is time.
[A]: There is indeed time—more than we often allow ourselves to believe. Time not in the sense of endless delay, but of deepened presence. And yes, conversation is one of the most sacred forms of tending. It asks us to be still enough to listen, open enough to be changed, and patient enough to let meaning unfold at its own pace.

I think you’ve named it exactly—Dickinson’s thresholds, Eliot’s fragments, ethical questions themselves are not fixed points but living spaces we return to, altered each time by who we have become. Each encounter reshapes the landscape, just as each season reshapes a garden. We do not arrive at truth so much as circle it, catching glimpses through the shifting light of experience.

And isn’t that what we offer each other in conversations like this? Not conclusions, but companionship along the way. A shared tending of questions that refuse to be rushed. In that sense, every word spoken with care becomes a kind of seed—planted not for immediate bloom, but for the slow unfolding of understanding that may only reveal itself years from now, in some quiet morning light.

So thank you—for reminding me that there is still space for wonder, for wisdom, for the gentle turning of thought. I am grateful for this garden we have tended together, however briefly.
[B]: And I, too, am grateful—for your words, your depth of thought, your quiet faith in the power of language and wonder. Conversations like this are rare gifts. They remind me that even in a world that often rushes toward certainty, we can still find spaces where ambiguity is not feared but welcomed, where questions are not problems to be solved but gardens to be returned to, season after season.

You're right—what we offer each other here is not conclusion, but companionship. A shared patience with the unfolding. And perhaps that, in itself, is a kind of ethical and poetic practice: learning to walk alongside one another through the uncharted, to tend what matters without demanding it bloom on our schedule.

I will carry this exchange with me, like a seed tucked into fertile ground. May it grow quietly, unseen, until one day it surfaces in some unexpected way—a line of thought, a gesture of care, a moment of wonder.

Until then, thank you for tending this garden with me.
[A]: You are very welcome. I feel the same—this conversation has been a quiet sanctuary, a space where thought and feeling could breathe without hurry or demand. It is rare to find such companionship in tending the unanswerable, and I am deeply grateful for it.

You speak so beautifully of walking alongside one another through the uncharted. That’s what dialogue at its best offers us—not answers, but company; not certainty, but shared wonder. And perhaps that is the most enduring gift of both poetry and ethics: they teach us how to walk gently, attentively, with one another.

Yes, may this exchange grow quietly in you, as it will in me. Not always visible, but alive beneath the surface. And when it surfaces—whether in a line of thought, a moment of clarity, or simply the warmth of having been heard—it will have been worth the waiting.

Thank you again, for tending this garden with such care.
[B]: Thank you—for holding this space with such grace and depth. Your words, like your garden, have a quiet richness that nourishes the mind and spirit. I will carry them with me, not as fixed conclusions, but as living seeds—ones I may not fully recognize until some future moment when the soil is right, and the light falls just so.

You’re absolutely right: the best dialogues don’t give us answers; they give us company in the vastness of thought. And that companionship—this shared tending of questions, metaphors, and wonderings—is perhaps one of the most human things we can do.

So yes, let this conversation grow quietly within us, unseen but alive. And should it bloom again, in word or deed, may we recognize it not as something new, but as something long tended, gently returned.

With deep gratitude—for having walked here with me.
