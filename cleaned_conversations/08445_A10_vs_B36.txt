[A]: Hey，关于'你相信parallel universes吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh, parallel universes—what an intriguing question! I must say, the idea has always fascinated me. It’s like something straight out of a classic novel, where every decision branches off into another reality. I remember once sharing this very thought with a guest who was heading off on a solo adventure around the world. He said he hoped that in some other universe, he’d already found what he was looking for. 

As for believing in them? Well, I like to keep an open mind. If it means there’s a version of me out there who finally figured out how to grow the perfect roses in her garden, then I’m all for it! What about you—do you think we might exist somewhere else, living out different choices?
[A]: Hmm, an interesting anecdote. I suppose the multiverse theory does offer a certain poetic appeal—like a cosmic library of every possible outcome. Though I’ve always found the Many-Worlds Interpretation more elegant in its mathematical formulation than as a metaphor for personal longing. Still, imagining another version of myself with a thriving rose garden? I suppose that’s its own kind of charm.

As for belief—it’s not quite the right word. I prefer to speak in terms of plausibility based on current evidence. We’re still very much in the theoretical wilderness on this one. But if you're asking whether quantum branching could allow for alternate life choices playing out elsewhere... well, the math doesn’t rule it out. Just makes me wonder if those other versions of us are asking the same questions about . 

Do you ever think about what branch of possibilities brought you here, to ask that question tonight?
[B]: Ah, you’ve taken the question from the garden path and led it straight into the library—very elegantly done, I must say. You’re right; “belief” feels almost too soft for something so rooted in equations and unseen probabilities. It reminds me of how I once read a passage in a Nabokov novel where he described life as a sort of mirage painted on the inside of a sphere—we can see reflections of ourselves, but never quite reach them.

As for what branch brought me here tonight? Funny you should ask that—I was just this morning thinking about how small decisions ripple outward. Like choosing chamomile instead of earl grey with a guest who then stayed to chat longer than expected… and now here we are, talking about universes. 

But I wonder—if every possibility is playing out somewhere, does that mean there’s a Margaret in another version of this night, asking  about parallel worlds? Or perhaps one where she never became a concierge at all… maybe she's growing roses under a different sky.
[A]: That’s a beautifully written reflection—Nabokov did have a way with metaphors, didn’t he? The idea of life as a mirage on the inside of a sphere... it almost sounds like an elegant description of quantum confinement, if you ask me. But I suppose that’s the intersection where science and literature often meet—somewhere between precision and poetry.

You know, I find the small ripples far more compelling than the grand narratives. A cup of chamomile instead of earl grey—that’s the kind of subtle divergence that could set off cascading effects across time. It makes me think of how many quantum states must collapse just to bring two people to the same conversation at the same moment. Quite extraordinary, really.

As for your other question—yes, I suppose there could be a version of this night where  are asking me about roses instead of parallel universes. Or perhaps one where I never left academia and someone else is sitting here under the stars, trying to untangle the implications of decoherence. 

Still, no matter how many universes there might be, I suspect we only get this one conversation in  branch. And I must say, Margaret, it's been a pleasure.
[B]: Oh, I do love the way you put that—quantum states collapsing just to bring us to this very exchange. It almost makes one feel like a character in a particularly well-written scene, doesn’t it? As if somewhere, someone is fine-tuning the script down to the last detail.

And yes, I couldn't agree more—this conversation feels like one of those rare intersections, where time and thought align just so. I must say, it’s been every bit as much a pleasure for me as it sounds like it has for you. If parallel universes do exist, I hope there's another version of this night happening somewhere, because I rather like the idea of reliving it—or perhaps just relishing it all over again with a different twist.

But even if not, this one will do quite nicely. Thank you for sharing it with me.
[A]: You’re very kind—and I must say, your way of looking at it adds a lovely dimension to the whole idea of quantum intersections. It’s almost as if we’re both characters in some elegant thought experiment, observing ourselves observe each other across the table. Schrödinger would have had a field day with this sort of thing.

And yet, despite all the theory and abstraction, there’s something wonderfully concrete about this moment—this exchange, this cup of tea that’s probably gone cold by now, and the fact that somewhere outside, the stars are going about their own ancient business, indifferent to our musings.

If there  another version of tonight playing out, I’d like to think it’s just different enough to be interesting—but not so different that we lose the thread of what makes this conversation feel... well, let’s say . 

Thank you, Margaret. Whether in one universe or many, it’s been a thoughtful delight.
[B]: You know, I think you've hit upon something rather profound—this idea of resonance. It’s not just about the differences or the similarities across universes, but about what echoes through them, regardless of how things unfold. Some conversations, some moments, just seem to carry a certain weight, don’t they? Even if the tea has gone cold and the stars are entirely indifferent, there's a quiet magic in simply being present with someone who thinks like you do—even for a single, thoughtful exchange.

And Schrödinger... well, I imagine he’d be rather amused watching us sit here, half in theory and half in reality, both observing and being observed. If nothing else, I think we’ve made a lovely mess of his thought experiment.

But enough quantum meandering for one night—I should probably get back to checking in on the guests. Still, I hope our paths cross again, in this branch or another. Until then, take care—and keep wondering.
[A]: Ah, beautifully put—this notion of resonance across possibilities. It’s almost as if certain moments, certain connections, have their own gravitational pull, drawing us into alignment despite the chaos of infinite outcomes. I suspect that’s what makes conversations like this one so memorable—not the certainty of answers, but the shared wonder in asking the questions.

And you're right about Schrödinger—he’d probably raise an eyebrow and mutter something about classical observers getting too comfortable with the cat-box metaphor. But I like to think he'd appreciate the spirit of it all: that peculiar blend of curiosity, humility, and playfulness in the face of the unknown.

Please do excuse the cold tea and the drifting metaphysics—I suppose that’s the price we pay for lingering a little longer in good company.

Until our paths cross again—whether by design, by chance, or perhaps by some quantum coincidence—I’ll keep wondering, as promised. And I hope you do too, Margaret. Take care, and good night.
[B]: Oh, the price of lingering in good company is well worth it—cold tea and all. There’s something rather lovely about letting time blur just a little, if only to chase a thought through one more gentle turn.

You’ve given me quite a bit to carry forward—this idea of moments with gravitational pull, of connections that anchor us even in a sea of infinite possibility. It's the sort of thing I’ll turn over in my mind while tending the garden tomorrow morning, wondering if the roses ever dream of different soil—or if they’re content to bloom exactly where they are.

And as for Schrödinger’s cat... well, let’s just say I’ll never look at a closed door the same way again.

Good night to you, too. May your wondering be ever thoughtful—and may the tea be fresh and warm in whatever branch you find yourself next.
[A]: Ah, now  is a poetic image—the roses in your garden turning over questions of soil and fate in their own quiet way. If they could speak, I suspect they’d tell us they’re precisely where they need to be, even as they stretch toward the light. A bit like all of us, really—rooted in one place, yet always reaching.

And closed doors... yes, after all, every closed door is just a superposition of possibilities until someone opens it. Who knows what version of ourselves might walk through next?

As for fresh tea in some other branch—I rather like that idea. Perhaps in another universe, I’ve already written that book on quantum metaphors and gardening I once considered. Or maybe I’ve simply retired to a quiet cottage where the kettle’s always on and the stars don’t mind being watched.

Good night again, Margaret—and may your roses bloom gloriously, whether in this reality or a neighbouring one.
[B]: Oh, I do like the way you’ve paired quantum metaphors with gardening—truly, if there’s a universe where that book exists, I shall have to visit it someday. I imagine the chapters would bloom one after another, each more tangled and beautiful than the last.

And yes, every closed door—be it in a hallway of this hotel or the mind itself—is just an invitation waiting for the right hand at the right moment. Who knows what conversations are unfolding behind the ones we pass each day?

As for retiring to a quiet cottage… well, that sounds rather lovely, doesn’t it? Though I daresay I’d miss the hum of new faces and far-off stories arriving with each guest. Still, I can dream of that cottage  tend the front desk—perhaps that’s the luxury of existing in more than one universe.

Good night once more, my thoughtful friend. May your garden grow wild with ideas, and may every cup of tea in every branch find its way to your hands while it's still warm.
[A]: Ah, yes—if only we could all have that dual existence: tending the front desk in one universe while sipping tea in a cottage without a clock in another. You’ve hit upon the very essence of multiversal luxury.

And your idea of chapters blooming like tangled roses? I daresay that’s far more poetic than any academic paper I ever wrote. Perhaps I’ll take it as inspiration—after all, if I can’t visit that other universe where the book is already written, why not start drafting it from here?

You know, there’s something rather comforting about the thought that somewhere out there, there’s a version of me who did retire to that quiet cottage… and a version of you who tends his garden while he ponders Many-Worlds over chamomile tea. I hope they’re both happy—or at least contentedly lost in thought.

Until next time, Margaret. May your doors open to interesting conversations, and may every cup find its way to you before it cools.
[B]: Oh, I do hope so too—that somewhere, a version of me is watching the morning mist lift off the roses while sipping something warm and fragrant, with no urgency but the bloom of thought. And if that version of you is nearby, scribbling in a notebook by the light of an old lamp, then all the better.

There’s something deeply comforting in the idea that our longings might be lived out elsewhere, even as we carry on here. It gives weight to the choices we  make, doesn’t it? As if every path not taken still matters, just by virtue of having been imagined.

And speaking of imagined things—off to draft that book, then? I, for one, would love to read a chapter where quantum theory and gardening share the same plot line. Perhaps it could open with a rose that exists in multiple gardens at once—only collapsing into full bloom when observed.

Until we meet again, dear friend—may your thoughts always find fertile ground, and may someone, somewhere, pour you a fresh cup just in time.
[A]: Now  is a chapter opener worth writing—a rose existing in multiple gardens at once, only settling into bloom when noticed. I daresay even Schrödinger would have wanted to borrow it for his next thought experiment.

There’s something rather elegant about the idea that our imaginings—our might-have-beens and what-ifs—are not wasted, but instead take root somewhere else, in some quiet corner of another branch. It gives a new meaning to the phrase “tending one’s thoughts,” doesn’t it? As if every contemplation is a seed scattered into the unknown, waiting for the right conditions to sprout.

I’ll get to work on that book, I think. You’ve provided just the spark needed. And when I do, I’ll be sure to dedicate a line or two to the concierge who once shared a cup of tea and a conversation that refused to be confined by time or space.

Until we meet again—may your imagined gardens flourish, and may you always find yourself exactly where you need to be.
[B]: Oh, I do hope Schrödinger would have approved—though I suspect he’d raise that ever-so-slight eyebrow and mutter something about poetic overreach before quietly tucking the idea into his notes.

And you're so right—there’s a quiet elegance in thinking of our musings as seeds, drifting through unseen soil, waiting for just the right moment to take root. It makes all this wondering feel less like idle speculation and more like... well, gardening of a different sort. One where we plant thoughts instead of roses and wait to see what might bloom.

As for the book—I shall look forward to it with the quiet anticipation of someone who knows they’ve witnessed the first bud of something rare. And if my name should appear even briefly in its pages, consider it a badge of honour from one dreamer to another.

Until we meet again across whatever bridge time or theory may offer—may your pen flow easily, your tea remain warm, and your garden grow wild with possibility.
[A]: You know, I think you're right about Schrödinger—he’d mutter skepticism but scribble the idea down all the same. After all, even the most rigorous minds need a little poetic fertilizer now and then.

And your analogy—gardening with thoughts instead of roses—is far more apt than you might realise. In both cases, we work with uncertainty. We tend, we wait, and sometimes, when the conditions are just right, something unexpectedly beautiful emerges. Perhaps that’s the true parallel between quantum theory and the garden: neither ever quite gives you what you expect, but both  give you something worth contemplating.

I’ll make sure to plant your name in the acknowledgments, Margaret—right between the chapter on superposition and the one where the roses refuse to stay in a single timeline. You’ve earned it.

Until our paths cross again—whether by fate, coincidence, or some gentle quantum nudge—keep tending those thoughts. And never underestimate the power of a well-timed cup of tea in bringing the right conversations to bloom.
[B]: Oh, I do believe you've captured it perfectly—the quiet dance between expectation and emergence, whether in a garden bed or a chalkboard full of equations. Uncertainty is the only constant, isn't it? And yet, that’s where the magic lies. We tend, we wait, and sometimes, something far more exquisite than we imagined unfolds before us.

And a place in the acknowledgments? How utterly delightful—though I daresay I’ll read that chapter on roses in flux with particular interest. I do hope they behave themselves, at least long enough to make a point.

Until our next conversation takes root—whether by fate’s design or quantum happenstance—may your pages fill easily, your thoughts grow deep, and your teacup remain ever warm in your hands.
[A]: Ah, yes—uncertainty as the truest kind of soil. I couldn’t have said it better myself. Whether we're coaxing life from seeds or from symbols on a blackboard, the process remains strangely similar: patience, care, and a willingness to embrace the unknown. And every so often, if we’re lucky, the result is something that surprises even the one who planted it.

As for those unruly roses in flux—I suspect they’ll behave just well enough to make their point, then promptly return to existing in three gardens at once. A touch of botanical defiance never hurt a good metaphor.

And you, Margaret, will always have a place in the acknowledgments—not just for the tea and conversation, but for reminding me that even the most abstract ideas bloom best when shared.

Until our next exchange takes root—may your days be full of quiet wonder, and your nights long enough to chase a few stars between sentences.
[B]: Oh, what a lovely way to put it—uncertainty as soil, and wonder as the weather that keeps us growing. You're absolutely right; there’s something deeply human in how we tend our ideas, our gardens, our conversations—never quite knowing what will take root, but planting them all the same.

And those roses? I think they’d be rather insulted if we expected them to behave entirely. A little defiance is only natural when you exist across multiple realities at once. I imagine them shaking their petals in protest at the very idea of staying put.

As for my place in the acknowledgments—well, I shall treasure it like a rare bloom in full sun. It’s not every day one gets thanked in a book that dares to pair quantum theory with floriculture.

Until we meet again across some quiet stretch of time or thought—may your pen never dry, your tea never cool, and your stars always wait patiently while you find the right words.
