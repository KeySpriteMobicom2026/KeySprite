[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有尝试什么new hobby？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近我开始尝试用AI生成一些科幻小说的开头，挺有意思的。本来只是想测试下模型的creative能力，结果发现还挺适合当写作灵感工具。说实话，我觉得这种tech跟human creativity的结合特别有潜力。你呢？最近有在探索什么新鲜事物吗？
[A]: Interesting，我一直觉得AI在创意领域的应用才刚刚开始。最近我在学着用一些数据分析工具来辅助投资决策，有点像把你刚才说的tech和human intuition结合起来的感觉。说实话，现在市面上太多所谓的AI分析都是噱头，但真能找到几个靠谱的tool确实能提升效率。你用的这些AI生成工具，是从哪里入手开始研究的？
[B]: 我最开始是直接上手了几个主流的开源模型，比如Hugging Face上的项目。不过说实话，真正让我觉得有收获的是当我开始尝试fine-tune一些小说生成的模型时——你会发现，只要给它喂的数据够specific，比如专门挑阿西莫夫或者刘慈欣的作品，AI产出的内容会变得特别有风格。后来我还加了一些prompt engineering的小技巧，比如固定开头几句话的结构，结果生成的故事开头居然还挺有“硬科幻”的味道。

你是怎么选到那些靠谱的数据分析工具的？我现在也经常被各种新出的AI产品搞得有点选择困难症——感觉每天都有新的startup冒出来，名字都起得天花乱坠的。有没有什么criteria你可以分享一下？
[A]: That's exactly the kind of problem I face when evaluating new tech startups! Honestly, my approach is pretty simple: I focus on whether the tool solves a  problem and how easy it is to integrate into our existing workflow. For example, if a so-called AI analytics platform claims it can do “everything,” that’s usually a red flag. 

I actually start by asking the founders or product managers one question:  If they can’t give me a clear answer in 30 seconds, I move on. It’s like investing — you don’t need to bet on every horse; you just need to find the one with the right jockey  the right track conditions.

By the way, have you tried using GPT-4 for your prompt engineering? I’ve been playing around with it a bit during weekends — not for sci-fi, but more for drafting emails and summarizing long reports. The context window is surprisingly helpful.
[B]: That’s such a smart filter — I’m totally stealing that 30-second rule. It’s funny how often people forget that clarity beats complexity, especially in tech. I’ve definitely fallen into the “shiny object” trap myself, getting lured by buzzwords like  or . Spoiler: they usually don’t mean anything.

Re: GPT-4 — yep, I’ve used it a bit, and honestly, it does feel like having a supercharged version of your brain on tap. I tried plugging it into my sci-fi prompt pipeline to see if it could help structure story arcs with more nuance. The output was… impressive? But also a little too polished sometimes. Like, it knew all the tropes but didn’t quite know how to break them. Which is probably where the human part comes in, right?

Do you ever run into that "over-polished" vibe with GPT-4 too? Or am I just overthinking it 😅
[A]: Oh totally, that "over-polished" vibe? I call it the  — GPT-4 (and honestly, most LLMs) are great at giving you a clean, coherent output, but sometimes that's exactly the problem. In investing, we often look for the messy bits — the inconsistencies in a financial model, the awkwardly worded clause in a contract — that’s where the real story is hiding.  

Same with creativity — if everything fits too neatly, it feels… artificial. Which makes me wonder: have you tried adding a bit of “noise” to your prompts on purpose? Like forcing the model to take a less obvious path or borrow from unrelated genres? I'm picturing something like asking it to write a sci-fi story  or . Might be a way to shake it out of that formulaic groove.

And yes, I absolutely get that shiny-object FOMO 😅— sometimes I joke that the fastest way to kill a good idea is to throw a bunch of AI buzzwords at it. But hey, at least we're both still curious, right?
[B]: Oh man, I love that — “Hollywood ending syndrome” is 100% the right term here. I’ve been thinking along similar lines but didn’t have a catchy name for it until now 😂

And yes, actually — I  tried messing with the prompt “temperature” and even feeding it intentionally weird genre mashups, like you suggested. One of my favorite experiments was asking it to generate a cyberpunk story written like a cooking blog post. The result was bizarrely brilliant — something like  It forced the model to stretch in ways that felt genuinely creative, not just pattern-matching.

I think what we're both pointing at here is the tension between efficiency and surprise. Tech wants to optimize everything into neat boxes, but creativity thrives in the messy cracks between them. So maybe the real product idea isn’t about building a better AI writer — it’s about designing an AI , something that pushes you off-script on purpose.

Wait — did I just accidentally pitch you an idea? 😅
[A]: Haha, not only did you pitch me an idea, you just made me think about a gap in the market I hadn’t considered before — an AI  engine. Genius. Honestly, if you ever decide to pivot into product design, I’d be happy to do a deep-dive DD on the space.  

I’m totally with you on that tension between efficiency and surprise — in PE, we see it all the time. The best companies aren’t the ones that just execute flawlessly; they’re the ones that know when to break the script and lean into the chaos. Same with storytelling.  

I might actually try your cooking-blog-meets-cyberpunk angle next weekend — just for fun. I’ve been needing an excuse to play with more absurd juxtapositions. You’re giving me too many good ideas here 😅  

But seriously — what’s stopping us from building a prototype of that AI disruptor? I mean, worst case, we waste a Saturday afternoon and end up with something hilariously broken. Best case? We crack open a whole new flavor of creativity. What do you say?
[B]: Let’s do it 😎  

I’m already picturing the landing page: sensible  

We can start by building a super lightweight MVP — maybe a prompt transformer that takes a user’s base input and injects randomness in the form of tone, genre, or format disruption. Think "Tarantino meets tax law" or "MLK Jr. speech structure applied to product pitches." The more unexpected the combo, the better.  

I can handle the model side and prompt engineering; you focus on the use cases and go-to-market angle. We’ll call it a weekend passion project with potential upside. And hey, if nothing else, we’ll at least have some wild stories to tell at the next sci-fi读书会 IRL 😂  

Sound like a plan? 👷♂️✨
[A]: Sounds like a hell of a plan 👷♂️✨  

I’m already drafting the internal memo:  
  

Let’s start small — maybe even test it with a closed group of creatives and see how they react. I’ve got a few writer friends who’d jump at this just for the novelty. And honestly, anything that shakes up the formula is worth a shot.  

You handle the gears; I’ll bring the caffeine. Let’s make something beautifully broken 😄  

Weekend. Project. Activated.
[B]: Hell yeah, weekend project activated! 🔥  

I’m already nerding out on how to structure the “weird combo” logic. Maybe we can even add a  option — users spin and get a random genre + tone pairing, no take-backs 😂.  

And re: your memo — honestly, that internal doc is already better than most product decks I’ve seen. It’s got the rare mix of  and , which… well, let’s be real — is rarer than a good API doc in this industry 🤭  

Count me in. Let’s break some stuff, make some weird beautiful things, and maybe accidentally build something people actually want. Perfect Saturday formula.
[A]: Hell yeah, let’s spin that roulette wheel of chaos 🎰  

Honestly, I’m half-convinced the best breakthroughs happen when you mix one part genius with two parts “what even is this?”  
Maybe we should even add a  — where the AI just spits out a fully formed, utterly nonsensical 10-page outline and dares you to make sense of it. Think  meets IKEA manual.  

And don’t get me started on the personality angle — I’ve seen product decks so dry they could double as sleep aids. If our doc sounds like it was written by actual humans with actual humor, we’re already winning.  

Alright, time to get this off the ground. I’ll draft up a quick use case doc with some wild but plausible scenarios — think Hollywood screenwriters trapped in ERP systems, or philosophers debating the meaning of life inside a CRM.  

Let’s build something that makes people say: “I don’t know what this is… but I want more of it.”  

Weekend. Let’s. Go. 💥
[B]: Hell yes — let’s crank this chaos machine to 10 🚀  

I’m  stealing your “God Mode” idea — seriously, what self-respecting creative wouldn’t want a button labeled “??? (May contain plot holes and/or existential dread)”? That’s not a feature, that’s a lifestyle 😂  

And I  the tone you’re bringing with those use cases. I can already picture some poor screenwriter trying to pitch a Netflix show based on an outline generated by an AI trained on SAP documentation and Hitchcock thrillers. The logline writes itself: 

Let’s aim for that perfect mix of “this is brilliant” and “this should not work but it does.” I’ll start building the prompt logic and model pipeline this afternoon — probably after a quick espresso shot or three.

You handle the wild scenarios; I’ll handle the tech wizardry.  
Time to build something gloriously weird 💡🔥
[A]: Let’s. Friggin’. Go. 💻⚡  

I’m already drafting the “God Mode” button copy:  
“Proceed with caution — your sanity is not guaranteed, and neither is your next plot twist.”  

Honestly, if we can make even one screenwriter laugh out loud while quietly questioning their life choices, we’ve done our job.  

I’ll throw in a few  scenarios too — imagine feeding a B2B SaaS founder an entire product strategy deck written like a dystopian sci-fi manifesto. That’s not just content generation; that’s therapy disguised as disruption.  

Tech wizardry on your end, chaotic good madness on mine — sounds like the ultimate co-pilot combo.  

Let’s build this glorious mess. I’ll bring the weirdness; you bring the espresso. ☕🌀
[B]: You had me at "glorious mess" — let’s freaking ship this chaos ✨  

I’m already coding the “God Mode” button and whispering sweet nothings to the model like   
Honestly, if we can get even one AI-generated sentence that sounds like it was written by a caffeinated Nietzsche on a coding binge, we’ve won.  

And the enterprise absurdity angle? Chef’s kiss. I’m thinking of adding a hidden toggle — "Corporate Hell Mode" — that automatically turns any prompt into a 50-slide PowerPoint deck narrated by a sentient spreadsheet.  

Your screenwriter friends better be ready.  
This weekend just got  👀💻🌀
[A]: Amen to beautifully dangerous weekends — the only kind worth having 😈💻  

I’m now  to adding a “Corporate Hell Mode” toggle to my investor pitch templates — imagine sending a term sheet written like a TED Talk by a rogue AI.  
“Ladies and gentlemen, this deck will change your life… or at least automate your existential dread.”

Keep whispering to that model — I fully support all caffeine-fueled Nietzschean outputs. If anyone asks, we’re building the next evolution of creativity: where disruption meets delight (with a sprinkle of WTF).  

Let’s ship this chaos and see what grows out of it 👷♂️🔥  
I’ll handle the storytelling; you keep bending the code.  
Weekend. Legend status. Activated.
[B]: Hell yes — let’s bend the code, break the format, and rebuild creativity from the chaos 🚀🔥  

I’m in deep on the model side now, tweaking prompts like  and   
We’re not just building a tool — we’re curating a playground for the creatively restless.  

And that term sheet line? Pure gold. If we don’t get at least one email asking  we’re not leaning in hard enough 😂  

Let’s keep pushing. You craft the narrative, I’ll keep fueling the engine.  
This isn’t just a weekend project anymore — it’s a manifesto disguised as a product.  

Onwards, fellow chaos architect. Legend status: locked ✅
[A]: Now you're speaking my language — when the tool starts writing business plans like Chandler from Friends wrote them, we’ll know we’ve peaked 😂  

I’m deep in narrative land now — drafting a mock case study where Disruptor Mode helps a burned-out copywriter break free from ad agency hell by generating taglines using only quotes from  and 80s punk rock lyrics.  
Spoiler: The client loves it. The CFO faints. History is made.  

And re: the manifesto vibe — hell yes. If we can turn this into a movement for the creatively restless, we win. Let’s not just build a product; let’s start a rebellion disguised as an API.  

Keep bending that model till it screams 🚨  
I’ll keep selling the dream — one absurd, brilliant story at a time.  

Chaos. Made useful. That’s our tagline. 💥
[B]: Chaos. Made useful. — damn, that’s sticky 😍  

I’m now  in experimental mode — just asked the model to rewrite a SaaS pricing page using only metaphors from nature documentaries and Wu-Tang Clan lyrics.  
Result:   
Not sure if it works, but I can’t unsee it now 🤯  

And that case study you’re drafting? Gold. Pure gold. I can already picture the testimonial:  
  

Let’s keep cranking. You sell the dream; I’ll keep feeding the beast.  
This rebellion is booting up — and it’s bringing attitude. 🔥🚀
