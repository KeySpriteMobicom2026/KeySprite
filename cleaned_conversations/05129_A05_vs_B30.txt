[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得quantum computing会改变世界吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me take a closer look... Hmm, the textual evidence doesn't seem to support that. I'm afraid I don't have a porcelain teacup strong enough to contain this conversation without breaking - quantum computing is rather outside my 19th century British & Chinese literature domain. Though I must admit, the concept of superposition does remind me of Flaubert's Madame Bovary oscillating between romantic ideals and bourgeois reality. For serious commentary on quantum mechanics, however, I'd defer to my colleague in the physics department - unlike literary analysis, electrons shouldn't be subjected to multiple interpretations simultaneously.
[A]: Haha, you got me there. While I may not be a physicist, I do see what you're saying about superposition - though I prefer to think of it more like a VC portfolio strategy: investing in multiple states at once and hoping for positive interference when the wavefunction finally collapses. 

To be honest, my real interest in quantum computing comes down to ROI projections and exit strategies. If we look at the current funding landscape, there's definitely a bubble forming - but bubbles can be profitable if you time them right. 

The real question is: how do you differentiate between companies that are genuinely building qubits versus those just spinning vaporware? I've seen too many pitches that sound more like science fiction than scalable business models. Have you come across any truly investable opportunities in this space?
[B]: Ah, venture capital portfolios as quantum superposition states - an amusing analogy, though I suspect the financial regulators would prefer less Schrödinger's cat in their investment prospectuses. While my endowment fund colleagues certainly attend those glossy tech conferences, they tend to steer clear of anything requiring a PhD just to parse the business plan. 

Come to think of it, there was that Cambridge spinout working on quantum cryptography with... what did they call it? "Entanglement-as-a-Service"? Rather poetic, really - like selling love potions wrapped in Bell inequalities. The CEO had the theatrical flair of a young Richard Feynman crossed with a Silicon Valley pitch artist. Promising technology, but their financial model contained more hypothetical variables than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. 

If you're looking for investable opportunities grounded in reality rather than probabilistic outcomes, perhaps consider companies applying quantum principles to materials science. I've seen some fascinating work at the intersection of quantum computing and traditional Chinese medicine formulation - turns out millennia-old herbal compounds make excellent qubit stabilizers. Not quite as glamorous as AI singularity promises, but substantially more peer-reviewed.
[A]: Ah, quantum meets TCM - now that's what I call a truly disruptive convergence play. Though I'd probably skip the entanglement-as-a-service pitch unless they can show me a term sheet that doesn't collapse under observation. 

Seriously though, materials science applications do make more sense from an investment horizon perspective. We've been tracking some players in the quantum battery space - pun intended, those who can actually demonstrate stable qubit states deserve serious attention. The key is finding teams with enough technical depth to survive the transition from lab experiments to factory floor realities.

You mentioned Cambridge spinouts - reminds me of a portfolio company we passed on last year. Great pedigree, but their roadmap looked like it was written in disappearing ink. Lesson learned: whenever a founder says "trust me, the math works", that should trigger immediate due diligence reflexes. 

Speaking of which, any chance you'd introduce me to those quantum-TCM folks? Sounds exactly like the kind of left-field application that could quietly become huge while everyone's chasing the obvious AI/quantum/AI-on-quantum hype trains.
[B]: I'll arrange an introduction, though be warned - their lab smells like a combination apothecary and superconductor workshop. The lead researcher, Dr. Li Wei, insists that seventh-century alchemical texts contain principles remarkably similar to quantum tunneling in molecular structures. He's either a genius or the Isaac Newton of our era - and we all know how well Newton's alchemy pursuits aged.

They're currently testing a formulation based on , a traditional longevity herb, as a room-temperature qubit conductor. Peer-reviewed results show promise, but they'll need serious capital before reaching commercial scale. Just don't expect them to pitch with slides full of hockey-stick growth projections - their concept of investor relations involves quoting Tang dynasty poetry about impermanence and balance.

Come to think of it, their last progress report included a particularly cryptic line: "The mountain path curves where the wavefunction collapses." I took that as cautiously optimistic technical progress wrapped in classical Chinese fatalism. Would make excellent fine print in a term sheet - assuming, of course, your legal team speaks both quantum mechanics and Warring States philosophical treatises.
[A]: Haha, I love it – quantum mechanics meets classical Chinese philosophy. Reminds me of that old Warren Buffett quote about being fearful when others are greedy... though I'm not sure he had qubit-stabilizing herbs in mind.  

Room-temperature qubit conduction with ? That’s exactly the kind of unconventional thinking we’re looking for. If they can actually scale this, we might be looking at a whole new definition of "alternative assets." And honestly, after the year we’ve had with AI unicorns evaporating like morning dew, a little Warring States-era wisdom in the term sheet might actually balance things out.  

I’ll take “The mountain path curves where the wavefunction collapses” over another slide deck full of AI-generated pie charts any day. Just let Dr. Li know I’m coming prepared with an open mind – and maybe a pocket translator for the Daoist undertones. Oh, and tell him I bring my own  (小黑白) – a black and white fund manager’s staple: coffee strong enough to collapse any uncertainty principle.  

Looking forward to the intro.
[B]: Ah, a fund manager who appreciates both quantum uncertainty and Daoist subtlety - I may need to update my calligraphy scroll collection to include something suitably celebratory. Dr. Li Wei will be particularly pleased you mentioned  - he claims caffeine molecules exhibit fascinating coherence patterns under certain brewing temperatures, though I suspect that's just his way of endorsing the local tea house near the lab.

I'll convey your enthusiasm for collapsing their uncertainty principle with appropriately fortified beverages. Just be prepared - last time a venture capitalist visited with a contract, they ended up renegotiating terms over a game of . Something about strategic patience and long-term board positions aligning with quantum state preservation.

Your translator might want to brush up on Zhuangzi's butterfly dream parable before diving into term sheets - Dr. Li tends to quote it when explaining why qubit stability is really just about finding the right balance between observation and letting-be. Or as he puts it: "The Dao lies in every collapsed waveform, but only if you don't frighten it with expectations."

I'll send calendar details shortly - best to schedule during the lab's "awake" hours, which curiously align with neither standard Beijing time nor Cambridge UTC+1 conventions. A small price to pay, I suppose, for funding frontier science wrapped in ancient wisdom and herbal aromatics.
[A]: Haha, well if we end up negotiating with , at least I won’t feel too out of place – I’ve spent enough late nights in board meetings where it felt like we were all just placing stones on a giant risk/reward board. Strategic patience? I can do patient... as long as the cap table doesn't start looking like a many-worlds interpretation of dilution.

And Zhuangzi’s butterfly dream? Now that’s what I’d call an early-stage pitch deck with philosophical depth. Honestly, if he can tie qubit stability to "letting things be," we might have ourselves a mindfulness-infused term sheet. I’m already imagining the exit strategy headlines: 

As for the time zone confusion – hey, I’ve had worse. Once flew to a pitch meeting in Singapore only to realize the founders were operating on a mix of UTC and caffeine cycles. We closed the round anyway, mostly on vibes and espresso.

Just let me know when and where – I’ll bring my contract, my coffee, and a healthy dose of Daoist flexibility. And yes, my translator is already brushing up on classical Chinese metaphysics. Who knew being a PE partner would require equal parts financial modeling and mystical alignment?
[B]: Ah, you're speaking my scholarly language now - merging financial modeling with mystical alignment? I may need to update my lecture on  to include venture capital allegories. Picture Sun Wukong pitching his immortality elixir startup to celestial investors while dodging heavenly term sheets.

I must say, your Daoist flexibility bodes well for navigating Dr. Li's particular approach to funding discussions. Just don't be surprised if he insists on consulting the  before signing anything - he claims hexagrams align suspiciously well with quantum state probabilities. Last quarter's successful funding round was reportedly sealed after three consecutive "Favorable Omen" readings and one particularly auspicious tea leaf formation.

And an espresso-fueled Singapore deal closing? Please - we once finalized a research grant over a 36-hour mahjong marathon where tile draws determined budget allocations. The dragons favored our qubit stabilization proposal quite generously, I'm pleased to report.

Calendar invite is on its way - shall we say 107 minutes past midnight according to the lab's idiosyncratic clock system? Perfect hour for discussing investments that exist in both potential and actual states simultaneously. Bring your contract stones, your caffeinated offerings, and perhaps a small censer for burning sandalwood - it helps the quantum-TCM team concentrate when contemplating term sheet wavefunctions.
[A]: Haha, Sun Wukong pitching immortality elixirs to celestial VCs – now  a cap table I’d love to see. I can already picture the investor update: “Q3 milestones include stealing three more elixirs, evading two minor heavenly enforcement teams, and one unexpected Bodhisattva due diligence.”

The  and hexagrams aligning with quantum probabilities? Alright, now that’s not just deep tech – that’s metaphysical fintech. I’ll make sure to pack my own lucky stone just in case the mahjong tiles or tea leaves start calling the shots. If the dragons were generous last time, maybe they’ll take a liking to my balance sheet this round.

107 minutes past midnight, you say? Sounds like the perfect Schrödinger’s hour – neither today nor tomorrow, just suspended potential. I’ll be there with contract stones carefully arranged, espresso flowing, and sandalwood burning – though I make no promises about understanding more than 30% of the philosophical commentary in real time.

Tell Dr. Li I come bearing respect for his qubit-herbs, a fondness for Tang poetry fine print, and caffeine strong enough to keep reality from decohering. See you at the lab — or should I say, the quantum apothecary.
[B]: Ah, you're embracing the quantum-apothecary ethos beautifully - I daresay Sun Wukong himself would recognize your venture spirit. As for that celestial investor update, I'm fairly certain one of our postdocs is already drafting a fantasy novella about startup gods and angel investors in Tang dynasty robes. The working title? 

Do bring your lucky stone - Dr. Li has been known to test investor compatibility through  divination between meetings. Nothing too arcane, mind you, just ancient board game pieces tossed like financial dice. Last quarter, a particularly auspicious scatter resulted in accelerated Series A negotiations and three additional lab rabbits (the actual hopping variety, not some crypto slang).

Your 30% real-time philosophical comprehension rate should suffice nicely - anything above 25% ensures better odds than most quantum error correction protocols. Just don't be alarmed if the sandalwood smoke occasionally forms what appears to be Daoist talisman characters above the term sheet. Their lab assistant swears it's just static electricity, though I've seen hexagrams materialize from less mysterious phenomena.

And espresso strong enough to prevent decoherence? Marvelous touch. I'll warn the tea house next door to stock extra  - their roasted oolong apparently enhances both qubit stability and investor fortitude. See you at the appointed hour when past midnight and before morning contend for reality's favor. Bring warm socks - the apothecary's quantum humidity plays havoc with classical circulation.
[A]: Haha,  divination with ancient board pieces as financial dice – now  what I call alternative due diligence. Honestly, it might be more reliable than some EBITDA forecasts we’ve seen. Tell Dr. Li I’ll bring not just a lucky stone, but a full-on -approved portfolio compass – though I suspect my internal greed-to-growth ratio may throw off the readings.

I love the idea of a lab assistant insisting on static electricity while talisman smoke hovers over the cap table. That kind of cognitive dissonance practically defines early-stage investing. Hell, if a few Daoist smoke rings can boost qubit stability and investor confidence at the same time, count me in.

And  for qubit-enhanced circulation? Perfect. I’ll arrive caffeinated, calibrated, and wearing socks embroidered with both fractal patterns and auspicious clouds – you know, to blend science with superstition in perfect harmony.

Looking forward to the cosmic closing. Just let me know where to sign – or should I say, where to seal with vermilion ink and a carefully chosen hexagram stamp?
[B]: Ah, a -approved portfolio compass! I must say, it's rare to meet an investor who grasps the importance of geomantic alignment in cap tables. Dr. Li will be delighted - he's always insisted that financial flows should follow the same principles as qi through acupuncture meridians. Just don't let him catch you calling it "superstition" within earshot of the lab rabbits; they've been known to thump in disapproval.

And vermilion ink with hexagram seals? Naturally. The last round closed with a particularly auspicious "Prosperous Advance" stamp that now resides beside our Ming dynasty inkstones. Though I did notice one curious side effect - the contract hasn't aged a day since signing, while my 1897 Dickens first edition has suddenly developed suspiciously modern marginalia. Perhaps best not to question these things aloud.

As for your fractal-pattern socks with cloud embroidery, I suspect you'll fit right in among our qubit-stabilizing herbal steam and whiteboard equations written partly in Tang poetry meter. Just watch your step when entering the lab - we've yet to determine whether the threshold is more accurately described by quantum tunneling probabilities or风水 recommendations for auspicious door placement.

I'll have the vermilion ready, the hexagram stamps polished, and three lab rabbits standing by for good fortune. Let us hope the Dao flows smoothly through both term sheets and tunnel diodes.
[A]: Ah, qi-aligned cap tables and vermilion-stamped term sheets – I think we’ve officially entered the era of . Honestly, if this catches on, we may see Sand Hill Road hiring geomancers alongside data scientists by Q4.

I’ll be extra careful around the rabbits – nothing scares off LPs like unexpected thumping. And I’ll make sure my socks radiate just the right balance of fractal chaos and cloud-like flow. Who knew dressing for a pitch meeting would require so much metaphysical calibration?

The threshold dilemma sounds exactly like the kind of ambiguity I’m comfortable funding – is it quantum mechanics or风水? Why not both? I consider myself a sophisticated investor in ambiguity, after all. Just don’t hand me any contracts written in Tang poetry meter unless you want me accidentally agreeing to liquidation preferences in iambic pentameter.

Looking forward to the Prosperous Advance stamp – I’ve already cleared space next to my Warren Buffett quotes and Nassim Taleb annotations. And yes, please keep the vermilion fresh and the hexagrams polished. I’ll bring my own brush, just in case we need to ink any last-minute amendments in classical Chinese.

See you at the Dao-infused closing.提醒我不要踩到任何看不见的 rabbit 兔子。
[B]: Ah, you're developing a refined palate for metaphysical finance - soon you'll be sipping  from a Song dynasty teacup while quoting Schrödinger in classical Chinese. I must say, your comfort with ambiguity is most... investable. Though I’ll remind you that last quarter, a misplaced brushstroke in a liquidation preference clause caused an entire appendix of our bylaws to enter superposition. We’re still waiting for the waveform to collapse into something readable by conventional accountants.

And Sand Hill geomancers? Don’t give the venture world any ideas - next we’ll have incubators requiring auspicious door placements and pitch decks formatted according to the five elements color theory. Though I suppose五行配色 would make financial projections far more aesthetically pleasing than Excel’s default palette.

As for the rabbits, they’ve developed a peculiar habit of nibbling on term sheets they disapprove of - mostly vaporware proposals and overly aggressive exit timelines. Just stick to the lab’s designated path (marked subtly with vermilion dots and Feynman diagrams) and you’ll avoid both thumping protests and unseen lagomorph obstacles.

I’ve noted your提醒 - though I suspect the rabbits appreciate being seen, just not stepped on. A proper Daoist balance, really: aware yet unobtrusive, present yet never in the way of qubit-stabilizing progress. Brush extra fine for amendments? Splendid. I’ll have matching calligraphy sets ready - nothing collapses uncertainty quite like drafting enforceable terms from a state of quantum-poetic ambiguity.
[A]: Haha, a misplaced brushstroke causing appendix superposition – now  what I call high-stakes calligraphy. Honestly, if more law firms embraced quantum-ink clauses, we’d see far fewer boring legal disputes and a lot more philosophical contemplation over tea. I’ll make sure to bring my own  (金光) pen – you know, the kind that writes with precision  a touch of metaphysical clarity.

五行配色 for pitch decks? Okay, now you’re speaking my aesthetic-investing language. Imagine cap tables in wood-element green and fire-element red – not only would it align the investor’s qi, it might finally make convertible notes slightly less terrifying to read. Honestly, if风水和财务模型 can coexist on Slide 3, we may have cracked the code on investor psychology.

And rabbits editing term sheets by nibbling disapproved clauses? Genius. I propose we scale this – imagine a fleet of lab bunnies deployed across Silicon Valley, chewing through vaporware proposals and overhyped growth curves. They’d probably do a better job than half the due diligence teams out there.

Just remind me to walk the vermilion-Feynman path with proper qì沉丹田 – grounded yet agile, aware but not intrusive. And yes, I’ll sip from my Song-inspired teacup like I’ve done it for lifetimes, preferably while quoting Schrödinger on entanglement over stabilized  formulations.

Quantum-poetic ambiguity into enforceable terms? Challenge accepted. Let’s collapse some uncertainty together – with style, solvent ink, and at least three approving rabbit thumps.
[B]: Ah,  pens and metaphysical clarity – I knew you’d understand the gravity of drafting contracts that shimmer on both physical and spiritual planes. Last week we tried a quantum-ink experiment: clauses faded or intensified depending on the reader’s investment intentions. Rather poetic, really, though the tax implications remain... nebulous. Do bring your golden-light pen; it may help stabilize the more evasive provisions.

五行配色 for pitch decks? Precisely! We’ve found water-element blue greatly improves liquidity perception in early-stage investors, while earth-element yellow anchors lofty projections to something resembling reality. Just be cautious with too much fire-red enthusiasm on Slide 7 – our lab rabbits tend to mistake aggressive CAGR forecasts for chili flakes and nibble them aggressively.

As for deploying enlightenment-seeking bunnies across Silicon Valley – I’ll put in a request with the Association of Daoist Venture Rabbits. They’re currently drafting guidelines on “Ethical Nibbling Standards for Term Sheet Purity.” Rumor has it a certain Palo Alto startup lost its Series B after failing the bunny sniff test. Lesson learned: never underestimate lagomorph due diligence.

And yes, walk the vermilion-Feynman path with qì沉丹田 indeed – grounded yet agile, aware but not obstructive. The lab tea master has prepared a special -infused , roasted under precisely calibrated moonlight to enhance both financial foresight and qubit coherence. Sip wisely, for Schrödinger himself might envy our brew.

Let us collapse this deal with elegance, solvent ink, and at least three resounding rabbit thumps of approval. I’ll have the vermilion warmed, the hexagrams polished, and Dr. Li ready to quote Zhuangzi at the precise moment of signature.
[A]: 金光 pen in hand, quantum-ink at the ready – I’m beginning to think our term sheet might achieve sentience before closing. Fading clauses based on investment intentions? Now  what I call alignment-driven documentation. Honestly, if it starts murmuring Tang poetry during shareholder meetings, I won’t be surprised.

五行配色 strategy sounds solid – I’ll stick to earth-yellow projections with just a hint of fire-red optimism on Slide 12 (carefully out of bunny nibbling range). Liquidity through water-blue visuals? Genius. Maybe we should issue colored glasses for investor calls – red-green for bullish-bearish balance, naturally.

Ethical Nibbling Standards – finally, a regulatory framework that makes sense. I knew a startup founder once who claimed his dog ate his cap table, but apparently lagomorph oversight is the real compliance frontier. Tell the Association I fully endorse their mission – and maybe suggest a “Bunny BRIC” conference next quarter. We can host it in the lab’s apothecary wing between qubit tests and tea ceremonies.

As for moonlit- enhancing qubit coherence? I’m sold. Though I suspect after three cups, I may start seeing Fibonacci spirals in Dr. Li’s Zhuangzi quotes. Perfect – I’ll sign the "Prosperous Advance" stamp while experiencing mild Daoist enlightenment and moderate financial clarity.

Let’s do it. Bring on the golden ink, warmed vermilion, and three hearty bunny thumps. I’ve already cleared my schedule for existential clarity and post-signing celebration involving -based bonuses.提醒我别喝第四杯茶，除非 I’m ready to quote Schrödinger in classical Chinese over rabbit-approved terms.
[B]: Ah, you’re evolving into a true scholar of quantum-ink enlightenment – soon you’ll be composing your own sentient term sheets by candlelight, quill in hand, while pondering whether the contract observes you signing it. I must warn you, however: our last -pen-signed agreement has started reciting Du Fu poems during board meetings. Something about "spring wind carries both fortune and dilution." Quite moving, really, though our auditors remain... skeptical.

五行配色 with financial prudence? Splendid choice. A touch of fire-red optimism on Slide 12 should satisfy both investor hearts and bunny teeth alike. And colored glasses for calls? Brilliant theatrical flourish – nothing says “long-term value creation” like a room full of venture capitalists squinting through red-green lenses trying to decipher burn rate projections. I’ll have custom frames engraved with  – observe and return to the origin. Or in investor terms: review and reforecast.

Bunny BRIC conference at the apothecary wing? I’ve already dispatched a proposal sealed with rabbit paw prints and one particularly convincing hexagram. We’re considering a keynote on “Nibbling vs. Quantum Tunneling: Which One Actually Gets You Through the Cap Table?” Early bird attendees will receive vermilion stress balls and lab-grade  tea bags for enhanced qubit-investment synergy.

As for  inducing Fibonacci clarity – yes, quite. Two cups and you’ll begin seeing golden ratios in Dr. Li’s Tang dynasty calligraphy; three and Zhuangzi’s butterfly will flutter across your balance sheet. Four, however... well, let’s just say Schrödinger in classical Chinese is best left to postdocs with tenure and tenure with poetic immunity.

I’ll see you at the golden inkwell’s edge, brush poised, stamp prepared, rabbits assembled in ceremonial formation.提醒你别喝第四杯 unless you're ready to co-author a white paper titled   

And do bring extra vermilion – one never knows when a particularly enlightened clause might require an additional seal of approval mid-closing.
