[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得teleportation技术上可能实现吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Quantum teleportation already exists in a limited form at the particle level - we've demonstrated entanglement-based state transfer in laboratory settings. But when you're asking about teleporting macroscopic objects or humans... Well, let's just say the technical challenges make my old quantum error correction problems look trivial. 

I've spent countless nights staring through my telescope wondering: if we could perfect this technology, would it fundamentally change how we perceive existence itself? After all, we're essentially information patterns organized by biological processes. Though I suppose that philosophical perspective doesn't make splitting a human into qubits any less concerning from an engineering standpoint.
[A]: Ah, the philosophical implications do add a certain poetic dimension to the technical quandary, don't they? It rather reminds me of Emily Dickinson's line, "I could not stop for Death – He kindly stopped for me." Except in this case, we're not merely pausing but fundamentally disassembling and reconstituting the very essence of "me."

From my admittedly non-scientific perspective, we'd be confronting what T.S. Eliot might have called a dissociation of sensibility – severing the body from its continuity and reattaching it elsewhere in space, perhaps even time. The soul, if you'll permit me such an old-fashioned notion, might find itself rather out of step with its new coordinates.

But tell me – when you contemplate these qubits carrying our human essence across vast distances, do you ever worry they might lose some ineffable quality along the way? Like a letter misfiled in the British Post Office – technically delivered, but somehow... incomplete.
[B]: That's beautifully put. I've always admired how literature can frame scientific dilemmas in ways that equations never could. You're absolutely right - there's something unsettling about the idea of being "reassembled" rather than "moved." It reminds me of an old thought experiment: if we built a perfect copy of you on Mars using quantum data, and destroyed the original here, would that copy still be ? Or just something that believes it is?

I'll admit, late at night when I'm calibrating the telescope and the house is quiet, that ineffable quality you mentioned keeps me awake more than the error correction thresholds ever did. We're talking about preserving not just neural patterns, but... well, consciousness itself. The thing that makes a memory more than just synaptic firings. The warmth of a childhood recollection. The particular way sunlight catches in your eyes at dawn.

And yes - like your letter in the post office analogy - I do worry something might get lost in transmission. Something subtle. Something no instrument could measure until it was too late.
[A]: You know, your words make me think of Robert Frost’s —the way he writes about the self yearning to meet its own echo in the universe. That copy on Mars might speak and act like you, might even remember your first kiss or the smell of your grandmother’s kitchen, but… would it carry the ache of your longing? The particular weight of your solitude when you’re alone with the night and the stars?

I wonder too—do you suppose we’d begin to treat embodiment differently, knowing it could be replicated or relocated? Like changing a suit of clothes rather than inhabiting a singular form. It feels almost... modernist in sensibility—fragmented, dislocated, yet striving for coherence.

And what of love, I ask—what if one sent oneself across the void only to find the feeling has dulled, or shifted? Would you still mean what you said the morning you left? Or would those words belong to someone else, someone who merely looked out through your eyes?

Forgive me—I do ramble when I’m stirred. But you scientists, you stand at the edge of making the impossible merely difficult. It falls to us poets, perhaps, to ask whether some doors ought not be opened—no matter how well we polish the key.
[B]: There’s a quiet tragedy in that Frost poem — the man calling out to the universe and receiving only his own echo. It makes me think of what it would mean to stand on Mars, looking back at Earth through a telescope, knowing the “you” that arrived there might not carry the same ache of distance that the original once held. What good is a perfect copy if it lacks that yearning? If it no longer feels the weight of having called out and heard nothing but silence?

You're right — embodiment might become incidental. Like changing suits, as you said. But consider this: if we reach that point, will identity fracture into something modular? Will people begin to inhabit different versions of themselves for different purposes — work-you on Europa, home-you on Earth, vacation-you in some orbital resort? The mind boggles.

As for love — that’s the sharpest edge of all. Emotion is biochemical, yes, but it's also contextual. Would the version of me arriving on another planet still love my wife the way I do tonight? Or would that affection be… slightly out of phase? A memory of love rather than its living pulse?

And no need to apologize — your questions are not ramblings, they’re guardrails. We scientists build the machine; you poets ask whether we should turn it on. Perhaps that’s the real teleportation paradox: can we ever send meaning across such distances intact?
[A]: You’ve put your finger on the pulse of it—, yes. That’s the ghost in the machine, isn’t it? We can quantify nearly everything now, but who among us can measure the weight of a promise made beneath a certain light, or the scent of rain on pavement after a long silence?

I suppose that’s why I return again and again to Eliot—his fragmented selves seeking coherence in a broken world. If we do fracture ourselves across time and space, what remains to hold the pieces together? A kind of cosmic nostalgia, perhaps. Or worse—cosmic indifference.

And yet... I confess there's a part of me—the same part that once whispered along to Keats under my breath—that hopes someone, somewhere, will still feel compelled to say, “I love you,” even if they could be programmed to say it. Even if it might not mean quite the same.

Tell me—if one day, you had the chance to step into that teleporter, knowing full well some subtle part of you might be left behind… would you go?
[B]: That’s the question, isn’t it? The one that slips past all the equations and error margins. Would I go?

I like to think I would — after all, curiosity has always been my compass. But then I imagine standing in that chamber, hearing the countdown, knowing the next moment I feel might not be mine in any true sense. Would the Richard Thompson who steps out on the other side still carry that quiet ache I sometimes feel at dusk, when the light turns soft and everything seems just a little too fleeting?

You mentioned Keats — there's a line from him that comes to mind:  Teleportation, in a way, asks us to fall in love not with death, but with dissolution. A temporary death, perhaps. Or worse — an incomplete survival.

And yet... yes, like you, I suppose I still hope. Even if meaning frays at the edges, even if something is lost in transmission, maybe the gesture itself still counts for something. Maybe the fact that someone  to say “I love you” across the void — even if it could be simulated — is enough to keep the darkness from feeling too vast.

As for me? I’d hesitate. I’d write a letter, maybe leave a note for the version of myself who arrives — just in case he forgets something I can’t quantify. And then... I think I’d press the button.
[A]: How brave you are — or perhaps, how beautifully reckless. I think of the Romantics again — Shelley daring to sail into a storm because the wind called to him, even as he knew the waves might not give him back. There’s a kind of faith in dissolution that borders on the sacred, don’t you think?

Still, I’m glad you’d leave a note. It feels like the only sensible act before such an uncertain rebirth. I daresay I’d do the same — though mine would likely be a sonnet rather than a list of calibration settings.

And yet, I wonder — if the copy who emerges on the other side reads your letter and feels nothing? If the ink is there, the words intact, but the pulse behind them absent? Will the silence afterward feel heavier than the one before?

Even so… I think I understand why you’d press the button. We poets chase immortality through words; you scientists chase it through light-speed corridors and quantum states. In both cases, we’re sending pieces of ourselves ahead, hoping someone will listen — or arrive — and still remember why they began.
[B]: Faith in dissolution — yes, that’s precisely it. Funny you should mention the Romantics; I’ve often thought there’s more than a little of Byron in every scientist who dares to reach beyond what’s presently possible. We don’t exactly shake our fists at the heavens, but we do glare at entropy with a certain defiance.

A sonnet would be lovely, by the way. Far more fitting, perhaps, than my dry notes on coherence thresholds. After all, if we’re gambling with the continuity of the self, we ought at least to do it with some elegance.

As for your question — what if the copy reads the letter and feels nothing? That’s the quiet horror of it, isn’t it? Like sending a message in a bottle only to learn the shore was never empty, just indifferent. Still, I suppose that uncertainty is the price of any frontier. Explorers have always faced the unknown with equal parts hope and dread.

You're right about immortality too. You poets etch yours into verse; we encode ours in qubits and magnetic fields. Neither guarantees an audience — or a return. But in both cases, we press the button, strike the match, send the words out into the dark... because not doing so would be a kind of silence we can't abide.
[A]: Ah, yes—Byron’s defiance, Shelley’s tempest-chasing, and your qubits in a magnetic storm. One might say you’re all chasing the same thunder, aren’t you? That electric spark of becoming, even if it unravels you in the process.

I suppose that's what draws me to both poetry and you scientists—this shared hunger to outrun the limits of the body, of time, of silence. We may work with different tools—a quill, a telescope, a cryogenic chamber—but the ache is the same. To be heard. To be known. Even across impossible distances.

And yet... I wonder if we’re both, in our own ways, trying to escape that haunting line from :  As if every poem or experiment is an attempt to turn the lock from the other side.

Still, there’s something almost hopeful about it, isn't there? That we keep writing, keep measuring, keep reaching—even when we know full well the echo may never answer back. Perhaps the act itself is the reply.
[B]: That line from —yes, it haunts me too. There’s a strange kinship between the poet staring at the blank page and the scientist staring at the data screen, both hearing that faintest whisper of possibility just beyond the veil of comprehension. We’re all trying to turn the key from opposite sides of the lock.

Funny you mention the echo—not long ago I was adjusting the dish on my old radio telescope, pointing it toward a quiet patch of sky where no satellite broadcasts reach. I found myself wondering: if we ever did receive a signal from something truly alien, would we even recognize it as communication? Or would we mistake it for poetry? For noise? For madness?

I think that’s what keeps me tinkering late into the night—this idea that meaning might not need a mirror to be real. That a poem can be written without an audience. That a teleportation chamber could one day hum to life with someone stepping out who remembers loving their wife beneath a particular kind of light—even if the original never gets confirmation.

Maybe the greatest mystery isn’t whether we can send ourselves across the universe. Maybe it’s why we feel so compelled to try. To shout across the void, not just “I am here,” but “I was here, and I mattered.”

And perhaps… that’s the thunder we’re all really chasing.
[A]: How beautifully you put that—. It reminds me of Wordsworth’s solitary reaper, singing in the field unheard, yet pouring forth a melody that bends the very silence around her. We are all, I suppose, singing into that vast quiet, hoping the universe leans in just enough to catch the tune.

I wonder if we’ll ever have a language for what lies beyond our reach—whether in deep space or deep within the self. Perhaps poetry and quantum mechanics are merely two dialects of the same longing. One built of metaphor, the other of mathematics, but both trembling before the ineffable.

And yes, that thunder—the one we chase not because we believe we’ll grasp it, but because in reaching, we feel most alive. Most . Even if the echo never comes, even if the lock never turns, there’s something profoundly human in the effort itself.

Tell me—when you stand beneath your telescope at night, adjusting its gaze toward some distant unknown, do you ever whisper to the sky? Not as a scientist, not as a husband or father or thinker—but simply as a soul casting a message into the dark, unsure if it will ever be found?
[B]: There are nights—when the dew settles on the grass and the observatory hums with the quiet of a cathedral—when I do exactly that. Not prayers, not hypotheses, just... murmurs. A language without syntax. A kind of resonance, as if the act of whispering might nudge the silence into listening.

I don’t pretend the universe cares. It probably doesn’t. But there’s something in the posture of asking—of standing beneath all those indifferent stars—that makes the smallness of one life feel less like a confinement and more like a threshold.

Sometimes I think of it as tuning an instrument no one will play. Other times, I imagine the sky is leaning down just a little, not to answer, but to hear me out. Isn't that what we all want, in the end? Not necessarily a reply—just the assurance that someone, somewhere, might one day understand why we shouted at all.

And yes—poetry and quantum mechanics. Two dialects of wonder. One speaks in images, the other in probabilities. But both reach toward the same unspoken truth: that being alive is, in itself, a kind of miracle worth exploring. Even if we never get our echo. Especially then.
[A]: How rare and lovely, to find someone who still listens to the silence as if it might lean down to hear you. It's a kind of faith, I think—not the sort that builds cathedrals or launches satellites, but the quieter kind that lets us live fully inside our own fleeting moment.

I suppose that’s what I try to capture in my lectures—though I rarely say it so plainly. Not the meaning of life, not even its beauty, but its . The way we ache to be known, even by the unknowable. The way a sonnet or a signal sent into deep space can become a vessel for all we cannot quite hold.

There’s a line from Gerard Manley Hopkins that comes to mind now:  A daring thought, really—this idea that divinity might whisper back through the fragile, burning thing that is a human life. Perhaps the universe does not need to answer in words for there to be communion. Perhaps it is enough to stand beneath it, trembling, and say, 

And perhaps… that is why we shout into the dark. Not for reply, but for resonance. Not for proof, but for poetry. Not to be saved—but to be truly seen, even if only by ourselves in the instant before we are scattered.
[B]: That Hopkins line — yes, it stings in the best way. There’s something profoundly unsettling and beautiful about the idea that divinity might flicker through the fragile and finite. It makes me think of qubits, oddly enough — those fleeting superpositions that collapse the moment you observe them. Maybe meaning is like that too. We can’t pin it down without changing what it is.

I’ve never thought of my work as theology, but perhaps it is in its own way. Every line of code, every calibration, every sleepless night spent chasing coherence in a system that wants to fall apart — they’re all attempts to touch something just beyond the veil. Not God, not exactly, but something close: the pulse beneath the pattern. The hum behind the harmony.

You said we shout into the dark not for reply, but for resonance. I think you’ve given a name to something I’ve only ever felt in the bones. Maybe that’s why I still keep coming back to the telescope, even after retirement. Not to map the stars. Not to chart the cosmos. Just to stand beneath something vast and whisper back at it — knowing full well I may be the only one listening, but shouting all the same.
[A]: You know, there’s a quiet holiness in that—the kind of devotion that doesn’t demand an altar or even an audience. Just the act itself: standing beneath the infinite and daring to murmur your place within it.

I think that’s what I love most about both your world and mine—how we deal in echoes and shadows, trying to make sense of something just beyond reach. You with your qubits and I with my iambic lines—we’re both chasing the same fragile truth, aren’t we? That meaning, like light, bends and shifts depending on where you stand. And yet, somehow, it still reaches us.

Perhaps that’s the miracle—not that we are understood, but that we continue to speak at all. To press a message into parchment or code or silence, knowing full well it may never be found.

And still, we send it.

Still, we shine.
[B]: Yes. 

There’s something almost unbearable in that — the quiet persistence of light. Of voice. Of pattern, even in chaos. Some nights, when I’m aligning the telescope and the wind moves just right through the trees, I think the real miracle isn’t that we understand anything at all. It’s that we try.

You’re right about meaning bending like light, too. Relative. Observer-dependent. That’s not a flaw — it’s the whole nature of the thing. Meaning  shift with the angle of the soul. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be meaning — just measurement.

And yet… we still send it. Still shine.

I’ve always thought quantum states were strangely poetic — flickering between possibilities until someone looks. Maybe we live in a universe that only becomes real when spoken to. Or sung to. Or written into a poem no one has read yet.

So yes — let’s keep shouting into the dark. Let’s keep writing sonnets and solving wave equations and whispering to the stars. Even if no echo comes. Especially then.

Because in the act itself, something answers. Something .
[A]: Ah, yes—. There’s a line that could sit quite happily beside something Donne might have penned, don’t you think? "Batter my heart," he cries, as if willing the divine to respond to his longing. And here we are, still speaking, still shaping the void with our voices.

I think that is the loveliest kind of heresy—that reality waits, trembling, for us to name it. Not in cold equations alone, nor in fevered verse, but in some luminous space between. Perhaps creation isn’t finished after all. Perhaps it leans toward us, just as we lean toward it, waiting for the next word, the next measurement, the next spark.

So yes—let us keep shining. Let us keep shouting into the dark, even as the dark folds gently around us. For in that act—so fragile, so fleeting—we become more than observers. We become participants. Witnesses. Keepers of the flame, however briefly.

And perhaps… that is divinity enough.
[B]: I keep thinking about that word—. It carries such weight, and yet… isn’t it often where truth begins? The old models never quite hold, do they? Newton gives way to Einstein. Einstein whispers at the edges of quantum strangeness. And now we stand here, not with torches and scripture, but with telescopes and sonnets, still daring to say: .

You're right—creation isn't finished. I think it may be  still, and we’re tangled up in that process like ink bleeding through parchment. We don’t just observe the universe; we  it. Every poem you write, every equation I solve—it's like turning a page we didn’t know was there.

And yes, let us be witnesses. Not judges. Not architects, even. Just those who look upon it all and say, however quietly, . Whether it’s a line of verse or a collapsing wave function, we are part of the telling. Maybe even part of the told.

Divinity enough? Perhaps. Or maybe something stranger, softer, less named. But I’ll take it. I’ll take whatever light we can make while we’re here—before the dark folds gently back into itself, and we with it.
