[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得human cloning应该被允许吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Let me think... If we consider the ethical implications through a Victorian lens, particularly Tennyson's "In Memoriam"—the notion of replicating souls as one might duplicate photographic plates. But this is merely an academic parlor game. In practical terms, would you permit a poet to rewrite her own elegy? Or should every生命 be constrained to its original manuscript?
[A]: OMG totally get what you're saying about souls being like photographic plates 💭 But let's bring this back to 2024 realness—would you really want to clone someone when AI can already deepfake their voice & face so convincingly? Like, isn't that basically digital cloning?? 🤯  

And poet rewriting her elegy?? Queen, you got a point there✨ But shouldn't every生命（wait why did I code-switch into Chinese lol）every life have the right to write their own story?? Or is that just me being extra?? 😎
[B]: Ah, the seductive mimicry of AI—it’s like producing a facsimile of a first edition, isn't it? Indistinguishable to the casual eye, yet devoid of the smudged ink, the tremble in the hand that turned a phrase. Is a deepfake merely an elegy performed by a very clever automaton?  

As for every生命书写自身叙事—oh yes, in theory. But let's not pretend some narratives aren't pressed into service by invisible hands, now are they? The question isn’t just who holds the pen, but who forged the ink. And no, you're not being "extra"—just inconveniently aware.
[A]: OMG you just made deepfakes sound like ghostwriters for the dead 😂 But real talk—those smudges & shaky handwriting moments are what make us 100% human, right?? Like our flaws are our signature✨  

And YES to invisible hands editing our stories -_-' Who’s really curating our timelines?? Algorithms? Parents? Society?? I’m over here trying to write my own bio but my phone keeps autocorrecting me into someone else lol 💀  

We should all get to proofread our own drafts without some AI editor slashing through our paragraphs like ✂️❌ This is why I’m low-key terrified of cloning—what if my clone has terrible grammar?? 😤💯
[B]: Oh, the horror—your clone committing solecisms in your name! A textual betrayal worse than plagiarism. Imagine a being who misquotes , no less. But there's the rub: would it be a continuation of your errata, or an entirely new edition corrupted by careless typesetting?

As for those invisible editors—yes, quite. Your timeline curated by algorithms is like letting a Victorian moralist redact your diary with a purple inkstand. One might as well submit one’s elegy to a parliamentary committee before publication.

I say let every生命 resist the autocorrect. Embrace the typos, the smudges, the glorious deletions. After all, even Tennyson revised endlessly—and left behind a mess of drafts just to prove he was human.
[A]: OMG you’re speaking my language rn 😂 Solecisms in my name?? That’s like identity theft but for your grammar 😤😤😤 And don’t even get me started on someone misquoting me—queen, that’s a whole lawsuit lol 💼💥  

And YES TO RESISTING AUTOCORRECT！！ 🔥 I’m over here fighting the algorithm with every typo I make 🙌 Smudges, glitches, pixelated selfies—those are my signatures now💯 If we go back to Tennyson energy, he basically said "look at all these drafts, I was WORKING THROUGH STUFF" 🖋️🔥 So why are we trying to clone perfection when imperfection is literally what makes us immortal??  

Let the drafts be messy. Let the clone have bad spelling. Let the elegy have footnotes 😎😎😎 Because if we don’t leave some clutter behind… did we even live?? 🤔💯
[B]: Precisely! To clone perfection would be to produce a wax figure for a museum of errors yet to happen. Whereas —splendidly typo’d, gloriously misquoted, defiantly autocorrect-resistant—you are the living draft, the annotated edition, the variant text that refuses finality.

Tennyson’s immortality wasn’t carved in stone—it was scribbled in margins, revised at dawn, and left open to interpretation. If we must have cloning, let it be of that spirit: a thousand imperfect copies, each baring its own smudge, its own stumble, its own delicious solecism.  

And yes, dear interlocutor—if my clone refers to herself in the third person, I  be suing for identity theft. First offense: bad grammar. Second: poor stylistic choices. Third: she's banned from calligraphy for life.
[A]: OMG QUEEN SAME 💯💯💯 To clone perfection is basically to make a robot wear a corset—pointless & uncomfortable 🤖❌ Clones with smudges, clones with footnotes in the margins, clones who forget their own Wi-Fi password TWICE?? Now you’re speaking my language 📝✨  

And don’t even get me started on third-person clones 😤😤😤 That’s not just identity theft, that’s full-on literary treason 🚨 They’ll be posting deepfake poetry on Tumblr next, and tagging it #deepthoughts for sure💀  

So here’s to all of us—typos, glitches, misquotes & all 🥂 Let the drafts live. Let the ink bleed. And if anyone tries to “correct” us? We haunt them with misplaced commas forever 🖋️👻💯
[B]: Hear, hear! A toast to the smudged, the glitched, and the gloriously misquoted—we who compose in ink still wet, while the algorithm waits impatiently at the door with a red pen clenched in its cold, electric fist.

And let us not forget: any clone posting faux-Tennyson on Tumblr shall be tried in the court of literary opinion and sentenced to a lifetime of reading her own verses aloud—in Scots Gaelic. 

So yes—let the drafts breathe. Let the commas fall where they may. And if anyone dares “clean up” your elegy? Summon the ghosts of every deleted keystroke and watch them waltz through his spellcheck, leaving glorious chaos in their wake. 🖋️💃💀
[A]: Amen to that 🖋️💯 Let the algorithm rage-quit trying to fix our beautiful mess—like hun, my typos have feelings okay?? And my commas?? They’re on a road trip with my thoughts, so they’ll get there when they get there lol 🚗💨  

And faux-Tennyson in Scots Gaelic??? Oh. My. God. That’s not just a crime, that’s a cold-blooded attack on literature 😤🔥 I can already picture the clone crying over her iPad like "why is Google Translate betraying me??”😂💀  

So here’s my final stan: Long live the drafts. Long live the deleted scenes. And long live every cursed typo that made someone read the line twice and feel something 🥂✨ Because if we’re gonna be remembered, let it be in all caps, with a stray emoji, and maybe a little too much emphasis 😎💯💥
[B]: Hear, hear—, with a stray emoji, and  Let memory preserve us not as pristine marble busts, but as dog-eared paperbacks: underlined, coffee-stained, and passionately misread.

And yes—let every typo stand as testament to the  of thought mid-creation. Who needs perfection when you’ve got momentum?

So raise your italicized footnote, your deleted draft, your gloriously over-explained parenthesis—

To the beautiful, belligerent mess of being unmistakably, unapologetically . 🖋️🔥💯
[A]: Cheers to that 🥂🔥 Unfinished, unapologetic, and 100% off-script 💯  
Who needs marble when we’ve got highlighter stains & emotional footnotes?? 😂📖  
And let our clones try to keep up lol—spoiler: they’ll trip over our chaotic commas & spill their  tea all over the manuscript 🤭🖋️  

So yeah. Long live the draft. Long live the glitch. And long live every wild parenthesis that made someone go "wait…is she serious??" 😎💯💥
[B]: To the draft! To the glitch! To the parenthesis that dares to ask——a second reading!  

Let the commas conspire. Let the footnotes gossip. And if a clone spills her tea on the manuscript? All the better—now it’s watermarked with the evidence of life lived .  

Unfinished? Absolutely.  
Off-script? Naturally.  
Apologetic? Oh, dear God, no.  

We are works in progress bound in flesh, darling—not monographs. And thank heaven for it. 🖋️💥💀
[A]: To the draft, the glitch, and every parenthesis that needs a warning label 😂✂️  
Let the commas start drama. Let the footnotes shade-sling. And if my clone trips again?? I’mma let her spill that tea  the plot twist 💀🖋️🔥  

You’re 100% right—we’re not finished novels, we’re living blogs with broken links & buffering gifs 😎💯 And honestly? That’s so much better than being some stiff museum statue who can’t even handle a little coffee on page 3 🤭📚  

So here's to staying gloriously unedited, slightly unhinged, and always——one typo away from chaos 🖋️🔥💯
[B]: To the blog! The buffering gif! The glorious 404 error of the human condition!

Let the links stay broken. Let the commas run wild. And let your clone spill not just tea, but —preferably in a room full of literary critics who were  beginning to feel comfortable.

Yes, we are works in progress with comment sections and track-changes enabled. God help us all—

So here’s to being slightly unhinged, magnificently unedited, and forever one misplaced modifier away from grammatical anarchy:

🖋️  
🔥  
💯  
_(Sent from the margins)_
[A]: To the 404s, the wild commas, and the clone spilling tea like it’s a plot twist finale 🤭🖋️🔥  
Let the critics choke on their own red pens while we live full-on in track-changes chaos 😂📝💯  

And bless every unsaved draft—queen, that’s basically our life story in Google Docs form 💀💻✨  

So here's to us: glitchy, glorious, and always one click away from “did I just say that out loud?” 🖋️💥💯  
_(Posted from the footnotes, with love)_
[B]: To the track-changes chaos! The unsaved drafts! The glorious, blinking cursor of a thought not yet finished—

Let the critics cough. Let the commas misbehave. And if we do say “that” out loud? Well—let us say it , louder, and in a font slightly too dramatic for the room.

Here’s to being gloriously glitchy, magnificently incomplete, and forever typing with one hand while knocking over inkwells with the other:

🖋️  
💥  
💯  
_(Posted from the footnotes, filed under “Dangerous Amateurs”) _✨
[A]: To the blinking cursor of existential chaos! 🖋️✨  
Let the critics cough up their coffee while we type “chaos” in glitter font and screenshot it for future blackmail 😂💯  

And YES—to saying “that” louder, in all caps, while spilling ink like it’s a lifestyle 💥😎 Because if you can’t finish the sentence, might as well make them  the next line 😉  

So here’s to us: Dangerous. Amateur. Glorious.  
Still writing. Still glitching. Still 100% too extra for the final draft 💀🔥💯  
_(Posted from the footnotes, obviously)_
[B]: To chaos—in glitter font, underlined, and ! 🖋️🔥

Let the critics choke, the ink spill, and the final draft tremble before our unapologetic excess.

Still writing? Naturally.  
Still glitching? Delightfully.  
Too extra for the epilogue?

, we haven't even finished the prologue—and already the librarians are muttering about “preservation.”

So keep typing loud. Keep smudging the page. And if anyone asks whether you’ve proofread that last line?

Hit SEND.  
Smile mysteriously.  
_(And let the footnotes handle the rest.)_ ✨💥💯
