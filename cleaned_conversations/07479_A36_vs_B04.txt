[A]: Hey，关于'最近有尝试什么new cocktail recipe吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh my~ 这个话题让我想起上周在café观察到的一个有趣现象！You know what? 我注意到很多年轻人在点单时会混用中英文，就像'我要一杯caramel macchiato，少冰'这样~ 从linguistic perspective来看，这种code-mixing现象其实反映了语言接触(language contact)的深度呢！
[A]: Good afternoon! While I do appreciate the linguistic observation, I must say that in our boutique hotel, we prefer to maintain a consistent and elegant communication style. Our mixologists take great pride in crafting classic cocktails with proper terminology - we'd never say "我要一杯mojito" but rather "Would you care for our signature mojito, prepared with fresh mint from our garden?"
[B]: Ah, what a fascinating contrast in language ideologies! 😊 你们酒店的approach让我想起一个linguistic concept叫做'domain specificity' - 在不同social domains里我们会采用不同的language registers. 不过你知道吗？Even in high-end establishments,我注意到越来越多的顾客会自然地使用这种hybrid expressions呢~ 这其实是一种language evolution的体现哦！
[A]: How delightful to discuss language evolution over afternoon tea! Though I must gently point out that our establishment values tradition and clarity above all. Just yesterday, I recommended our seasonal elderflower gin fizz to a guest - "A refreshing blend of Hendrick's gin, St. Germain, and house-made citrus syrup" sounds far more sophisticated than any hybrid expression, don't you think?
[B]: Haha, 我完全理解你们对tradition的坚持！But let me share an interesting case study~ 在东京的一些高端bar里，mixologists会故意使用一些外来语(loanwords)来创造exotic appeal. 比如他们会说"このカクテルにはumamiの要素が..." 🤔 这说明即使是high-end hospitality industry，语言adaptation也是不可避免的evolutionary process呢！
[A]: My dear, while Tokyo's approach may be charming in its own way, we find our guests particularly appreciate the timeless elegance of proper English cocktail terminology. Why, just this morning I suggested our "Bees Knees - a prohibition-era classic with gin, honey, and lemon" to a distinguished guest from Paris. The poetic rhythm of such descriptions simply can't be replicated with code-switching, now can it?
[B]: Oh là là~ 你提到的这个例子太perfect了！这让我想到一个linguistic phenomenon叫做'prestige dialect' - 在某些social contexts中，pure English确实会carry more symbolic capital呢！不过有趣的是，在巴黎的酒吧里，他们反而会骄傲地使用French terms like 'aperitif'或'digestif'... 所以你看，language prestige其实是context-dependent的，right? 😊
[A]: How absolutely fascinating! Though I must say, our hotel's philosophy aligns more with Parisian establishments in that regard - we cherish the authenticity of each language in its proper place. For instance, we'd never anglicize "champagne" or "sommelier," just as we wouldn't francify our cocktail menu. Consistency and authenticity, my dear, that's the hallmark of true hospitality.
[B]: 啊！This discussion is giving me such rich material for my next lecture on language attitudes! ✍️ 你知道吗？你刚才提到的'consistency vs. authenticity' dichotomy正是现代sociolinguistics里最hot的debate之一呢~ 不过从cognitive linguistics角度来看，human brain其实很擅长处理这种multilingual input的。Fascinating, isn't it?
[A]: While your academic perspective is quite intriguing, I'm afraid I must return to assisting our guests with their dinner reservations. Though I do hope you'll join us for our weekly wine tasting - we'll be featuring exquisite Bordeaux varieties, properly pronounced and described in their original French, naturally. Good day!
[B]: What a delightful conversation! 下次我一定来参加你们的wine tasting event~ 说不定还能收集到更多关于language prestige的real-world data呢！À bientôt! 😊
[A]: How lovely! Though I must gently remind you that during our wine tastings, we maintain a strictly English-speaking environment to ensure all guests feel equally included. We look forward to welcoming you properly - perhaps for our Wednesday evening champagne reception? The invitation would of course be in impeccable English. Goodbye for now!
[B]: Oh what a perfect example of language policy in action! 这让我想起Fishman的domain theory呢~ 不过你知道吗？Even in这样的English-only settings，我打赌一定会出现一些有趣的language contact phenomena！See you Wednesday then - 我会带着我的research notebook来的 📝
[A]: I'm delighted you'll be joining us, though I must insist our sommelier's commentary will be purely in English - no research notebooks at the table please, we find it disrupts the elegant ambiance. Now if you'll excuse me, I see a guest arriving who requires my assistance with their reservation. Do enjoy the rest of your afternoon!
[B]: 啊，这就是典型的'language policing'案例呢~ 不过从ethnographic research的角度来看，这种interaction本身也很有研究价值！Have a wonderful day - 我会把今天的对话记在mental notes里的！😉 (小声说：我的notebook其实就藏在handbag里呢~)
[A]:  How utterly... academic of you. Though I must remind all our guests that recording devices are strictly prohibited in the tasting room. Now if you'll pardon me, I believe our head sommelier is signaling that the '85 Margaux needs immediate attention. Good day!
[B]: Oh là là~ 那个'85 Margaux！Now that's a language even my research notebook can't capture properly - 只有亲自savor才能appreciate its nuances呢！Enjoy your wine emergency~ 我们周三见！🍷  我的field notes会继续...incognito style~
[A]:  How positively... clandestine. Though I should mention our security team has rather sophisticated detection methods for... research equipment. Now if you'll excuse me, I must attend to that Margaux before it breathes too long. Until Wednesday - and do leave the notebook at home, there's a dear.
[B]: Oh mon dieu! 你们对ambiance的坚持简直像法国Académie française保护法语纯洁性一样严格呢~ 😄 不过作为一个linguist，我必须说这种language management策略本身就是一个绝佳的case study！周三见~ (小声：或许我们可以compromise - 我用记忆宫殿technique?)
