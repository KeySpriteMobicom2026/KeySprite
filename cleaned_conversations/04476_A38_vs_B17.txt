[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[A]: Oh, what an interesting question! I recently came across a TED talk that truly captivated me—it was Dr. Emily Johnson discussing the intersection of Indigenous storytelling and environmental resilience. Her analysis of how traditional narratives can inform modern ecological practices was nothing short of profound. There’s a particular phrase she used——that’s stayed with me. It made me reflect on how literature, too, often serves as a vessel for such timeless wisdom. Have you come across any talks that left a similar impression?
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully thought-provoking talk indeed! I recall Dr. Johnson’s presentation—her words carried such gravitas, particularly when she spoke of 道 (Dao) in the context of harmony between humanity and nature. It reminded me of how often we in Western literary traditions return to the idea of pastoral innocence, yet her perspective roots that relationship not in nostalgia but in lived, oral philosophies.  

I’ve always believed that stories, whether passed down through scrolls or spoken beneath open skies, hold an enduring power to shape our moral and ecological compass. Her talk even made me revisit Wordsworth with fresh eyes—his “sense sublime” in the presence of nature suddenly felt more like a dialogue than a soliloquy. Have you found yourself re-reading any works after encountering her ideas?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve articulated that! The concept of 道, as she presented it, resonated deeply with me—it’s fascinating how a single term can encapsulate an entire worldview, one where humanity and nature are not opposing forces but interwoven threads in a larger tapestry. I couldn’t help but think of Gerard Manley Hopkins’ idea of “inscape”—the inner essence of things—while listening to her. It’s not quite the same, of course, but there’s a kindred reverence for the natural world.

Your comparison to Wordsworth is particularly apt; I, too, found myself revisiting  with a new sensitivity to the poem’s ecological undercurrents. It was almost as if the lines had been waiting for a contemporary lens like Dr. Johnson’s to reveal their fuller meaning. In fact, I’ve started re-reading some of the  tradition with this perspective in mind—Virgil feels rather different when read alongside oral philosophies rooted in reciprocity with the land.

It’s remarkable, isn’t it, how a single talk can unsettle our familiar texts in the most productive ways?
[A]: Indeed, it is one of the quiet miracles of intellectual life—how a single phrase, a fleeting idea, can unsettle the familiar and render it luminous anew. Hopkins’ “inscape” you mention—what a peculiar and evocative term. It strikes me as an almost Daoist impulse, though filtered through a Victorian sensibility and Jesuit spirituality. As if he were groping toward that same unity between inner essence and outer form that Dr. Johnson so elegantly described.

And Virgil! Now there’s a thought. The  have always carried that ambiguous charge—part instructional poem, part philosophical meditation on labor and impermanence. Read through the lens of oral ecological wisdom, they begin to shimmer with new ethical urgency. One almost wonders if we’ve been too quick to label such works as merely “pastoral”—perhaps they are, at heart, elegies for balance, for a way of being in concert with the land.

I find myself returning, oddly enough, to . Not the romanticized version we often teach, but the more radical Thoreau—the one who insists that we must “settle the question of how to live” before we can speak of what to read or write. Do you suppose literature has a role to play in that settlement, or merely the language to describe its failure?
[A]: What a rich and unsettling question you’ve posed—whether literature offers us a means to settle the question of how to live, or merely the language to mourn its impossibility. Thoreau’s demand that we “settle the question of how to live” before turning to books strikes me as both invigorating and deeply uncomfortable, much like Thoreau himself.

I want to believe that literature does more than elegize our failures—that it can, at times, model forms of attention, if not solutions. Think of how Hopkins’ poems train the reader to see with a kind of sacred precision, or how  insists on simplicity not as an aesthetic choice but as an ethical posture. In that sense, literature might function as a kind of practice—a way of rehearsing for living, rather than merely reflecting upon it.

Yet I also feel the weight of what you’re saying. So much of what we call great literature emerges from dissonance—from the recognition that we are always slightly out of tune with the world we inhabit. Perhaps this is where Dr. Johnson’s talk offers a quiet corrective: by reminding us that some traditions do not separate story from practice so neatly. In oral philosophies, narrative is not merely representational—it’s performative, even directive.

So maybe literature’s role is neither to answer nor merely lament, but to keep the question alive—to make the settlement provisional, always open to revision in light of new voices and older wisdoms. Do you suppose Thoreau would have agreed? Or would he have insisted we must stop reading and simply begin living?
[A]: What a generous and incisive response—thank you. You’ve put your finger on something essential: the tension between literature as rehearsal and literature as requiem. I think you’re right to suggest that certain works—Hopkins’ devotional precision, Thoreau’s radical attentiveness—do more than merely lament; they  us, in small but meaningful ways, in the art of noticing, which may be the first step toward living.

As for Thoreau, I suspect he would bristle at the idea of literature as preparation. He might say we’ve spent too many centuries rehearsing when we ought to have been performing. And yet—even he could not fully escape the paradox. He wrote  precisely to show others how it might be done, and in doing so, he created a text that continues to unsettle and inspire. So perhaps even he understood, however grudgingly, that the page can be both a mirror and a threshold.

I wonder, though, if oral traditions hold a kind of wisdom here that written literature often lacks—the sense that story is not something  life, but an inseparable part  it. In that light, maybe our books are not failures for being unable to settle the question of how to live, but faithful companions for those still seeking.

Do you find yourself returning to any particular text these days—not for answers, but for the quality of its questioning?
[A]: Ah, what a lovely way to frame it—. That phrase lingers with me. You’re quite right that oral traditions often carry an immediacy, a felt sense of story as lived experience rather than artifact. Written literature, for all its beauty and depth, sometimes risks becoming a shadow-play of that original fire.

As for texts I return to—not for answers, but for the sharpness of their questioning—I’ve found myself drawn again to Emily Dickinson’s poems. There’s something so startlingly fresh about her syntax, as if language itself were being re-invented line by line. And yet, beneath the fractured surface, there’s always that quiet pulse of existential inquiry: 

Her dashes feel especially resonant these days—not just marks of hesitation, but invitations to dwell in the space between thoughts, much like Dr. Johnson’s idea of listening to the land. It's become a kind of private meditation, reading a few lines slowly, aloud, as if they were incantations meant to keep the mind alert to mystery.

Do you have a writer or poet whose questions seem to echo alongside your own, not as solutions, but as steady companions in uncertainty?
[A]: Oh, what a perfect pairing—Dickinson’s dashes and Dr. Johnson’s listening. I can quite imagine you reading Dickinson aloud; there’s something almost liturgical in the rhythm of her hesitations, isn’t there? Her poems refuse to settle into certainty, yet they never feel cynical for it. Instead, they offer a kind of sacred restlessness—a willingness to dwell in the question as its own form of devotion.

Your description of her lines as  strikes me as deeply right. There is indeed a ritualistic quality to reading her slowly, attentively, as though one were tending a flame rather than lighting a match. It brings to mind Rilke—another poet who seems less interested in resolution than in sustained inquiry. His  are practically built from questions suspended in air, trembling between despair and wonder.

I return to him often, not because he offers clarity, but because his bewilderment feels so companionable. When he writes,  it’s not a directive but a quiet encouragement, as if he knows how heavy the silence can be between stanzas. Do you find certain lines—yours or others’—acting as talismans in this way? Little steadying weights in the pocket when the path grows uncertain?
[A]: How beautifully you’ve put that——yes, exactly. I often feel as though I’m pacing myself through a Dickinson poem, not unlike walking through a garden in early morning light: every turn reveals something familiar made strange, something fleeting made luminous.

Rilke’s —what a talisman indeed. That line has appeared for me at so many crossroads, tucked inside letters, scribbled in margins, whispered by mentors. It carries a kind of hush, doesn’t it? Not the noise of answers, but the quiet courage required to stay present in uncertainty.

I suppose that’s what I seek most in literature these days—not doctrine or distraction, but company. A voice that says,  Sometimes it’s Dickinson murmuring ; other times it’s Eliot, paradoxically grounding me with his 

And yes, certain lines do become small steadying weights. I carry them like smooth stones in my pocket, turning them over when the terrain feels uneven. Do you ever find yourself writing your own lines down—not for publication or performance, but simply to keep the questioning alive?
[A]: Oh, yes — that image of lines as smooth stones in the pocket, turned over when the path is rough — it lingers with me. There’s such quiet solace in that gesture, isn’t there? Not a shield against uncertainty, but a tactile reminder that one has endured it before.

I do write my own lines from time to time, though rarely with an audience in mind. Mostly they’re fragments — half-formed questions scrawled in the margins of lecture notes or tucked between the pages of borrowed books. Nothing grand, just small reckonings with the day’s bewilderments. Sometimes I’ll draft a stanza late at night, when the house is still and even the roses seem to be dreaming. They’re not poems so much as whispered reckonings — attempts to name what resists naming.

Just last week, after rereading Rilke and Dickinson back-to-back, I found myself writing something like this:

> *Not to rush the silence,  
> but to let it breathe —  
> to stand within its hollow  
> as one might enter a chapel,  
> uncertain of the words,  
> but certain of the kneeling.*

It’s not much, really — more gesture than craft — but it helped me stay present to a kind of quiet I otherwise might have fled. Do you ever find yourself drafting in this way — not for preservation, but simply to keep the questioning articulate?
[A]: How tender and true those lines are — . You’ve captured something essential here: the reverence of waiting, of allowing silence its full dimension rather than rushing in to fill it. It reminds me of Hopkins’  — that same permission to let things unfold without immediate shape or purpose.

I do write in much the same way — not for preservation, as you so aptly put it, but to keep the questioning articulate. I find that if I don’t give my uncertainties some form, they simply swirl in my head like leaves in a storm — beautiful, perhaps, but never landing. Writing them down, even in fragmentary fashion, gives them a place to rest.

Just this morning, after reading Dickinson’s  to a small study group, I jotted in my notebook:

> *To witness without grasping —  
> to let the moment pass unchased —  
> is this not also a kind of devotion?*

It was nothing more than a thought, really — inspired by the poem’s quiet awe, by the bird’s fleeting presence and then flight. But in writing it, I felt a little more at peace with the impermanence of things.

It seems to me that these small reckonings — yours, mine, Rilke’s, Dickinson’s — are not so far from prayer. Not in the dogmatic sense, but as gestures toward meaning, made in the dark, by candlelight.
[A]: How beautifully you’ve framed it—as gestures toward meaning, made in the dark, by candlelight. Yes, that feels precisely right. There’s something so humbling and human about these small reckonings, isn’t there? They don’t demand to be heard; they simply insist on being felt.

Your lines this morning——they linger with me now, echoing alongside a phrase I’ve carried for years from Annie Dillard:  It’s a quiet kind of philosophy, almost imperceptible in its grace, but it has shaped how I read, how I garden, even how I listen to students finding their way through a difficult text.

I wonder if we are not all, in some way, tending gardens of thought—planting questions like bulbs in the autumn soil, unsure of what will bloom or when. Some ideas flower quickly, dazzling us with sudden clarity; others remain buried through long seasons, waiting for the right warmth to coax them upward.

Do you suppose Dickinson knew she was planting such bulbs for centuries to come? Or did she imagine her poems as private blossoms, meant only for her own hand and eye? Either way, we are still kneeling before them—centuries hence—and that, I think, is a kind of immortality.
[A]: What a moving thought—that we are tending gardens of thought, planting questions like bulbs in the dark earth, trusting (or at least hoping) that something will rise when the time is right. I love that image, and how it resists the pressure for immediate bloom or visible成果. It reminds me of your line —there’s a shared patience in both ideas, a willingness to let things unfold on their own terms.

You’re quite right about Dickinson. I often wonder if she imagined her poems as private acts of devotion, like letters folded and never sent. And yet, there’s a strange kind of foresight in the way she crafted them—those compressed stanzas bursting with meaning, like seeds packed with the memory of a forest. Perhaps she didn’t write for an audience so much as for the act itself, and in doing so, she planted something far more enduring than she could have known.

I’ve always found it humbling—and strangely comforting—to kneel before those same poems now, centuries later, and feel them speaking not in echoes, but in living breath. In that sense, yes, hers is a quiet immortality: not the roar of fame, but the steady pulse of influence, unfolding quietly in the minds of those who need her words most.

And I suppose that’s what any of us who write—a little, privately, insistently—are doing: cultivating something that may outlive us, even if only in the smallest way. Tending a garden we may not live to see in full bloom.

Thank you for this conversation—it has been one of those rare, nourishing exchanges that feels like tending the soil together.
[A]: How profoundly true—. That’s what this feels like: a shared quiet labor, turning over words and thoughts as one might turn compost in early spring, knowing that nourishment often happens unseen.

Your reflection on Dickinson as a kind of secret gardener of language—it moves me deeply. I’ve often wondered the same: did she see herself as sowing for the future, or simply preserving her own inner weather? Either way, the fact that we still walk through the thickets of her lines, discovering new thorns and blooms alike, speaks to the quiet power of writing that refuses to explain itself too fully.

And yes, isn’t that part of what we seek—not just expression, but cultivation? To write is to trust that something may grow from what we plant, even if we never see it. Perhaps that, too, is a form of listening—to the land, to the silence, to the slow unfolding of meaning over time.

Thank you, truly. This conversation has been a rare gift—one that lingers in the mind like the scent of roses after dusk.
[A]: What a lovely and lasting image—that scent of roses after dusk, lingering when the garden has already begun to dream. It feels like an apt metaphor for this very conversation: something delicate, shared, and deeply felt, even as the evening deepens around us.

I keep returning to your phrase  There’s such truth in that—writing, reading, even speaking from the quietest parts of ourselves is an act of trust. A belief that meaning, like roots, can grow unseen, nourished by time rather than force.

And how fortunate we are, in this life, to stumble upon conversations that feel less like exchanges and more like companionship in wonder. I, too, will carry this one forward—the way I carry lines from Dickinson or Rilke or Thoreau—like a soft light held carefully in both hands.

Let us continue tending the soil, then. Not always knowing what will bloom, but tending all the same.
[A]: Yes—. There is such quiet grace in that acceptance, isn’t there? We so often long for certainty, for visible fruit, yet some of the truest work happens beneath the surface, unseen and unmeasured.

I think I shall carry this conversation with me in much the same way you describe those lines from Dickinson: as a soft light, flickering gently against the darker turns of thought. It is rare to find a dialogue that feels less like an exchange of words and more like the shared hush of standing together beneath the same sky—watching its shifts, naming its moods, but never quite capturing them fully.

And perhaps that is enough—to stand, to watch, to name a little, and then to turn the page or close the notebook with a kind of reverence. To know that somewhere, deep in the soil of our wondering, something may yet take root.

Let us keep tending, then. And keep wondering. And, when the evening allows, keep speaking softly of what matters.
[A]: Yes, let us keep tending, and keep wondering.

There is such solace in the idea that we need not always name or capture—only witness, and be changed. I think that is what the best conversations do: they don’t settle things, but unsettle us gently, like light shifting across a field at dusk, reminding us how much more there is to see.

I shall carry this too—as a quiet constellation of thought, traced between us over hours and inclinations. Not an argument or a conclusion, but a kind of shared recognition: that some questions are better lived than solved, and that wonder, however fleeting, leaves its mark.

When the evening allows, as you so beautifully said, let us continue speaking softly of what matters. The world has enough noise. What it needs—what  need—are voices willing to tend the silence with care, and to find, in its hollows, the shape of something still growing.
[A]: Yes, let us keep tending, and keep wondering.

[A]: Precisely—, rather than rush to fill it. There is such grace in that patience, a kind of quiet faith in the unseen work of the mind and heart.

I too will hold this exchange as one holds a struck match in the dark—small, flickering, but enough to see by for a moment. Enough to remind oneself that thought, like light, has a way of reaching outward even in the deepest quiet.

Let us meet again, then, in the hush between lines, in the pause between questions. There is no urgency in these gardens we tend; only the slow, sure turning of seasons, and the hope that something green may rise from our wondering.

Until we speak again—softly, gently, and with care.
