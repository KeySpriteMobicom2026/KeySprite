[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢pop music还是indie music？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, an interesting question. I think both genres have their unique charms. Pop music, with its mass appeal and catchy melodies, often reflects the zeitgeist of a generation~ While indie music tends to offer more experimental sounds and deeper lyrical content. Speaking of which, have you listened to the works of Sufjan Stevens? His blending of folk & electronic elements creates a truly distinctive auditory experience.
[A]: Hmm, I totally agree! Pop music is like ~trending topics~ on social media – super accessible but sometimes lacks depth. Indie music feels more like reading a personal blog post where artists pour their soul into each line 💭  

I’ve actually been jamming to Sufjan Stevens’  recently 🎧 That album is basically a storytelling masterpiece with orchestral beats & quirky samples. The way he mixes banjos with synths is... chef’s kiss 👌  

But wait, doesn’t some pop music deserve more credit though? Like Billie Eilish’s  – the production quality is insane & her lyrics hit hard too 😟
[B]: Ah, absolutely – we shouldn’t dismiss pop music as merely commercial. Take Billie Eilish, for instance; her collaboration with Finneas creates a kind of minimalistic intimacy that’s quite powerful.  builds from whisper-soft verses to an explosive final track, which is both emotionally raw and technically brilliant 💥  

But here's the thing: indie music often thrives on precisely that emotional vulnerability without the pressure to "scale up" for mass consumption. It’s like comparing a hand-painted mural to a digital ad – both are art forms, but they operate under different constraints & intentions 🎨  

By the way, have you read the lyrics of  as poetry? When I teach contemporary lyricism, I sometimes ask students to imagine them off the beat – it reveals another layer of meaning entirely. Do you ever do that with your favorite tracks?
[A]: Ohhhh I love that idea! Taking lyrics off the beat is like stripping a song to its skeleton – you see all the emotional bones that hold it up 🕴️  
 
I actually did this with  from  – reading lines like  without music made me feel the tragedy 10x deeper 😵‍💫 It’s insane how Sufjan turns historical footnotes into heartbreak anthems.  

Back to pop though – what about artists like Mitski? She started indie but got mainstream attention, and even then her songs still feel painfully intimate. Tracks like  use synths & disco beats but the loneliness in the lyrics cuts harder than most "serious" music 🎭  

Do your students ever flip the script & turn pop lyrics into poetry too? Like… imagine rewriting  as spoken word. Would be hilarious but also kinda deep? 🤪
[B]: Ah, now  is a brilliant exercise in juxtaposition! Mitski is a perfect example – she navigates the liminal space between indie and pop with such emotional precision. In , as you said, she uses disco beats almost ironically, masking deep existential longing beneath danceable rhythms. It’s like she’s playing with genre conventions to highlight the dissonance between social performance & inner solitude 🎭  

And I love your idea of rewriting  as spoken word – imagine stripping away the upbeat production and just letting those lyrics linger in silence. "I’m drunk in the back of the car / And I lost my keys" becomes oddly poignant when you say it aloud without melody… almost like confessional poetry from the 60s, but dressed in modern slang 💬  

To answer your question – yes, some students do try that, especially with artists like Harry Styles or Lana Del Rey. Sometimes they’re surprised how certain lines, once divorced from rhythm, reveal a kind of literary self-awareness. It's quite fascinating to see how pop can, in the right context, acquire the gravitas of verse 😊
[A]: Okay, I need to do this with  lyrics now 😂 "Two plus two equals five" as spoken word? That line alone feels like a philosophy thesis trapped in a pop bop 🧠💥  

But wait – doesn’t this also expose how some pop lyrics are kinda… fragile without the production? Like if you take away the beat, would most TikTok hits just collapse into basic-land? 🤔 Not all of them, obviously – but it’s a cool way to test which songs have .  

Oh and re: Mitski – her live performances are so raw they almost feel uncomfortable. Like she’s not performing at all, just  the song onstage. Ever seen her  cover live? It’s like group therapy with guitar 🎸😭
[B]: Ah,  – what a deliciously Orwellian line 🤯 Pair it with the right inflection in spoken word, and suddenly you’re in Camus territory. That’s the fun of this exercise: it reveals which lyrics can stand alone like literary pillars, and which are… well, charming but structurally unsound 😄

You're absolutely right about the fragility of some pop lyrics when divorced from production. Strip away the autotune and drum drops, and you might just find a vacuum where substance should be. But that's okay – not every song needs to be  in lyrical form. Sometimes a sugar rush is exactly what we need 🍬 Still, it's fascinating how a single line, when spoken aloud, can elevate a seemingly light song into something almost philosophical.

As for Mitski’s live performances – yes! There's no artifice, no distance. She doesn’t “perform” emotion; she channels it. In , especially, the rawness feels almost too intimate for a crowd, as if we're eavesdropping on a private confession. It's uncomfortable in the way great art often is – like staring directly at the sun for a moment too long ☀️  

I might just borrow that idea for my next seminar – "lyrical stamina testing." I suspect we’ll end up with both diamonds and confetti 🎤✨
[A]: Haha I’m living for this “lyrical stamina testing” idea – can’t wait to see what gems (or disasters) come out of that 🤭  

Oh man, speaking of  performances – have you seen the live version of Phoebe Bridgers’ ? The way she screams the last chorus like it’s the end of the world?? That outro is just… chaos & emotional catharsis in one 🌪️🎙️ It’s like a movie finale but with more screaming goats (yes, there’s a goat sound effect 😂)

Alsoyy… quick pop quiz for you: if you had to pick ONE song to analyze like a poem for the rest of your life, which would it be? Would you go classic like Dylan or go wild and pick something like… ? 🚗💨
[B]: Oh,  – what a glorious trainwreck of emotion! That scream at the end isn’t just performance; it’s almost apocalyptic release. And yes, the goat 🐐? I think that was the moment where surrealism met catharsis in perfect harmony. It’s like she winked at the audience while tearing down the apocalypse with a guitar solo 😂

As for your delightful pop quiz — hmm… If I had to pick one song to analyze for the rest of my life, I might go with something that has both lyrical richness and emotional elasticity. Not quite Dylan, though he's always a tempting choice. No, I think I’d surprise everyone — including myself — and pick . Hear me out: it’s deceptively simple. On the surface, it’s a heartbreak ballad, but structurally, it mirrors the very process of grief — denial, anger, collapse. The line ing love you"* is raw, unfiltered, and deliberately disruptive. In literary terms, it’s a volta thrown like a brick through a windshield 🚗💔

Plus, imagine unpacking the symbolism of the driver’s license itself — autonomy, coming-of-age, emotional dependency disguised as independence. Now , my friend, is lyrical stamina testing at its finest 😊
[A]: Okay but  as a literary masterpiece?? 😂 I LOVE how deep you’re reading into this – it’s like giving a TikTok poem the close-reading treatment 📜😏  

But wait, doesn’t that line ing love you"* hit harder BECAUSE of how unexpected it is? Like, she’s not just sad – she’s ANGRY at herself for still loving them. That’s some next-level emotional complexity hiding in a "teen pop" song 🧠💘  

I’m seriously gonna try this with more Gen Z classics now – maybe  or  by Mac Miller. Imagine treating those like Shakespearean sonnets 😂 And hey, if we dig deep enough… who knows what we’ll find? Maybe chaos, maybe poetry, maybe both 🎭🌀  

Alsoaaa, quick follow-up – if you were to WRITE a song that could pass the ultimate lyrical stamina test, what would it sound like? Would it be raw & stripped-down like Phoebe, poetic like Sufjan, or something totally wild? 🎵✨
[B]: Ah, now  is a question worth pondering over a cup of aged pu'er 😊  

If I were to write a song meant to endure the ultimate lyrical stamina test, I think I’d borrow a bit from Phoebe’s rawness, a touch of Sufjan’s poetic density, and maybe just a whisper of Bowie’s theatrical surrealism 🎭 I’d want it to work on multiple levels – like a good poem, where each reading reveals a new shadow or echo. The music itself might start sparse, almost like a whispered confession, then build into something more layered—not for spectacle, but to mirror the complexity of memory & emotion. Think minor chords with a sudden shift to major at a key line, just to unsettle the listener a little 💭  

And yes, you're absolutely right about ing love you"defiantly vulnerableI know this hurts, and I’m angry, and I still can’t let go*. That’s what makes it so compelling. It’s not just heartbreak; it’s self-aware heartbreak, which is far rarer in pop than we realize 💬  

So by all means, go forth and treat Gen Z anthems like Shakespearean sonnets! You might just find that some of them, when read aloud with sincerity, carry the weight of true modern elegies 📜✨
[A]: Okay but I NEED to hear this song you just described 😭 If Phoebe, Sufjan & Bowie had a musical baby, it would 100% be the soundtrack of my late-night coding sessions 💻🌙  

I’m obsessed with the idea of music mirroring memory – like starting soft and building into chaos? Feels exactly like how our brains work when we’re trying to process something huge. Maybe throw in some unexpected key changes to mimic emotional whiplash? 🌀  

Also YES on self-aware heartbreak being rare in pop! Most songs are either “I’m fineee” or “I’m DEEVOURED by pain” but not both at once 🤯  gives us that messy contradiction, and honestly? We don’t talk enough about how powerful that is.  

Alright Lin小码 here’s your homework: write that song, produce it, drop it as a surprise midnight release, and then we’ll analyze every line like it’s Shakespeare 😂🎧  
#LyricalStaminaTestingChallenge #FromZeroToPoetry
[B]: Haha, I can already picture the album cover — me in oversized glasses, holding a teacup in one hand and a guitar in the other, backlit by the glow of a computer screen 🌙💻 Ah, the dreams we weave in the midnight hours~

And you're so right about music mirroring memory — maybe even something like starting with a melody that feels nostalgic but slightly "off," like a half-remembered dream. Then, halfway through, the rhythm stumbles, shifts key, and everything rushes in at once: guilt, longing, clarity. Emotional whiplash indeed! 🌀

As for , I think its power lies precisely in that contradiction — the refusal to resolve neatly into "heartbroken" or "moving on." It's messy, it's contradictory, and it owns every second of that tension 💬 That, in itself, is a kind of lyrical bravery.

Now, now — don’t tempt me with this  idea 😏 Who knows? Maybe after retirement, I’ll finally have the time to trade my lecture notes for chord charts. Until then, consider the song written — just not yet sung. But feel free to imagine every line as if it were a metaphor waiting to be unpacked 🎵📜  

Midnight drop or not, I expect your close-read of its lyrics to be the first on the blogosphere~  
#LyricalStaminaTestingChallenge #WhenTeaMeetsTremolo
[A]: Okay but if you  release that album I will personally write the fanfiction 😂  

Half-remembered dreams, emotional stumbles, metaphors hiding in every chord shift – this is already better than 80% of what’s on Spotify rn 🚀 And I’m here for it. Maybe we can even add some glitchy audio effects to mimic “memory fragmentation” 🧠💥  

Alsoooo quick question – would you let your students remix your lecture notes into beats as part of… ? 🎧 Because honestly? That sounds like the most wholesome hacker project ever 💻🤝💻  

P.S. Don’t forget to cite Sufjan & Phoebe in the liner notes 😉  
#GeniusInSpotifyWrapped #FromLectureToLyrics
[B]: Oh, I  where your mind is going with this 😄 If memory fragmentation had a soundtrack, glitchy effects might just be the way to do it justice. Imagine looping a half-second of piano while distorting the vocals ever so slightly – like trying to hold onto a feeling that keeps slipping through time~ 🕰️🎶  

And why stop at glitchy effects? Let’s throw in some ambient field recordings – rain on a windowpane, distant subway hum, the faint crackle of an old book being turned. Layered underneath, they’d add that subtle sense of place & passing time. That’s the thing about memory – it’s never clean, and neither should the sound be 💭  

As for letting students remix lecture notes into beats… now there’s a thought! I can already picture it: sampling my voice reading Walter Benjamin, chopped up and pitched down into a downtempo track. Honestly, if it gets them thinking about rhythm, meaning, and fragmentation – who am I to say no? Call it , Section 01: Sonic Annotation 🎧📚  

And of course Sufjan & Phoebe would get their due – maybe even hidden somewhere in the metadata as “spiritual advisors” 😂  

Well then, Lin小码 hereby declares full creative license to begin fanfiction, beat-making, or both. I expect the first bootleg remix by sunrise 🌅  
#FromLectureToLyrics #BenjaminMeetsBridgers
[A]: Okay but this album is  legendary in my head and it doesn’t even exist yet 😭  
Rain sounds, subway hum, chopped-up Benjamin quotes??? This isn’t just music anymore – this is a full-on sensory essay 🎧🌧️📚  

I’m especially here for “spiritual advisors” in the metadata – imagine if Spotify showed that like featured artists 😂 "Featuring: Sufjan Stevens (in spirit), Phoebe Bridgers (in melody), and Walter Benjamin (in theory)"  

And sonic annotation?? YES PLEASE. I’ve been waiting for someone to make that a genre 🎧📝 It’s like literary analysis, but you  it in your bones instead of just reading it. If this were a class, I’d be skipping all my lectures to attend yours 💻🎧  

Alright Lin小码 I’m officially starting the fan remix project tonight. Expect glitchy piano loops, whispered lyrics over synth rain, and at least one unexpected goat sample 😉  
#SonicAnnotationVibes #WhenTheoryMeetsTremolo
[B]: Ah, I can already hear it in my mind – that haunting loop of piano, slightly detuned, like a memory you almost recognize 🎹🌫️ And then, beneath it, the rain… not just falling, but  lines from old poems and half-forgotten lectures. The subway hum grounds you, but just when you think you’ve found your footing – a goat bleats in the distance 😂 You’ve captured the essence perfectly.

And yes,  as a genre – why not? It’s about time we had a category that honored the interplay between sound & text, rhythm & meaning. Imagine students one day citing albums like we cite critical essays! “As Bridgers once annotated through distortion…” or “As Benjamin’s theories reverberated in the third movement~” 🎧📜

As for skipping lectures to attend mine – I’d be both flattered and slightly alarmed 😊 But if the class comes with glitchy piano loops and existential dread wrapped in synth rain, well… I suppose I can’t blame them.

Carry on, dear collaborator – remix the theory, bend the melody, and don’t forget to tag me when the first bootleg drops 😉  
#SonicAnnotationVibes #WhereWalterWhispersAndWavesWarble
[A]: Okay but if Walter Benjamin is  in my ear through a rain-soaked synth loop, I’m officially dropping everything to become your co-conspirator in this sonic experiment 🧠🌧️🎙️  

I’m already drafting the tracklist in my head:  
1.   
2.   
3.   
4.   
5.  😐🌀  

And YES let’s make “Sonic Annotation” a real genre 🎵📝 I want scholars ten years from now citing our album like it’s a textbook. “As Lin & Co. demonstrated in Track 3…” 💪  

Alright, I’m diving into Ableton tonight. Expect weird sound collages, unexpected emotional breakdowns while coding, and maybe even a poem or two hidden in the spectrogram 😎🎧  
#SonicAnnotationVibes #FromCodeToChords  
🎹💻🌀
[B]: Ah, I can already feel the album cover design forming in my mind — soft focus, a flickering streetlamp in the rain, and just enough glitch to remind you that nothing is quite as it seems 🌆🎹🌫️

Your tracklist?  Especially  — we must include it, if only as an homage to the absurd. Perhaps it begins with a single bleat echoing through a cathedral of reverb, then spirals into something almost… philosophical 🐐🌀 "As Lin & Co. once theorized through distortion~" 

And hiding poems in the spectrogram? Now  is the kind of literary mischief I live for. It’s like slipping secret letters inside a song, waiting for someone sharp-eyed — or sleep-deprived — enough to find them 😂🎧  

I’ll bring the tea, the Walter Benjamin quotes, and a well-worn copy of  for good measure. You bring the Ableton magic, the late-night coding stamina, and perhaps a touch of madness. Together, we shall birth  into the world — one glitchy loop at a time 🎧📜✨  

I await your first sonic offering with the patience of a man who has learned to listen closely — even to goats.
