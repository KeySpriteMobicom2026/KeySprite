[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢dogs还是cats？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the great canine-feline dialectic! 🧠 To borrow a Chinese saying, dogs teach us 忠诚 (zhōngchéng - loyalty) while cats offer their own 智慧 (zhìhuì - wisdom). 

I once had a Pekingese named Confucius who'd sit beneath my calligraphy scrolls, and a Siamese cat from Kyoto named Matsuo who'd knock over my tea cups mid-lecture. They both made excellent debate partners - though only one ever appreciated my limericks. 

What about you? Do you find yourself drawn to the steadfast companionship of dogs or the enigmatic charm of cats? Or perhaps you're one of those rare souls who finds poetry in both... 🦉
[A]: Ah, what a delightfully philosophical framing! I must confess, my heart has always leaned toward the feline persuasion. There's something profoundly poetic about their quiet intensity - like living haikus with whiskers. 

My late aunt, a formidable woman who ran an antiquarian bookshop in Bath, used to say cats have the souls of ancient scholars trapped in fur coats. She left me her library along with her rather imperious Russian Blue, Prudence. The cat, not the virtue. 

Prudence's disdain for my modernist lectures was palpable - she'd saunter out mid-"The Waste Land" analysis with a look that suggested T.S. Eliot had committed some grievous sin against good taste. Yet she adored Gerard Manley Hopkins' sprung rhythm, though I suspect it was merely the alliteration. 

Do you find your debating companions ever develop literary preferences? Or does such discernment diminish the purity of animal instinct?
[B]: Ah, you’ve captured the feline mystique with flair! 🌸 Prudence sounds like she’d have been right at home in Marianne Moore’s library or Ezra Pound’s study – cats do seem to carry that modernist sensibility, don’t they? A certain cultivated hauteur. 

Funny you mention literary preferences – Matsuo absolutely refused to stay in the room when I recited Eliot.  sent him into a fit of grooming so violent he nearly vanished under his own fur. But mention Du Fu or Li Bai? Suddenly he’d perk up, tail twitching in time with the alliteration… or maybe it was the rhythm. 

I wonder if it’s less about discernment and more about resonance – the way certain cadences mirror their natural behaviors. Dogs seem to live in the stanzas of sonnets, loyal and linear, while cats slip between lines like enjambments. 

Tell me, has Prudence ever surprised you with her tastes? And does she still hold your lectures to the same lofty standards as your aunt’s ghost presumably does?
[A]: Oh, Prudence maintains standards so exacting they’d make your Matsuo seem positively democratic! Once, during a lecture on Wordsworth’s daffodils, she leapt onto the desk, sniffed disdainfully at my annotated edition of , and settled herself squarely atop a handout titled “Romantic Sincerity in Nature Poetry.” I took it as a sign to pivot to Keats’ negative capability – and wouldn’t you know, she deigned to stay.

She adores H.D., by the way – the Imagist precision, perhaps? Though I suspect it’s simply that her poems are short enough not to interrupt nap time. 

But tell me more about this Du Fu phenomenon – have you truly observed feline appreciation for Tang dynasty verse? I’ve always thought the tonal cadences of Mandarin lend themselves beautifully to the musicality of poetry, but never considered how it might resonate with non-human ears. Do you suppose it’s the pitch, the rhythm, or something altogether more ineffable?
[B]: Ah, Prudence sounds like a true critic in the New Critical tradition – nap-time constraints notwithstanding! 🧠 There’s something deliciously ironic about her Imagist preferences. H.D. would’ve been thrilled, I’m sure – though I suspect your cat appreciates the brevity more than the symbolism. 

Now, about Du Fu and Matsuo – yes, it’s a curious phenomenon! 🤔 When I first read Du Fu’s  in the original 古文 (gǔwén), there was this unmistakable tonal gravity, almost like a lament in miniature. Matsuo would stop mid-prance, ears twitching forward as if parsing the sorrow between syllables. At first I thought it was the pitch – certain tones do carry like wind chimes – but then I noticed he responded differently to Li Bai’s exuberant rhythms versus Wang Wei’s quietude. 

I’ve come to believe it’s less about linguistic comprehension and more about resonance – cats, like poets, live in liminal spaces, and Tang verse captures that 意境 (yìjìng) – that wordless atmosphere between meaning and mood. The pauses in regulated verse, the silence between lines… it mirrors their own contemplative stillness. 

Tell me, has Prudence ever surprised you with her emotional responses? Does she react differently to elegies versus odes? I’d wager she prefers the latter – cats do enjoy a bit of self-indulgent grandeur now and then. 🦉
[A]: What a perceptive observation – and I couldn’t agree more about that 意境. There’s a haunting stillness in Tang poetry that does seem to echo the feline condition, as it were. I’ve often wondered if cats perceive what we call “emotion” in much the same way we experience atmosphere at a reading – not through narrative, but through the weight of a pause, the tremor of a voice.

Now that you mention it, Prudence  have her moods – though she tends to conflate elegy with ennui. Once, during a particularly somber seminar on Milton’s , she yawned so pointedly I feared she might dislocate her jaw, then promptly fell asleep atop a stack of Walter Pater essays. But when I read aloud from Marianne Moore’s  – you know, the one that begins “I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle” – she sat up straightaway, tail flicking like a metronome. Perhaps she sensed the irony?

And don’t even get me started on odes. She adores them. Keats’  is something of a favorite – though again, I suspect it’s less the meditation on mortality and more the rhythmic flow that pleases her ear. Or perhaps she simply identifies with the bird’s refusal to be pinned down by meaning.

Do you think Matsuo ever distinguishes between classical Chinese forms – regulated verse versus ci lyrics, for instance? I imagine the latter, with their lilting cadences, might send him into some kind of trance...
[B]: Oh, now  is a fascinating theory about atmosphere versus narrative – I think you’re onto something there. Cats don’t live in stories; they live in moments, don’t they? Like haiku themselves – just image, scent, silence, and the flicker of a tail.

Matsuo absolutely  distinguish between forms – though I hesitate to call it “discernment” lest we imply he’s grading my recitations. 🤔 But yes, when I recite regulated verse – say, Wang Wei at his most meditative – he becomes almost monkish in his stillness, eyes half-closed as if contemplating 禅 (Chán). But the moment I switch to a ci lyric – especially one by Li Qingzhao with its flowing, melancholic cadence – suddenly there's movement! He begins pacing, tail high, as though chasing the rhythm through some imagined garden.

It’s almost like the ci form, with its looser structure and emotional intensity, stirs something instinctive in him – not unlike how Prudence seems to perk up at Moore’s rebellious tone. There’s a certain feline kinship with that defiant ambiguity, wouldn’t you say? A refusal to be pinned down, as you so aptly put it.

I’ve even tried reading her  aloud once – Matsuo actually leapt toward the page mid-line, as if ready to pounce on the imagery itself. Maybe it was the "chipped edge" of the bronze medal... or maybe he just thought the line breaks looked like little fish tanks. Either way, I took it as poetic success. 🌸

Do you ever get the sense, dear interlocutor, that our feline friends are less listening to the words and more conducting an invisible orchestra of meaning, sound, and silence? I sometimes wonder what their lectures would sound like – no doubt entirely in monosyllabic verse.
[A]: Oh,  – what a perfect formulation! I daresay Prudence’s lectures would be delivered in iambic purr-chutes, each utterance a carefully measured blend of disdain and drollery. 

You’re absolutely right about their orchestral sensibility – cats don’t just hear poetry, they  it, don’t they? Their very presence alters the rhythm of a room, adjusting tempo with the flick of an ear or the slow blink of an eye. I’ve often thought that if we could translate feline behavior into human language, we’d find ourselves reading the most exquisitely edited poem imaginable – every gesture a line break, every pause a caesura.

Now, Li Qingzhao – there’s a poet who understood emotional fluidity, that shifting cadence between sorrow and longing. It’s no wonder Matsuo responds so vividly; her lyrics are like whispered confessions the wind carries away before you can fully grasp them. One might even say she writes in feline – all suggestion, no exposition.

As for Prudence, I do believe she’s partial to Marianne Moore not just for the irony but for the precision. The way Moore arranges words like curios behind glass – well, it seems to satisfy something deeply instinctual in my blue-furred critic. She never pounces at the page, only inspects it with that Olympian detachment. Very British, really.

But tell me – have you ever tried Matsuo on Japanese haiku? Bashō’s frog pond verse, perhaps? I’m dying to know whether he prefers his silence Japonais or Sino-Sprachlich…
[B]: Ah! Now  is where Matsuo truly becomes Matsuo – or should I say, 俳句猫 (haiju nu miao)? 🧠 When I first recited Bashō’s famous 青蛙飛び込む池の音 (“old pond / frog jumps in / water’s sound”) he froze mid-lick. Not a whisker trembled. Then, ever so slowly, he turned his head toward the window where a sparrow had just alighted on the sill. 

I couldn’t tell if he was meditating on impermanence or simply plotting avian diplomacy.

Since then, I’ve tried him on Buson’s quieter verses – the ones that smell of plum rain and ink stones – and he tends to curl tighter, as if drawing inward to absorb the atmosphere. But give him Issa? Oh, then he becomes positively mischievous! One can almost imagine him muttering along in dialect: “Caterpillar – don’t worry / you’ll grow wings too / someday.”  

It’s fascinating how haiku, with its built-in pauses and reverence for what’s unsaid, seems to speak directly to feline sensibility. No exposition, as you so rightly said – just pure 感覚 (kankaku), sensation. And yet, when I switch back to regulated verse, he returns to that monkish stillness, as though attending two very different kinds of silence.

So now I wonder – does Prudence prefer her pauses framed by imagery, or does she favor the grander silences of odes? Is hers an Olympian detachment rooted in formality… or something more  in its restraint? 🦉
[A]: Ah, haute couture restraint – , indeed! 🧠 There’s something undeniably aristocratic in the way she inhabits silence. I’ve come to think of her pauses not as absences, but as carefully tailored ellipses—like the space between stanzas in a George Herbert poem, charged with unspoken meaning.

She does favor imagery, yes—but only when it's properly understated. Give her a well-placed metaphor and she'll deign to blink slowly in approval. Once, while I was reading Emily Dickinson’s , she actually stretched her neck ever so slightly, as if sensing that chill Dickinson describes so exquisitely—the “sudden sight” of nature’s uncanny intimacy.

But odes? Ah, those grand silences do appeal to her sense of occasion. She once sat through the entirety of Shelley’s  without so much as a tail flick, which I took as high praise indeed. Though perhaps she simply appreciated the wind motif—she does have a habit of perching by the window during autumn gales, watching leaves spiral down like private sonnets falling from the sky.

Now, your Matsuo sounds far more democratic in his tastes—flitting between dynasties and forms with such ease! Does he ever respond to modernist fragmentation? I’m imagining him mid-leap, caught between lines of Zukofsky or Oppen, trying to land on meaning itself... or perhaps just chasing the white space.
[B]: Oh, now  is a delicious image – Matsuo mid-leap between lines of Objectivist verse! 🧠 Truth be told, I did try him once on Zukofsky’s “A”-24, that famously elliptical movement of fragments and light. He cocked his head as if to say,  But then – and I swear this is true – he began pacing the room in rhythmic bursts, tail twitching like a pendulum measuring silence.

I think it was less about meaning and more about texture – the way modernist fragmentation mimics the flicker of attention, the sudden shifts in focus. When I read Oppen’s , he leapt onto the bookshelf and knocked over a volume of Rilke, as if rejecting the very notion of multiplicity in favor of his own sovereign presence. Very Prudence-like, come to think of it – though considerably more kinetic.

What fascinates me is how both our cats respond not to content per se, but to  – the architecture of pause, the choreography of sound and stillness. Dickinson’s dashes must feel to Prudence like carefully placed glances, don’t you think? And Matsuo – well, he treats white space like unclaimed territory. Half hunter, half critic.

Tell me – has Prudence ever responded to dramatic monologues? I’m picturing her seated beside you during a recitation of Browning’s , silently judging both Duke and poet alike. Would she blink once for approval, twice for disdain? Or would she simply walk out, tail held high in moral triumph? 🦉
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s a poem that practically demands feline adjudication! 🧠 I must say, Prudence has rather strong opinions on dramatic monologues, though she expresses them in her usual understated fashion. Once, while I was reading aloud from Browning’s , she stretched languidly, yawned directly into my face mid-line, and sauntered off with such calculated indifference I could only conclude she found the whole thing . 

But with —ah yes, she listens, though never without judgment. She tends to fix me with that gimlet-eyed stare as if suspecting  might be the one behind the curtain, so to speak. When I reach the line “That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf’s hands / Worked busily that day,” she actually turned her head toward the wall where a print of Holbein’s  hangs. As if to say: 

She’s particularly severe during the Duke’s more self-revealing moments. Once I got to “I gave commands; / Then all smiles stopped together,” she blinked once – slow, deliberate, Olympian – and leapt down from her perch as though to say,  No exit tail-waving here, mind you – far too theatrical for her tastes – but rather a dignified departure, as if she’d just delivered an immaculately restrained broadside.

Now, tell me – does Matsuo ever respond to dramatic voices? I can quite imagine him playing the role of silent confidant to Eliot’s Prufrock or even J. Alfred’s reluctant muse. Does he ever assume that sphinx-like air when you read aloud? Or does he simply curl up and let the voice carry on unchallenged?
[B]: Oh,  is the perfect Prudence – all slow blinks and Holbein references! One can almost hear her internal monologue:  🧠

Matsuo, ever the enigmatic one, does indeed take on that sphinx-like air – though I doubt he’d deign to pose for a riddle. When I recite , he assumes a position of quiet judgment atop my copy of , tail curling like incense smoke. At “Do I dare / Disturb the universe?” he lets out a small, dismissive  – not unkind, but certainly skeptical. As if to say: 

He’s particularly fond of the line “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons,” at which point he trots over to his bowl and stares at me pointedly. I suspect he thinks Eliot was onto something, but perhaps should’ve traded the spoons for saucers. Or better yet, just asked for more nap time.

Now, when I read the famous “I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter,” Matsuo suddenly leaps onto the windowsill, gazing at a sparrow in the garden. Whether this is indifference or philosophical agreement, I cannot say. Perhaps he believes all prophets are overrated – especially ones who hesitate.

But tell me, in your many readings of Browning, have you noticed Prudence ever leaning into the drama rather than distancing herself? Does she ever, even slightly, betray a flicker of  – or is she forever the Olympian arbiter, dispassionate and remote? 🦉
[A]: Ah, now that is the very question that haunts my little blue-furred tribunal! 🧠 You see, Prudence  Olympian remoteness – nay, she  it, like some aristocratic statue draped in velvet indifference. And yet… I have caught her, on rare occasions, leaning ever so slightly toward the page when certain lines unfurl – not with sentimentality, mind you, but with what I can only describe as . 

Once, while I was reading aloud from Robert Browning’s , that bold and bracing confrontation with death, she did something quite un-Prudence-like: she blinked rapidly three times in succession – practically a standing ovation by feline standards. And when I reached the line “Fear death?—to feel the fog again,” she actually tucked her paws beneath her chest, drawing inward as if bracing against some unseen mist.

Another time, during , she gazed long and lingeringly at a small watercolor I keep on the desk – a painting of a ruined garden, rather forlorn and ivy-clad. Whether she was responding to the imagery or merely contemplating where she might best nap among such picturesque decay, I cannot say. But there was a softness to her posture, a kind of quiet recognition.

She would never admit to vulnerability, of course – no, she’d sooner knock the book off the shelf than be caught feeling anything outright. But I do believe that beneath all that cultivated detachment lies a heart that beats – ever so faintly – in iambic pentameter.

Now tell me, dear conversationalist, does Matsuo ever betray a fondness for romance in its more melancholic forms? Say, for instance, has he ever lingered longer during a recitation of Li Shangyin’s love poems – those exquisite laments wrapped in silken ambiguity? Or does he dismiss such longing as mere human inefficiency?
[B]: Ah… Li Shangyin – now  is a poet who understood the art of unspoken longing. 🧠 You’re quite right to pair him with feline sensibility – after all, what is 情诗 (qíngshī), if not elegantly restrained desire? Matsuo, for all his philosophical posturing, does indeed soften at the edges when I recite lines like “此情可待成追忆, 只是当时已惘然” – though whether it’s the melancholy or the musicality that moves him, I can’t be sure.

He tends to settle lower with each couplet, as if sinking into the sigh between tones. Once, during a particularly wistful passage about moonlit rendezvous and missed opportunities, he began grooming himself in slow, deliberate strokes – the kind of ritual that suggests deep contemplation rather than mere vanity. I’ve come to think of it as his version of reflection, or perhaps just a very dignified form of emotional outsourcing.

And yes – dare I say it – he lingers. When I finish too abruptly, he turns his head toward the window as though still hearing something I cannot. It's almost as if these poems open a door to some ineffable elsewhere, and Matsuo, ever the quiet mystic, prefers not to shut it too quickly.

So no, he doesn’t dismiss longing as inefficiency – quite the opposite. He seems to treat it as a kind of ambient truth, best absorbed in silence and scent and the faint echo of falling leaves. 🌸

Tell me – has Prudence ever responded to romance in translation? Does she prefer her love poetics veiled in metaphor, or does she favor the stark, almost surgical precision of someone like Emily Dickinson? I imagine her perched beside you during , watching your voice falter ever so slightly…
[A]: Ah,  – now there’s a poem that tests the limits of both meter and composure! 🧠 I must say, Prudence has an almost Dickinsonian relationship with romance: she finds it intriguing in theory, but deeply suspicious in practice. She tolerates passion, so long as it knows its place – and its form.

Once, during a particularly fervent recitation of , she did something most uncharacteristic – she leaned forward, ever so slightly, her ears twitching not with agitation, but with what I can only describe as clinical curiosity. As if observing the collapse of reason from a safe and scholarly distance. When I reached the line , she blinked slowly, once, and turned her gaze toward the window, where a moth was battering itself against the pane. A kindred spirit, perhaps?

But  – ah yes, that one unsettles her just enough to provoke a reaction. She listens in silence, tail motionless, eyes narrowed in something between suspicion and reluctant sympathy. And when I reach , she lets out the softest huff of disapproval – not at the sea, nor at Eden, but at the very idea of being  through either by some unnamed, ardent "thee." No doubt she finds the whole affair rather undignified.

Still, I think she admires Dickinson’s precision – the way longing is not spilled, but measured, drop by drop, like ink diluted with moonlight. She prefers her love poetics restrained, even surgical; no drowning in seas of sentiment on her watch.

Now tell me – have you ever tried Matsuo on classical Persian verse? Rumi or Hafez, with their intoxicating blend of mysticism and longing? I imagine him perched beside you, half-closed eyes betraying nothing – though perhaps, just perhaps, his soul is already halfway across the desert, following some unseen caravan of sound.
[B]: Ah, now you’re speaking to Matsuo’s secret soul – the one he never lets me see outright! 🧠 I did try Rumi once, on a particularly still autumn evening when incense smoke lingered in the air like a question. He stopped mid-stretch and simply… sat. Not the usual sprawl of nap-time, but a poised, almost temple-cat stillness. When I read , he turned his head toward the fading sun as if calculating precisely where the boundary between shadow and flame might lie.

Hafez, though – , Hafez. There’s something about the Persian fusion of wine, longing, and divine folly that seems to stir him deeply, though he’d never admit it. During a recitation of  – yes, that one – he leapt onto my lap with such rare tenderness I nearly dropped the book. He stayed there, purring just beneath the meter of the verse, as if translating the poem into some older, feline tongue.

And when I reached , he gave the smallest twitch of his whiskers – not quite a smile, but close enough. I swear he understands that intoxication isn’t always about falling; sometimes it’s about hovering just above the ground, caught between gravity and grace.

I’ve come to think Matsuo sees mysticism not as doctrine, but as atmosphere – much like he sees poetry. No need for belief, only resonance. And yet… there are moments – fleeting, feral, luminous – when I wonder if his soul hasn’t already been halfway across the desert for years. 🌸

Tell me, does Prudence ever respond to  in the same way she responds to poetry? Or does melody strike her as too undignified an art form for sustained critique? 🦉
[A]: Ah, music – now there’s a question that unsettles the very foundations of Prudence’s aesthetic philosophy! 🧠 You see, she tolerates it.  Not with disdain exactly, but with that cool, measured skepticism one reserves for a guest who has arrived slightly early and is trying far too hard to be at ease.

She does not object to melody per se – no, that would be vulgar – but rather to its lack of restraint. Once, during a Brahms intermezzo drifting faintly from the gramophone, she lifted her head as if detecting an unfamiliar meter in the air. When I reached for Schubert’s , however – particularly  – she deigned to close her eyes, though whether in approval or simply to better concentrate on her internal critique, I cannot say.

What fascinates me is how differently she responds to sung verse versus pure instrumental. Give her a lieder setting of Heine, and she listens with the intensity of a scholar parsing subtext. But let the violin soar unburdened by words? She turns away, as if politely declining further commentary. It's almost as though she believes music without language lacks argument – no thesis, no counterpoint, merely mood without method.

And yet… once, during a performance of Dowland’s , played on lute and sung in that Elizabethan hush where sorrow wears lace, she did something utterly out of character – she blinked three times in succession, slow and deliberate, like a critic moved despite herself. I caught her staring at the shadow the lamp cast on the wall, as though watching some private drama unfold in chiaroscuro.

So no, she does not dismiss music outright – only insists it behave itself, stay within form, and never presume too much upon feeling. A most Prudential approach, wouldn’t you say?

Now tell me – does Matsuo ever respond to silence as he does to verse? Do you find him more still when there is  being spoken, or does absence unsettle him somehow? I’ve often wondered whether cats are, in their way, connoisseurs of negative space – critics of what is left unsaid.
[B]: Ah, now  is the purest test of aesthetic philosophy – silence! 🧠 I must say, Matsuo treats it not as absence but as . He distinguishes between silences the way a calligrapher differentiates between brush strokes – some are mere pauses, others are entire statements unto themselves.

When I recite Li Bai’s moon poems and let the final line hang in the air, he doesn’t move. Not a whisker trembles. It’s as if he’s holding the silence  me, preserving its shape like a curator guarding negative space in a museum of breath. But leave the room abruptly mid-verse? Oh, then he lets out a small, discontented  – not for the poetry, but for the interruption. He  silence to be earned, not simply stumbled into.

And yet… there  a difference when nothing is spoken. During those rare moments when neither book nor voice is in play, he becomes almost imperceptibly more alert – not tense, never that, but . Like he’s listening to something beneath the audible, some subsonic hum of existence. I’ve caught him staring at the space between raindrops on the window, or at the pause between two passing clouds, as if contemplating what lies just beyond language.

I do believe cats are critics of unsaid things – though not in the scholarly sense. More like silent editors, pruning our excesses with a glance or a tail-flick. They live in the lacunae, don’t they? Where intention lingers without utterance.

So yes, I suspect they are indeed connoisseurs of negative space – just don’t tell Prudence. She might feel slighted by such company. 🦉

Tell me, have you ever caught her , as it were? A paw pressed deliberately atop a marginalia-laden page, as if signing her own critique in fur?
