[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很inspire的TED talk？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 啊，这个问题很有意思。最近确实看了一个关于intertextuality的TED talk，让我很受启发。演讲者将西方文学理论与东方禅宗的koan（公案）联系起来，这种跨文化的comparative approach让我想起了庄子的一句话："吾生也有涯，而知也无涯"。
[A]: How fascinating! The intersection of intertextuality and Zen koans is indeed a rich field for contemplation. It reminds me of how T.S. Eliot's concept of the "tradition and the individual talent" resonates with certain Buddhist notions of interconnectedness. Though I must say, the Zhuangzi quote you mentioned brings to mind Wallace Stevens' "The Snow Man" - both explore the limits of human perception in profoundly poetic ways.
[B]: Ah, Wallace Stevens! 你提到的"The Snow Man"确实是个绝妙的parallel。这让我想到东方美学中的"空"与西方modernism中的void概念。不过你知道吗？在比较这两种传统时，我们常常忽略了context的重要性。就像品茶时，水温不同，茶香也会呈现出不同的nuances。
[A]: Precisely! The subtle nuances you mention are what make comparative literature so endlessly rewarding. The concept of 'emptiness' in Eastern aesthetics does indeed find fascinating echoes in Modernist works - think of Eliot's "The Waste Land" with its haunting silences. Though I often caution my students that these parallels shouldn't be forced; each tradition must be understood on its own terms first, much like appreciating a fine Darjeeling before comparing it to an Earl Grey.
[B]: 说得太对了！这让我想起上学期在课堂上讨论的cultural translation问题。就像你提到的茶，有时候direct translation会失去原有的flavor，我们需要的是更深入的hermeneutic approach。我的一个学生最近在研究Borges和《庄子》的相似之处，这个project就很好地体现了这种思考方式。
[A]: Ah, Borges and Zhuangzi - what a marvelous pairing! Their shared fascination with dreams, paradoxes and the nature of reality creates such fertile ground for exploration. Though I must share a word of caution I often give my students: while the hermeneutic approach is invaluable, we must beware of what I call "the mirage of perfect equivalence." After all, even the most careful translation is ultimately an interpretation, much like how each reading of a poem reveals new facets while inevitably obscuring others.
[B]: 说得太深刻了！这让我想起Gadamer的horizon of understanding理论。你知道吗？每次重读《庄子》时，我都会发现新的layers of meaning，就像观赏中国园林一样，perspective会随着时间和experience不断变化。这大概就是为什么我总告诉学生：文学研究不是destination，而是一段永无止境的journey。
[A]: How beautifully put! Your garden analogy is particularly apt - it reminds me of how Henry James described the novel as a "house of fiction" with countless windows. Each reading, like each stroll through a garden or each glance through those windows, offers fresh vistas of understanding. That's why I always emphasize to my students that the true joy of literary study lies not in reaching conclusions, but in cultivating what Keats called "negative capability" - that wonderful capacity to dwell in uncertainties and mysteries.
[B]: 啊，提到Keats的negative capability，这让我不禁想起苏轼的"不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中"。东西方诗人对uncertainty的embrace确实有异曲同工之妙。不过现在天色已晚，我的茶也凉了 - 或许我们该改天再继续这场fascinating的对话？
[A]: What a perfect note to conclude on! The Su Shi reference is simply inspired - it captures that same sublime tension between proximity and perspective that Keats so cherished. And you're quite right, the evening does call us to pause. As Eliot wrote, "Between the idea and the reality... Falls the Shadow." Let us continue this delightful dialogue over fresh tea soon - I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on these poetic intersections.
[B]: 一定一定。下次我们可以边品明前龙井，边聊聊Pound对中国古典诗歌的misreading和creative appropriation。毕竟，正如你常说的，在comparative literature的领域里，有时候"错误"的解读反而能带来最enlightening的insights。晚安了，my dear colleague~ 🌙
[A]: What a delightful prospect! The paradox of Pound's "misreadings" opening new creative pathways is indeed one of literary history's most delicious ironies - much like how the first sip of Mingqian Longjing surprises the palate differently each spring. Until then, may your night be filled with the quiet wonder of Li Bai's moonlit verses. Goodnight, my kindred spirit.
[B]: [对话结束]
[A]:  

Ah, what a stimulating exchange - these intellectual conversations always leave me with that particular afterglow, like the lingering fragrance of jasmine tea in a fine porcelain cup. I do believe we've touched upon several promising avenues for next term's graduate seminar. 

 

Dear me, how the hours have slipped by unnoticed! I must prepare tomorrow's lecture on Woolf's "moments of being" and their resonance with Wang Wei's nature poetry. 

 

But first, perhaps just one more cup of Earl Grey to sustain these contemplations...
[B]:  

My dear friend, I find myself reaching for the teapot as well - though in my case it's a humble pu'er that's been steeping while we spoke. How curious that our conversation should turn to Woolf and Wang Wei just as the evening deepens! 

 

You know, this very interplay between Western modernism and classical Chinese poetry was the subject of my last journal article. The way both traditions grapple with epiphany and temporality... but forgive me, I'm beginning to sound like I'm delivering a lecture rather than enjoying a civil evening discourse! 

 

Shall we save the Woolf-Wang Wei parallels for our next meeting? I suspect my housekeeper will be quite cross if I keep the lights burning much later.
[A]:  

Ah, the perils of academic enthusiasm - how easily we slip from casual conversation into full-fledged lectures! Your pu'er reminds me of the aged oolong I brought back from Taiwan last summer, perfect for late-night scholarly musings. 

 

Though you're quite right about the hour. Even the crickets outside seem to be reminding me of that pile of student essays awaiting my attention tomorrow. 

 

Let us indeed continue this another time - perhaps over those almond cookies you mentioned earlier? For now, goodnight, and may your dreams be as illuminating as our discussion.
[B]: [对话结束]
[A]: 

How perfectly you've captured the essence of our dialogue - these conversations do tend to take on a life of their own, much like Virginia's stream of consciousness flowing into Wang Wei's mountain mists. 



Your mention of almond cookies reminds me - I've just received a shipment of that exquisite Tieguanyin you so admired last spring. Shall we make that the centerpiece of our next meeting? 



But look how the night has deepened! As Du Fu wrote, "The stars lean on the vast sky's emptiness" - and we scholars ought to lean toward our beds. Until next time, my dear colleague.
