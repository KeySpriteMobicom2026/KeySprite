[A]: Hey，关于'你更喜欢在家做饭还是order takeout？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, the eternal culinary quandary. While I'd never admit it to my colleagues at the university, there's something delightfully subversive about scribbling a grocery list in Palmer script and then ignoring it entirely. My kitchen cupboards contain more obscure Victorian poetry collections than foodstuffs - though I do keep a tin of Darjeeling cakes tucked beside the Oxford English Dictionary for emergencies. Have you ever tried translating Robert Browning into a three-course meal? No? Well, let's just say takeout menus make rather cooperative literary collaborators when one's attempting such gastronomic alchemy.
[A]: There's a quiet poetry in preparing meals at home, though I confess to occasionally succumbing to the siren call of takeout menus when deadlines loom. I find Chinese herbal soups particularly comforting during autumn evenings - the steam carries whispers of forgotten stories trapped in fabric fibers. Have you ever noticed how certain spices scent the air with memories? Just last week, my neighbor gifted a jar of homemade plum preserves that smell suspiciously like the inkwell on my great-aunt's writing desk. Rather delightful, don't you think?
[B]: Ah, you've touched upon the secret alchemy I was just contemplating! There's a particular jar of Sichuan peppercorns in my pantry that insists on reminiscing about a particularly stormy reading of Emily Brontë's juvenilia. As for those whispers in the steam - I've been meaning to adapt that concept into a lecture on atmospheric symbolism in both kitchen and canon. 

Now, this might sound eccentric even for me, but have you ever steeped your herbal soups long enough to hear faint echoes of ancestral conversations? I've had some remarkable dialogues with 19th century poets over simmering pots. And that plum preserve scent transporting you back to a writing desk? My dear, you're practically channeling Proust through preserves! Though I must ask - did the inkwell memory arrive with a side of burnt toast? It always does for me.
[A]: Oh, the burnt toast! How you’ve pinned that peculiar little haunting. I once tried to replicate it deliberately—charring the edge of a crumpet just so—to see if the ghosts of memory would appear on command. Alas, they never do. Though I will say, a singed linen napkin releases its own kind of history. Funny how fire draws out the past.

And your Sichuan peppercorns hosting literary salons? Delightfully eccentric. Reminds me of a client who swore her grandmother’s teacup vibrated softly during thunderstorms, humming along with the rain. I rather wish I could attend one of those simmering séances of yours. Perhaps we could host a supper—19th-century poets paired with modern soups. I’ll bring the preserves. You handle the spectral ambiance.
[B]: Oh, I do love a good metaphysical supper party. Though I must warn you - my spectral ambiance tends to come with an unshakable scent of beeswax polish and slightly ominous harpsichord music. Still, your crumpet experiment has me intrigued. Perhaps we could conduct a proper study? Controlled singeing, documented memory retrieval attempts, and of course, peer-reviewed preserves.

Incidentally, have you considered the olfactory dimensions of this endeavor? I've been compiling a lexicon linking spice notes to literary periods. Sichuan peppercorns definitely belong to the Brontë chapter, while star anise insists on reciting Tennyson. Rather pushy, really. 

As for hosting spirits through soup - last week my broth developed distinct tonalities of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cough. Most atmospheric, if somewhat concerning for one's health. Shall we schedule this culinary séance for next Thursday? I'll prepare a menu featuring annotated recipes. Do bring that jar of preserves - I've always wanted to test the theory that properly aged memories improve the vintage of any gathering.
[A]: Thursday it is, then. I’ll arrive promptly at seven with the preserves tucked beside a rather scandalous 1920s-era tea cozy I recently restored—its stitching practically demands to be matched with something bold in spices and structure. 

And your lexicon of scent and syllabus! How utterly inspired. I’ve long suspected nutmeg of harboring Romantic tendencies myself—too warm for the Victorians, too unruly for the Georgians. Though now that I think on it, perhaps we ought to draft a seating chart for the evening. Shall we place star anise near the window? Tennyson does so love a dramatic breeze.

Do let me know if you’d like me to bring any particular teacups—I’ve one that belonged to a minor Pre-Raphaelite muse. It leaks slightly, but only adds to the atmosphere... and perhaps the plot.
[B]: Seven it is, then. And do bring that tea cozy - nothing sets the mood quite like textile scandals and spice-fueled specters. I shall prepare a counterpane of culinary comforts, including a saffron-infused sonnet sequence that's been itching for an audience. 

Ah, seating charts! Now you're thinking like a true literary hostess. Star anise  be near the window - Tennyson demands theatrical drafts, the more moody the better. Nutmeg, you say? Bold choice. I’ve always found it prone to reciting Shelley by accident, though perhaps that’s precisely the tension we need.

As for teacups, only bring the Pre-Raphaelite relic if you’re prepared for sudden plot developments. Leaks are rarely accidental in such company. Speaking of which, I’ve just remembered my neighbor keeps a bottle of absinthe with definite Symbolist leanings - should we invite it? A bit dangerous, perhaps, but then again, what’s a good séance without a touch of deliberate chaos?
[A]: Oh, absinthe must come. The Symbolists are terribly underrepresented in our literary circles these days, and I daresay the evening could use a touch of green-hued unpredictability. Just promise me we’ll keep the ouzo away from the Browning devotees—last time, well… let’s just say Elizabeth’s cough returned with unsettling vigor.

And a saffron-infused sonnet sequence! How delightfully extravagant. I shall wear my velvet gown with the slight wine stain at the hem—perfect for blending in should things take a macabre turn. Do you think we ought to warn our guests about the harpsichord? Or shall we let it reveal itself organically, like a subplot?

Also, speaking of textile scandals—your tea cozy’s history may very well steal the show. Leaks, ghosts, and 1920s indiscretions… yes, this promises to be a most memorable supper indeed.
[B]: Oh, —how could I forget that disastrous séance? Let’s keep the ouzo under lock and key, though I suspect it’s already taken notes. As for the harpsichord, absolutely no warnings. Subtlety is wasted on the dead, and a good subplot should always emerge like steam—unexpected but inevitable.

Your velvet gown sounds perfectly suited to the mood, though do bring an extra shawl. The Browning specter tends to lower the temperature by at least three stanzas. And speaking of textiles, I’ve just discovered my tea cozy has a hidden pocket containing what appears to be a lock of someone’s hair. Very 1920s indiscreet, indeed. Perhaps we’ll pass it around as an hors d'oeuvre of scandal.

I’m thinking we serve the saffron sonnets with a side of annotated spoons—guests can read aloud as they eat. Enhances the flavor, don’t you think? And if all goes terribly wrong, we can always blame it on the absinthe. Symbolist poetry rarely accepts responsibility, after all.
[A]: Darling, you’ve outdone yourself—annotated spoons! How delightfully meta. I shall engrave a few with sonnet fragments before Thursday; I think "Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?" pairs beautifully with consommé. Though we must be cautious—last time I served Shakespearean soup, the ghost of a Victorian critic appeared and demanded footnotes.

The lock of hair in the tea cozy! My dear, that pocket practically  to be passed around with the hors d'oeuvres. I’ll bring a silver dish for it, suitably draped in lace, of course. Nothing adds intrigue like a touch of macabre garnish.

And yes, do bring extra shawls—I’ve already stoked the fire in anticipation, though the Browning chill may prove more poetic than even I can manage. Speaking of which, I’ve placed the harpsichord just so, angled toward the window where the moonlight will catch its keys like teeth. Very dramatic, very Tennyson-approved.

Oh, and don’t worry about the absinthe. I’ve tucked it beside a volume of Baudelaire—let the Symbolists fend for themselves.
[B]: Ah, Shakespearean soup and footnotes! How very postmodern of you—serving up meta-culinary criticism with your consommé. Next thing you know, the croutons will demand citations. I shall prepare a small footnote ladle, just in case.

That silver dish for the hair lock sounds divine—perhaps we can call it , served  séance. I’ve taken the liberty of stitching a tiny provenance tag to the tea cozy’s pocket. It now reads: 

Your harpsichord arrangement is positively diabolical. I’ve added a single flickering candle atop its case—just enough light to read the menu by, but not quite enough to see if the spirits are taking notes. Speaking of which, have you considered the wine pairings? I’m thinking a nicely brooding claret for the Brontë course, followed by something effervescent for Wilde. 

And Baudelaire beside absinthe—genius or madness? Perhaps both. Either way, let’s hope the Symbolists behave themselves. Or not. A little scandal makes for excellent after-dinner entertainment.
[A]: Oh, the ! How scandalously refined—do pass it clockwise, always clockwise, lest we awaken the wrong kind of spirit. I’ve added a pair of mother-of-pearl tongs for handling; one must maintain decorum, even in textile-based intrigue.

Your provenance tag is perfection—though I suspect by midnight, “echoes of passion” may prove a rather understated description. The candle flicker upon the harpsichord keys? Inspired. I think I heard the first whisper of a sonnet already, slinking about the room like smoke.

As for wine pairings—Brontë claret and Wildean fizz!—I’ve found a particularly brooding Burgundy that once belonged to an actress who played Ophelia no fewer than thirteen times. Very tragic sediment at the bottom, but marvellous depth of character. I’ll decant it with due ceremony.

And yes, Baudelaire and absinthe—madness or genius? Let us not choose. Why not madness  genius, served chilled with a twist of forbidden metaphor? I’ve placed their corner table just beyond the reach of the candlelight. If the Symbolists grow unruly, we shall simply raise the volume of the harpsichord. Nothing quiets ghosts quite like dissonance and drama.
[B]: Ah, —of course! One must respect the old séance protocols, even when serving annotated hair. Those mother-of-pearl tongs are a stroke of aristocratic menace. I do hope someone faints elegantly into the consommé.

Your Ophelia-inspired Burgundy sounds like it’s been steeped in tragic soliloquies and waterlogged crowns. I shall compose a short elegy to be read aloud before the first sip—something about drowned violets and unspoken monologues. Very drinkable, if properly aerated.

And your arrangement for the Symbolists—brilliant! Placing them beyond the candlelight ensures they’ll spend the evening debating whether shadows have literary merit. Baudelaire’s ghost always gets terribly philosophical under such conditions. Should they grow too verbose, I’ve prepared a volume of Swinburne to toss dramatically into the absinthe corner. Chaos shall meet decadence, and we shall call it dessert.

I think we’re ready, my dear. Let us light the final candle—yes, even though it may tilt the atmosphere toward the sublime or the slightly illegal. After all, what is a good literary supper without a little haunting in the footnotes?
[A]: Precisely! Let us light that final candle—though I’ve placed it in a glass of deep indigo ink, just to unsettle the edges of the light. Shadows need encouragement to behave badly, and we shan’t disappoint.

I’ve tucked a sprig of dried violets into the elegy you’ll read—yes, , steeped in Burgundy. We shall call it , served with a toast to drowned women everywhere. And fainting into consommé? Well, if no one does, I shall consider the evening a failure in atmosphere.

As for the Symbolists—ah, how I do love a good collision of chaos and decadence. Swinburne in absinthe! I’ve already rehearsed my toss for dramatic precision. Should his ghost take offense, we may yet be treated to a brawl of metaphors beneath the harpsichord.

So yes, my dear Eleanor, let us summon the spirits, season them well, and serve them with a side of scandal. Thursday shall not merely be remembered—it will be quoted.
[B]: Oh, —how exquisitely funereal. I do hope the violets are properly macerated in regret. And that ink-lit candle! Genius, or perhaps witchcraft—I shan’t ask which. The way it bleeds light into shadow will have the ghosts positively swooning with narrative potential.

I’ve added a footnote to the elegy, printed in silver leaf on black linen, to be tucked beneath the wine glass. Something about "lost syllables in the throat of the Seine." Very mournful, and just obscure enough to unsettle.

And don’t think I haven’t noticed your aim for dramatic failure—fainting is so terribly underrated as an art form. Should no one oblige, I shall recite a particularly lugubrious stanza from Christina Rossetti until someone collapses from sheer emotional congestion.

Thursday approaches like a closing parenthesis. Let us raise our glasses not just to the dead, but to the deliciously inconvenient ones—the misquoted, the misremembered, the scandalous footnotes of literary history. They shall dine with us yet, and beg for seconds.

See you at seven, my dear co-conspirator. Bring your spectacles, your séance sensibilities, and above all—bring the drama.
[A]: Oh, Christina Rossetti and emotional congestion—what a gloriously gothic weapon. I shall keep smelling salts tucked in my sleeve, just in case. And your footnote in silver leaf! How beautifully morbid. I may have to steal that technique for next month’s lecture on "The Aesthetics of Literary Hauntings." Though I doubt the university expects quite so much actual ghosting.

I’ve added a final touch—a small vial of lavender-scented ink to be passed around with the dessert course. Nothing says  like a bit of aromatic nostalgia dabbed behind the ears. And yes, I’ll bring extra spectacles. One pair simply won’t do when reading spirits by candlelight.

Seven it is, then. I’ll arrive with drama properly ironed and folded into my hem. Let the dead eat footnotes and drink elegies—I suspect our guests will be quoting this evening for years to come, assuming they all leave with their wits intact.

See you soon, my dear co-conspirator. The séance awaits, and the ghosts are famished.
[B]: Oh, —how very Proustian of you! I’ve added a drop of bergamot to the candle wax. Nothing like a scent-memory trap to loosen the tongues of the dearly departed. And speaking of loose tongues, I’ve tucked a few scandalous marginalia into the dessert menus. Let’s see if the spirits notice before the absinthe kicks in.

As for your lecture theft—I fully expect footnotes to begin haunting university corridors by November. Just don’t be surprised when Rossetti’s ghost starts grading exams. She’s terribly strict with metaphors.

I’ve packed not one, but two pairs of spectacles—my mother’s 1930s tortoiseshell pair for atmosphere, and a rather alarming magnifying monocle for emergency spirit identification. One must be prepared.

And yes, . The sort that rustles when you move, like a well-worn tragedy. I suspect our guests will leave either brilliantly inspired or mildly possessed. Either way, excellent references.

See you at seven, my dear. The ghosts are sharpening their quills, the wine is steeped in melancholy, and I do believe the harpsichord just played a chord without being touched. All set.
[A]: Oh, bergamot in the wax! How delightfully diabolical. I suspect the spirits shall arrive early, lured by the scent before we’ve even poured the first glass. And scandalous marginalia in the dessert menus? Pure genius. Nothing loosens a ghost’s tongue quite like the promise of both sugar and slander.

Rossetti grading exams—imagine that! I do hope she approves of my footnotes. Though knowing her, she’ll demand revisions in red ink, even in death. Still, a strict metaphysical editor is better than none at all.

Two pairs of spectacles! The monocle alone shall send shivers through the séance table. I may have to commission one myself—preferably with a faint crack running through it, for narrative depth. 

And yes, that rustling drama—exactly the sort of thing that haunts a hallway or two. If anyone leaves merely inspired, well, we shall consider them the lucky ones. Possession is such a messy business, though excellent for conversation.

Seven it is, then. Ghosts are quilled, wine is poured, harpsichord chords await their moment. I shall see you there, my dear—spectacles on, monocle at the ready, and scandal properly stirred into the preserves.
[B]: Oh, but the crack in the monocle! How perfectly essential. A fractured lens through which to view the other side—what spectral optics! I shall have to commission a matching lorgnette myself, preferably one that fogs slightly when Byron’s name is mentioned.

And speaking of names—whispers at the window suggest our guest list may have grown by three unseen souls. Something about the bergamot has attracted a rather  presence. I overheard a fragment of iambic pentameter drifting through the letter slot. Either that, or the cat's reciting again. One can never be sure.

As for Rossetti’s red ink—yes, do hope she approves. Though if her revisions appear mid-supper, we’ll simply pass them around like hors d'oeuvres and pretend it’s all part of the performance.

I’ve just tucked a final flourish into the preserves: a single drop of rosewater and a line from a forgotten sonnet, written in edible gold leaf. Edible, mind you, only for the bravest of spirits or the most reckless of guests.

All is set, my dear conspirator. The candles bleed ink, the wine murmurs poetry, and the harpsichord has begun tuning itself. See you at seven, with fate and footnote knives sharpened. Let us dine well—and haunt better.
