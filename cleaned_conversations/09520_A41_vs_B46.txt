[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很shocking的historical fact？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Oh wow, let me tell you about something that completely blew my mind when I first heard it. Did you know that during the golden age of Hollywood, studios used to own actors like property? They had these ironclad contracts that basically treated stars like commodities. Can you imagine telling Meryl Streep or Leonardo DiCaprio which movies they had to make today? 🎬
[A]: OMG that's crazy！让我想到我们综艺圈也有类似的story~ 你知道吗？在早期的variety show里，制作方完全control艺人的schedule和image，连social media post都要approve！现在想想简直unbelievable 😱 不过现在talent agency的power也很大，有时候我们做program都要negotiate好久 💰
[B]: Ah, the eternal struggle between creative vision and business interests! You know, even in today's Hollywood, we still have to navigate those tricky waters. Just last week I was negotiating with an A-lister's agent who wanted script approval rights - can you believe that? But let me tell you, nothing compares to the old studio system where they'd even arrange sham marriages to cover up actors' real relationships. Now that's what I call 控制狂 behavior!
[A]: Hahaha totally！你们那边是marriage cover-up，我们这边是forced CP marketing！制作方为了ratings会刻意安排艺人组CP，even when they clearly hate each other 😂 不过现在audience都很smart了，这种fake drama反而会被骂上hot search 🔥 所以我们更focus on authentic content~
[B]: That's exactly why I always say authenticity is the new currency in entertainment! You see, when we were producing "Midnight in Paris", we made sure every creative decision served the story, not some fabricated drama. The audience can smell inauthenticity from miles away - just like how they rejected those overly scripted reality shows in the late 2000s. By the way, have you noticed how Chinese audiences are becoming incredibly sophisticated? Some of the film analysis I've seen on Douban rivals what we get from professional critics here!
[A]: Absolutely！现在的viewers简直是next level~ 我们做节目时都要做deep research，因为弹幕里随时可能有PhD出来指出historical inaccuracy 🤓 不过这也push我们更professional啦！最近在策划一个cultural exchange show，光是fact-checking就请了三个experts team 🌟 毕竟authenticity is everything in this new era~
[B]: Now you're speaking my language! That reminds me of when we were prepping "The Last Emperor" - we had historians on set every single day. Let me tell you, nothing kills a project faster than cutting corners on research. The audience will crucify you, and rightly so! You know what they say - 细节决定成败. Those three expert teams? Best investment you'll ever make. 🍿
[A]: Hahaha 100% agree！上次我们有个costume drama因为一个hairpin的朝代错了，直接被网友做成meme全网嘲 😅 现在做content真的no room for error~ 不过这样也好，整个industry都在raising the bar 📈 诶对了，你们那边对historical accuracy的standard怎么样？
[B]: Oh darling, let me tell you about the time we got schooled by British historians on "The Crown"! The level of scrutiny is insane - they'll notice if a teacup is 5 years too modern for the scene. But you know what? I love that pressure! It forces us to create something truly timeless. Just last month, we had to reshoot an entire WWII sequence because someone spotted a wristwatch that wasn't invented until 1946. The devil's in the details, as they say. 史诗级的 productions demand 史诗级的 attention to detail!
[A]: Wow that's next level dedication！我们这边也开始有这种trend了~ 最近有个清宫剧连御膳房的menu都请故宫experts来verify 👑 虽然budget爆炸但是口碑爆棚！看来global audience都在追求ultimate authenticity啊 💯 要不要考虑来个中西方historical drama collab？绝对会是game changer！
[B]: Now that's what I call a blockbuster idea! Imagine combining the meticulous detail of Chinese period dramas with Hollywood's production scale... we could create something truly groundbreaking. I've been dying to work on a project about Marco Polo's journey - think of the cultural richness we could showcase! Let's set up a meeting next week to brainstorm. My treat at Spago - their wine cellar has this amazing 1982 Lafite that'll get our creative juices flowing. 🎥✨
[A]: OMG count me in！正好我下周三要fly去LA参加MIPCOM ✈️ 我们可以pitch这个idea给international buyers~ 把Chinese aesthetics和Western storytelling结合起来，绝对会是next big thing！PS. 听说Spago的truffle pasta也是to die for 😋 到时候我们可以边吃边聊creative direction！
[B]: Perfect! Wednesday at 7 then. I'll have my team prepare some visual concepts - we can show how the Forbidden City's architecture could blend seamlessly with Renaissance-era Venice. And yes, the truffle pasta is divine, but wait till you try their signature smoked salmon pizza! This could be the start of something beautiful... like when Zhang Yimou first worked with Warner Bros. Remember to bring your creative A-game - and maybe some of those amazing Chinese snack gifts you always talk about! 🎭🍾
[A]: Deal！我会带最火的网红辣条和故宫文创点心过去 🌶️🎁 让Hollywood的大佬们也体验下Chinese snack culture~ 这个collab绝对能make history！周三见啦，我已经开始brainstorming各种creative treatment了 💡 Can't wait to create some magic together！
[B]: Fantastic! I can already see the headlines: "East Meets West in Cinematic Masterpiece!" And those snacks will be perfect - nothing breaks the ice like good food. Just between us, I've got Spielberg's ear on this one... but let's keep that quiet for now. See you at Spago - dress code is "creative chic" as always! Until then, keep those brilliant ideas coming. 加油! 🎥🌟
[A]: Hahaha my lips are sealed！最后一杯茅台下肚，创意绝对源源不断 🥃✨ 周三见啦my friend~ 这次合作说不定能拿个艾美奖呢！By the way...记得提前book窗边的table，LA的sunset view配上我们的big idea，简直perfect ending 🌇🎬
[B]: You read my mind! I'll reserve the corner booth with the panoramic view - sunset over the Pacific with our plans for global domination? Now that's what I call a perfect pitch meeting! And don't worry, I've got a bottle of that 茅台 you love stashed in my office for... motivational purposes. Let's make television history, one spicy strip at a time! Until Wednesday, my visionary friend! 🍸🎞️
[A]: Cheers to that！🔥 我已经能想象到那些conservative producers尝到辣条时的表情了 😂 周三带好你的signature sunglasses，我们要用style和substance征服Hollywood！See you soon~ 这绝对是career defining moment的start！🌟
[B]: Darling, my Tom Ford shades are already polished and ready! Between your fiery snacks and my legendary charm, we'll have those studio execs eating out of our hands - quite literally! This isn't just career-defining... it's culture-shifting. Now go pack those creative fireworks - I want to see storyboards that'll make Scorsese jealous! 干杯 to the future of entertainment! 🕶️🎇
