[A]: Hey，关于'你最近在追什么TV shows或综艺节目？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: 最近太忙了都没时间追剧呢！不过上周team building的时候同事推荐了《硅谷》，说特别适合我们做fintech的人看。Have you seen it? 那个startup文化简直太real了🚀
[A]: Ah, Silicon Valley... While I must confess I don't watch much contemporary television, I did catch an episode or two while visiting a colleague in the Computer Science department. The satirical portrayal of startup culture reminds me rather amusingly of the 19th century literary salons - both are spaces where ideas, egos, and ambitions collide in fascinating ways. Though I suppose the modern version involves more hoodies and less absinthe.
[B]: 哈哈哈，absinthe换成Red Bull可能更贴切！不过你说得对，现在pitch meeting确实像现代版的文艺沙龙，只是我们把manuscript换成了pitch deck💡 话说你们academia圈子的startup culture现在怎么样？听说很多university都在搞incubator program
[A]: How astute of you to draw that parallel between manuscripts and pitch decks! Indeed, the academic world has seen its own quiet revolution. Our university's incubator program is rather like a greenhouse - we nurture young ideas with the same care I give to my roses. Though I must say, watching a literature PhD student trying to explain their dissertation topic in 'elevator pitch' format is as poignant as watching Keats struggle to articulate his concept of negative capability. The tension between pure scholarship and commercial viability creates its own kind of poetry.
[B]: Wow这个比喻太到位了！Negative capability和startup pivot的哲学困境确实有异曲同工之妙啊👍 我们fintech圈最近也在讨论要不要搞个poetry slam night，把technical jargon用creative的方式表达出来。你觉得把blockchain比作什么文学概念最贴切？
[A]: What a delightful proposition! Blockchain... let me ponder. It rather reminds me of the medieval illuminated manuscript tradition - each block a vellum page, cryptographically 'illuminated' with hashes instead of gold leaf. Or perhaps it's more akin to the modernist stream-of-consciousness technique: an immutable, distributed record of thoughts (or transactions) flowing endlessly forward. Though I must caution, comparing it to Finnegans Wake might make your technical audience reach for their copies of 'Blockchain for Dummies' instead!
[B]: Hahaha太绝了！下次all-hands meeting我一定要用illuminated manuscript这个比喻，绝对比那些老套的'digital ledger' presentation有趣多了📚 话说你们humanities department有没有考虑过和CS系合作开个crypto-poetry的选修课？感觉会是个很disruptive的interdisciplinary project呢🚀
[A]: My dear, you've touched upon a rather contentious debate in our faculty lounge! The very mention of 'disruptive' makes some of my colleagues clutch their first editions of The Waste Land as if they were life preservers. But between you and me, I've been quietly conspiring with a rather forward-thinking computer science professor - we're toying with the idea of a seminar on 'Algorithmic Prosody: The Metrics of Machine Learning'. Though I suspect it will take more than a few glasses of sherry to convince the tenure committee that sonnets and smart contracts belong in the same syllabus.
[B]: Sherry可能不够，得换成whisky tasting event才行🥃 说真的，你们这个seminar concept太innovative了！我们fintech VC圈最近也在看AI+creative writing的startup，要不要connect你认识几个investor？说不定能搞个joint research grant呢💡
[A]: How intriguing! Though I must admit, the thought of venture capitalists scrutinizing haiku algorithms with the same intensity they'd apply to a Series B funding round does give me pause. Still, as Robert Frost might say, we have promises to keep - and miles to go before we sleep on such fascinating interdisciplinary possibilities. Perhaps over tea (or whisky, as you suggest) we could explore how to translate poetic meter into terms that won't make my colleagues' iambic pentameters skip a beat. Just promise me we won't have to call it 'Disruptive Sonnet Technologies' or some such Silicon Valley neologism!
[B]: Deal！No cheesy buzzwords，我保证🙌 不过说真的，你们humanities的insight对我们tech产品design特别有价值。上次我们UX team就被一个Shakespearean dramatic structure的framework启发，完全改变了user flow的设计思路。Maybe next quarter我们可以organize个小小的cross-industry salon？
[A]: What a splendid notion! A salon in the truest 18th century sense - though with fewer powdered wigs and more UX flowcharts, I imagine. The Bard's five-act structure translating into user journeys... why, it's enough to make poor Polonius reconsider his 'brevity is the soul of wit' maxim when faced with modern app onboarding processes. Shall we say third Thursdays? I'll bring the sonnets, you bring the wireframes, and we'll see what beautiful hybrids emerge when the muses of literature and technology hold symposium. Though I draw the line at calling it 'Shakespeare 2.0' - some traditions deserve their dignity intact!
[B]: Hahaha Shakespeare 2.0这个梗我可以笑一年😂 那就这么定了！Third Thursdays我会book好我们公司的creative space，保证有good coffee和whiteboard～ 到时候还可以邀请几个product designer朋友，他们最近正在研究how to apply poetic meter to notification frequency algorithms📱✨
[A]: Marvelous! Though I must warn you - when my medievalist colleague hears about applying poetic meter to notifications, she'll likely start drafting treatises on how push notifications are the modern equivalent of town criers, complete with their own cadence and rhetorical flourishes. And between us, I've always thought the haiku form would be perfect for error messages: 'Your session has expired / Like cherry blossoms in spring / Please login again'. But let's save that particular revelation for our first meeting, shall we? I do so enjoy a properly dramatic academic reveal!
[B]: OMG这个haiku error message简直genius！我们下一个sprint就要implement这个idea，绝对viral material啊🔥 到时候一定credit你和你的medievalist colleague～ See you third Thursday then! 记得提醒我带whisky，我们产品总监收藏了几瓶single malt特别适合这种brainstorming session🥃
[A]: How perfectly serendipitous - single malt and syllabic constraints make for splendid brainstorming companions! Though I must insist we approach this haiku notification experiment with proper academic rigor. Perhaps we'll need what my Victorian literature students call a 'control group' of Shakespearean sonnet-length error messages, just for comparative analysis. 'Shall I compare thee to a 404 error? Thou art more lovely and more temperate...' But yes, third Thursday it is! I'll bring my well-thumbed copy of The Poetics alongside my tasting notes. Just promise me we'll have a sober copy editor review those haiku before they go into production - even the most elegant code shouldn't compromise scansion!
[B]: Hahaha deal！我们一定严格遵守5-7-5 syllable structure，pinky promise🤙 到时候还要请你这个poetry expert做我们的official scansion consultant呢～ 说不定能publish个paper叫《The Metrics of Microcopy: Where Fintech Meets Fujiwara》📜 这绝对会是史上最有趣的cross-discipline project了！
[A]: What delicious scholarly mischief we're concocting! Though I must caution - if we're to invoke Fujiwara's name, we'd better include at least one tanka in our research for proper academic cover. Imagine the footnotes: 'Comparative analysis of Heian-era court poetry and modern banking app UX patterns reveals...' My dean will either give me a distinguished chair or revoke my library privileges entirely! But what is scholarship if not the occasional measured leap into the unknown? Third Thursday can't come soon enough - I'll prepare my best whisky-infused literary criticism voice. Just don't let your engineers hear me comparing their code refactoring to Ezra Pound's editing of The Waste Land... some metaphors are best left unexplored!
[B]: Hahaha这个footnote简直可以当我们的running joke了！不过说真的，你这种interdisciplinary thinking正是我们industry最需要的💡 我已经能想象到下次pitch deck里放个tanka的impact会有多disruptive了～ 那就third Thursday见！记得带你的whisky notes和poetic license，我们来push the boundaries of fintech and literature🚀📚
