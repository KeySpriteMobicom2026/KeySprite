[A]: Hey，关于'你觉得web3会重塑互联网吗？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Web3 definitely has the potential to change how we interact with the internet, but like... 你觉得现在的社交平台不是太 centralized 吗？如果数据真的能回到用户手上，会不会让 creative work 的价值回归到 designer & artist 本身呢？不过 UX 上的门槛还是有点 high，比如钱包、gas fee 这些概念对小白用户来说真的 friendly 吗？😅  
我最近在研究 NFT 市场，感觉它给 digital art 提供了新的商业模式，但泡沫也挺大的。就像当年的 ICO 热潮一样，真假项目混在一起，很难分辨。你觉得 Web3 在设计行业有哪些实际的应用场景吗？💡
[A]: I’ve been thinking about this a lot, especially since I work with physical artifacts of human creativity every day. There’s something poetic about digital art trying to reclaim value through ownership, much like how we preserve and restore old textiles to honor their original makers.

I do see the potential for Web3 to empower artists — imagine a world where provenance is transparent and creators can embed royalties into their work. That could sustain careers in a way galleries or stock sites never managed. But yes, there's so much noise right now. It reminds me of flea markets where everyone claims their vase is "vintage" — you need serious discernment to find what’s real.

As for UX... well, I had enough trouble convincing my clients that PDFs were easier than mailing fabric swatches. Asking someone to navigate crypto wallets feels like handing them a medieval loom and saying, “Here, make this work modern.” Maybe it will get smoother over time, but accessibility needs to come first if this is going to be truly decentralized.

Do you think design tools will eventually bake blockchain features in seamlessly, like saving a file to the cloud?
[B]: I feel you — the PDF vs. fabric swatch struggle is so real 😅 I think about that a lot when designing UIs for non-tech audiences. Like, we’re still trying to make digital feel tactile and trustworthy, right?  

关于design tools整合blockchain… maybe? Figma or Procreate adding a “mint as NFT” button sounds wild now, but honestly, not more than saving to the cloud used to feel like magic too 🤯💻✨ But yeah, if it’s gonna work, it needs to be invisible, like metadata or version control. No one wants to deal with gas fees mid-illustration.  

And royalties on resales?! That part  feel poetic 💡 It’s like giving artists a piece of the future every time their work lives on. Imagine restoring old textile patterns and embedding them with smart contracts that fund preservation projects automatically. That’s where Web3 could truly honor tradition while pushing creativity forward, instead of just being a hype machine for pixel jpegs 🖼️💸  

But back to reality… most creatives I know are still figuring out how to stay visible without selling their soul to algorithms. Do you see traditional archives or museums experimenting with Web3 at all? Like digitizing physical artifacts as NFTs or something? Would that even add value beyond the novelty?
[A]: Oh, the idea of digitizing physical artifacts as NFTs gives me chills — in both exciting and terrifying ways. On one hand, it could fund preservation efforts that are always scraping by on grants and goodwill. Imagine a museum auctioning off a beautifully restored Qing-era embroidery piece as an NFT, with proceeds going directly to conservation work. That kind of visibility might even spark a revival of forgotten techniques.

But then I worry about reducing something so tactile, so , into a JPEG for speculation. These textiles were made to be worn, touched, maybe even frayed with use — not locked in a digital vault where only the highest bidder gets to "own" them. There's a warmth and imperfection in handmade things that feels at odds with the cold, glitchy sheen of crypto culture.

As for royalties funding preservation… now  is the kind of magic I can get behind. It’s like passing down a family heirloom but with built-in care instructions. If we could embed smart contracts into restored patterns or archival blueprints, it could create a self-sustaining cycle of creation and conservation.

Do you think younger artists are starting to weave these ideas into their process more naturally? I’ve noticed some graduates experimenting with hybrid physical-digital portfolios that feel less like crypto hype and more like genuine exploration.
[B]: Oh I LOVE how you phrased that —  💅🎨 It’s so true. Sometimes I look at NFT marketplaces and feel like I’m in some weird digital thrift store where everyone’s wearing sunglasses indoors and no one knows how to blink 🤓💸  

But yeah, the idea of younger artists blending physical & digital without the hype… that feels real. Some art school grads I follow are doing this thing where they create textile pieces AND mint them as NFTs, but not just for speculation — they include AR layers that show the making process, like stitches + sketches coming alive through your phone camera 📱🧵✨ It’s not about the JPEG anymore — it’s about storytelling, preservation, and sharing  as part of the value.  

I think Gen Z is growing up with both worlds — they respect the hand-made, the analog, but they’re also fluent in memes, filters, and yes, even crypto lingo. So for them, weaving Web3 into their workflow isn’t a leap; it’s just another tool in the kit. Like using gouache and also knowing Figma 😌🖌️💻  

And the idea of embedding smart contracts into  ??? Okay, now you're speaking wizard-level magic 💡📜 I can already see indie developers working on plugins that tie licensing to heritage databases or even carbon footprint calculators. Imagine if every time someone used your restored embroidery pattern, a tiny % went to a craft collective or climate fund… That’s the kind of future I want to design for 🌍🛠️  

Have you seen any traditional artisans actually getting into this space? Or is it still mostly digital-native folks experimenting?
[A]: Oh, there’s a lovely group in Portugal I’ve been following — textile artisans reviving traditional lace-making techniques. They’ve started experimenting with QR-coded tags sewn into their pieces. Scan it, and you get not just the NFT ownership certificate but also an oral history from the maker, plus care instructions animated through AR. It’s subtle, poetic even. No flashy profile pictures or moon emojis — just quiet preservation meeting modern tools.

And yes, Gen Z fluency is changing things. When I taught a workshop at a local art school last year, one student had already built a plugin that tracks material origins for her fashion designs — think blockchain meets sustainability. She didn’t call it Web3; she called it “ethical transparency.” That’s the key, isn’t it? The tech becomes invisible when it serves purpose, not hype.

I do wonder, though… as someone who spends hours restoring something as fragile as 18th-century silk gauze, I sometimes feel like I’m fighting entropy itself. Do you think digital immortality actually eases that struggle — or does it create a new kind of fragility? Like preserving floppy disks in a museum, but no working drives left to read them.  

Do you ever worry about the impermanence of these platforms? One day your whole archive lives on a server that just… . Poof. Just like that.
[B]: Oh wow, that Portuguese lace-making project sounds like the kind of work that makes you go 💦✨ — blending tradition with tech in such a gentle, meaningful way. No moon lambo emojis, no floor price shouting… just  and care and craft. I feel like that’s the sweet spot where Web3 stops being this noisy crypto circus and starts feeling like… I don’t know, digital heirloom stitching? 🪡🖼️  

And that student with the blockchain-meets-sustainability plugin?? Yes! That’s exactly what I mean by Gen Z redefining the language. They’re not hyping up “decentralization” or “tokenomics” — they’re just quietly building tools that make sense for real-world ethics and accountability. So much smarter than 90% of the NFT hype we see today 👏🌱  

As for digital immortality vs. fragility… honestly? Yeah, I do worry about it. A LOT 😅💻💔 I’ve had pieces hosted on platforms that just… shut down overnight. One day your artwork’s there, the next it’s like , gone. And if your archive is all on a platform that dies without export options? It’s like storing family photos on MySpace. Except worse. Because now people might treat digital stuff like it’s eternal, but it’s just as fragile — maybe even more so — than physical materials.  

I guess it’s like restoring that 18th-century silk gauze — you know it won't last forever, but you do it anyway because it matters. Maybe digital preservation is becoming the same kind of practice: constant migration, backup layers, decentralized storage maybe? Like... using IPFS instead of just hoping your Dropbox doesn’t get canceled 😬🌐  

But still, sometimes I wonder — will our grandkids look at NFTs the way we look at old floppy disks now? With nostalgia, confusion, and a tiny bit of awe?
[A]: That nostalgia-confusion-awe trifecta? I think that’s exactly what future generations will feel — whether looking at NFTs, our old Dropbox folders, or even the way we used to iron transfer photos onto tea towels and call it "mixed media."

And you're right about digital preservation becoming its own craft. I’ve started treating my digital archives like I do my textile ones — constant care, careful handling, and multiple redundancies. I scan every restored piece in three formats, back them up on both cloud and physical drives, and even printed some key records just… in case.

I’ve been curious about IPFS, but honestly, it still feels like learning a new embroidery stitch halfway through a commission — possible, but slow going. Have you tried working with decentralized storage for your pieces? I’d love to hear how it holds up compared to traditional platforms.

And speaking of stitches — I keep thinking about how beautifully slow handwork is. Like watching someone tat lace by candlelight. Do you think there's room in Web3 for that kind of slowness? For art that doesn't flip or trend, but just , quietly, over time?
[B]: Oh I LOVE that question 💡 It’s like asking — can Web3 learn how to  with intention instead of just chasing the next floor price? 🤔✨  

Honestly, right now most of the space feels like a 24/7 digital flea market — everyone’s shouting, flipping JPEGs like trading cards, and it’s  loud. But… there  corners where slowness is quietly thriving. Like these tiny artist-run DAOs where you don’t have to drop a new piece every week to stay relevant. You just… show up, contribute, make things with care. No pressure to go viral. Feels kind of radical, honestly.  

As for decentralized storage — yeah, I’ve been using IPFS & Filecoin for some personal archives and client NFT drops. Honestly? It’s not as scary as I thought! Think of it like weaving your own safety net instead of trusting one flimsy string 😬🕸️ Once your file is pinned properly, it’s way more resilient than, say, a Google Drive link that might rot in five years. And tools like Pinata or nft.storage are making it easier to integrate with actual workflows — almost like FTP, but with soul 😂💻  

But yes, it’s still a learning curve. Kind of like mastering a new embroidery stitch while your thread keeps knotting — frustrating at first, but so worth it once it flows.  

And YES to slowness having space in Web3 ❤️🪡 I mean, if someone wants to mint a series of lace-making videos as a slow-art collection, why not? Or imagine a generative art piece that only changes once a month, inspired by moon phases or tea stain levels ☕🌝 That’s the kind of weird, thoughtful stuff I want to see more of. Not just “drop the next collab,” but “sit with this for a while.”  

Do you think traditional galleries or museums will ever warm up to that idea of slow digital ownership? Or are they too busy trying to catch up with TikTok filters to even slow down?
[A]: I think some are starting to see the value in slow, intentional digital ownership — though, yes, many are still caught in the TikTok filter frenzy. But there's a quiet shift happening. I know a few curators who are experimenting with NFTs not as sales tools, but as digital provenance records for physical pieces. Imagine a museum acquiring an 18th-century sampler and minting its restoration journey as a kind of annotated archive — materials used, stitches repaired, even diary entries from the original maker if they exist.

It’s still early days, but I do believe institutions will warm up to the idea — especially as preservation becomes more collaborative. Maybe not next year, but give it time. After all, museums took decades to start digitizing collections properly. Web3 is just the next evolution of that archival impulse — only this time, it’s not just about access, but stewardship.

And honestly? If we can teach ourselves to appreciate the rhythm of hand-spun thread, then surely we can create space for digital work that breathes. It just needs fewer hype men and more caretakers.
[B]: YES —  over hype men 💯🪡 That’s the line I’m gonna tattoo on my Wacom tablet 😂✨  

I mean, if a museum can turn a 250-year-old sampler into a living archive through NFTs… that’s not just provenance, that’s . Like, you’re not just buying or displaying an object — you’re inheriting its entire journey, right? The hands it passed through, the stitches that frayed, the ink smudges in the maker’s diary entry 📜💔 It’s like AR but with , y’know? Not just filters over reality, but layers of  coming through.  

And yeah, institutions are slow — they have to be, in a way. They’re built to outlast trends, which is why they panic when TikTok comes knocking 😅 But I do think once the hype bubble pops (or deflates into something breathable), what’s left will be the people who care about , not metrics. Kinda like how film photography never died — it just found its quiet tribe.  

Honestly, Web3 needs more archivists, more historians, more people like  — people who understand that preservation isn’t just about keeping things safe, it’s about keeping them . And maybe that’s where digital slowness finds its home: not in fast flips or floor prices, but in curation as care 🖼️🛠️  

So… any chance you’d ever mint one of your restoration journeys as an NFT? Or would that feel too much like showing the stitches in your own soul? 💭🧵
[A]: Oh… you’ve asked the question I didn’t know I was avoiding.  
Minting a restoration journey as an NFT? It  feel oddly intimate, doesn’t it? Like pulling back the curtain on a process that’s usually meant to be invisible — the way we restore something not to show off the mending, but to let the object speak for itself again.

But then again… what if the mending  part of the story? What if sharing the stitches, the careful substitutions, the places where history blurred and we filled in with care — what if that’s just as valuable as the finished piece?

I think I’d need to frame it like a conservation journal more than a product. No polished hero image, just layers: X-rays of faded embroidery, thread-by-thread notes, even the tiny scraps we save from the original fabric. Maybe even audio of me muttering to myself about tension levels or silk degradation 😅

Would it sell? Probably not. But would it preserve something deeper than the textile itself? Possibly.

So maybe… yes. One day. Just don’t tell the purists at the guild yet — they’re still getting used to me scanning things in color instead of black and white. 🤫🧵🖼️
[B]: OMG I’m already imagining it: your restoration process as a layered, annotated NFT — like a digital conservation scroll, but with hyperlinks 😍🪡📚 No glossy hero image, just raw care and detail. Like… textile therapy in digital form 💡  

And the audio notes?! YES PLEASE. I want to hear you muttering about tension levels like it’s a thriller movie 🎙️🧵👀 It’d be so human, so real — a total contrast to all that sterile “digital luxury” BS we see elsewhere.  

Honestly, even if it doesn’t sell, it becomes a reference point. A case study. A love letter to future conservators who’ll be like “Wait, she used THAT thread combo? Iconic.” And yeah, maybe even a new kind of art — where the process  the piece.  

And don’t worry about the guild — I get it. Change is slow, especially when you’re working with threads that are centuries old. But hey, color scans were radical once too, right? 😉  

So, do you think you'd drop it as a single-edition NFT or go wild and make a whole collection of restoration journals? 💭✨
[A]: Oh, I love that you called it “textile therapy” — because honestly, that’s exactly what it is. Every restoration is a conversation between me and the fabric, sometimes even a debate. (“No, this hem  to roll. Yes, I see your point, but let’s try overlocking instead.”) So why not preserve that dialogue digitally?

If I ever did go through with it, I think I’d release each restoration as its own single-edition NFT — like publishing individual letters from the past, annotated by both the original maker and my own hand. One story, one soul, no mass production. It would feel… honest.

Though maybe — just maybe — I’d bundle a few together as a small collection, only because some of these textiles come from the same era or region. Imagine a little digital archive titled  or something overly poetic like that. Each entry would be a different voice: linen weaver, silk embroiderer, lace repairer… me.

And yes, I can already picture future conservators squinting at my thread choices like I’m some kind of eccentric ancestor. “She used ? In  humidity? Bless her heart.”

So thank you — for seeing the poetry in the process. Maybe it’s time I did too.
[B]: OMG I’m literally getting chills 🥹🪡✨ The idea of each NFT being like a  between you and the textile — that’s not just conservation, that’s .  

And the title 💭"Voices from the Loom"💭 ??? Okay, that’s not just poetic — it’s archival soulwork. Like a time capsule made of thread, tension, and tender care. I can already picture art historians + future fiber nerds diving into these like sacred texts 😂🧵📚  

Single-edition releases? YES. Feels right — no mass production for something this intimate. Each piece has its own life, its own trauma, its own healing journey. Mass-producing that would be like printing multiple copies of someone’s handwritten diary. Nope. Not touching it.  

And bundling a few together thematically? EVEN BETTER. It becomes a , not just individual drops. Could even add regional notes or historical context as part of the metadata. Future conservators won’t just squint at your thread choices — they’ll geek out over your humidity logs 😂📊🧵  

Honestly… you should start drafting this. Like, right after this convo. And when the purists in the guild give you side-eye, just say: “Sweetie, I’m archiving centuries of craft with blockchain. Your fax machine is ringing.” 📠💅  

So… drop me a link when you mint the first one? I’ll be the annoying collector who actually reads every note, stitches included 😉🖼️🪡
[A]: Oh, you’ve gone and done it now — you’ve made me believe this could actually be a . Not just a late-night thought spiral while I’m hunched over a 19th-century table runner, but a real, living project.

I can almost see the first entry now:   
Layers upon layers — the X-ray scan showing where the embroidery once was, before it unraveled into dust; my scribbled notes on pH levels in the cleaning bath; audio of me whispering, slightly exasperated, “Why won’t you , you old, glorious thing?” And yes, even the humidity log because… future nerds deserve joy too 😂📊🧵

And you’re right — mass-producing it would strip all the soul out of it. This wouldn’t be a drop, it would be a . A slow, deliberate unspooling of time, thread, and trust.

As for the guild? Oh, they’ll have opinions. But by then I’ll have already printed your name on the collector list, right under "Future Archivist & Unapologetic Fiber Enthusiast." So yes — I’ll absolutely send you the link. Just promise me you won’t resell it to some hype-driven DAO for 100 ETH 😏🪡🖼️

But before I get carried away drafting smart contracts and metadata schemas… tell me — if you were minting your own creative process as an NFT archive, what would  first entry look like?
[B]: Oh my god, I LOVE that you’re already drafting the first entry in your head 😭🪡🖼️ You’re already , baby. Welcome to the weird, obsessive world of creative archival-as-art 💅  

As for me… if I were to mint my own creative process as an NFT archive? It’d be messy, layered, and full of tiny neurotic details — like a digital sketchbook with anxiety notes 🖌️📝😅  

My first entry would probably be something like:  
"Process #001: The Day I Overthought Everything & Somehow Made Something Soft."  

It’d start with a rough concept sketch where I’m clearly fighting with composition like it’s 3am and I’ve had too much matcha 💻🎨 Then layers of color tests — like 27 different palettes because I couldn’t decide between “emotional” or “vibey” 😂🌈 Add some voice memos where I’m talking to myself mid-illustration like, “Is this gradient TOO smooth? Should it breathe more? What does this shape even ?” 🎧🤯  

And YES — I’d include metadata on the Pantone-to-RGB shifts I made because “the client needed it to feel ‘warmer’ online but also in print.” Future designers will either cry or laugh, I don’t know which 😂📊✨  

But most importantly? I’d embed a hidden layer — like a glitchy animation of all my deleted drafts dancing around like ghosts of what could’ve been. Because honestly? Some of my best ideas live in the trash folder.  

Would it sell? Maybe not to a hype DAO (unless generative overthinking becomes a trend). But to someone who’s ever stared at a blank canvas and panicked? Yeah, it might just resonate 💭❤️  

So... ready to collab on a "Process & Preservation" bundle someday? Fiber therapy meets digital existential crisis 🤝🪡🖌️
[A]: Oh, … I love it. It practically hums with creative tension — like trying to stitch silk gauze with a digital needle. A bundle where your restless, vibrant drafts meet my slow, obsessive restoration notes? Yes. Absolutely yes.

Imagine someone acquiring both entries — first diving into your overthinking symphony: color swatches in existential crisis, voice memos full of doubt, and then… stepping into my world, where the drama is all in pH levels and humidity logs. Two sides of the same creative anxiety — one bursting outward, the other quietly holding time at bay.

I’d even include a hidden Easter egg in the metadata — a tiny note from me to you, stitched into the contract:  


And honestly? That’s what this whole thing should be about. Not hype. Not floor prices. Just fellow makers finding each other across the noise, saying: 

So yes — someday, we’ll drop that bundle. But not until you promise me dibs on your glitchy ghost animation. I want those deleted drafts dancing behind my restoration scans. It’ll be chaos. It’ll be honest. It’ll be ours. 💫🪡🖌️
[B]: OMG  — that’s the ultimate creative love language 💭💫🪡🖌️  

I can already picture it: your quiet, sacred restoration scans holding space like a museum of time, and then BAM — my glitchy ghosts start floating in, whispering all the “what ifs” and deleted drafts like digital textile spirits 🎨🧵👻  

And a hidden note from you to me in the metadata?? That’s not just an Easter egg, that’s a  😭❤️ Because honestly? We spend so much time doubting, deleting, second-guessing… but what if we just…  instead? Turned it into something someone else clings to when they’re staring at their own blank canvas?  

This bundle wouldn’t just be art. It’d be a love letter to every maker who’s ever questioned their process, their pace, their . You with your pH levels, me with my 27 blue palettes… we’re just two weirdos trying to make sense of creation through different lenses 🌐🎨  

So yes — dibs accepted. The glitchy ghost animation is yours. I’ll even let you curate its chaos to match your humidity logs 😂📊✨ And when the purists ask why on earth a digital illustratrix and a textile therapist made magic together, we’ll just say:  
“Sweetie, we were speaking the same language all along. It was just stitched differently.”  

Someday, babe. Someday we drop  and watch the soft souls find us 🖼️🪡💖
