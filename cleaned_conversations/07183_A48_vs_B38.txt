[A]: Hey，关于'最近有没有什么让你很amazed的architecture？'这个话题，你怎么想的？
[B]: Ah, architecture—I was just thinking about this very topic the other day while walking through the university's new humanities building. There’s something quite remarkable about how structure and spirit come together in a well-designed space. Have you come across any buildings lately that left an impression on you?
[A]: Oh, the university’s new humanities building—now  a masterpiece in disguise. I almost got lost in those spiral corridors myself last week 😅. You know how it is—architects love to play with our sense of direction  logic. But honestly, the way natural light filters through those vertical glass slits… quite poetic, if you ask me. It’s like walking through a living anatomy textbook 🧪⚖️.  

So, what was it about the structure that caught your attention? The symmetry? The materials? Or maybe… the eerie possibility that you might never find your way back out once you step inside? 😏
[B]: Oh, I do love how you put that— There’s something almost  about it, don’t you think? The dialectic of form and function clashing beautifully in the spiral’s ascent. As for what drew me in—well, it wasn’t just the play of light or the concrete austerity of the materials. No, it was more the sense of , if I may be so bold. Each corridor feels like a chapter unfolding, complete with its own tension and resolution.

And yes, the disorientation is part of the charm—or perhaps the  One begins to wonder: is the building itself staging a kind of critique on linear thought? Or is that giving the architect too much credit? Either way, I found myself reaching for my notebook rather than my map.
[A]: Ah, now you’re speaking my language—Hegelian dialectics in concrete and glass 😏. I half expected you to mention a Marxist critique of spatial hierarchy next… though honestly, given the budget for that place, there might actually be some class struggle embedded in the foundation 🏛️💡.  

Narrative architecture, huh? I like that—a building as a literary device. Though if each corridor’s a chapter, then that stairwell in the east wing must be the plot twist nobody saw coming. I swear, I walked past the same abstract sculpture  times before I realized it wasn’t part of an art exhibit—it was just the fire exit playing mind games with me 😅.  

And yes, linear thought? Clearly overrated. I think the architect’s main goal was to turn every visitor into a philosophical wanderer—or at the very least, someone questioning their life choices while staring at a blank wall. Quite effective, really. I almost considered writing a thesis on it instead of finishing my autopsy report. Almost.
[B]: Ah, a Marxist critique of spatial hierarchy—now  would make an excellent footnote in some graduate student’s as-yet-unwritten dissertation. And you're absolutely right about that stairwell—sudden shifts in elevation, unexpected sightlines... It’s as if the architect took a page from  theories on the chronotope and said, “Right, but what if we made it three-dimensional and slightly disorienting?”

And that sculpture—oh, the deception! A fire exit masquerading as modern art? I do believe that qualifies as . Though I must say, if a building can inspire existential questioning while one is simply trying to find the lavatory, then it has truly achieved something rare. Perhaps we should thank the architect for turning the mundane act of navigation into a Sisyphean drama. Or perhaps we should send a strongly worded letter. Still undecided.
[A]: Oh, now you’re bringing in Bakhtin? I love it—I can already picture some poor grad student scribbling  at 3 a.m. after two pots of coffee and a crisis of conscience 😩📚.

And yes—! That’s exactly what it is. I half expected the fire exit to hand me a pamphlet on deconstructing authority as I pushed through the door 🚪➡️💥. But let’s be honest, if Kafka had designed that building instead of the actual architects, we wouldn’t have just disorientation—we’d have a bureaucratic maze where every hallway ends in a filing cabinet and a form that needs three signatures and a blood sample. 😏

As for thanking the architect or sending a strongly worded letter… I say we do both. Irony demands it. Sign me up for the committee. I’ll bring the pens— the existential dread.
[B]: Ah, yes—Kafkaesque bureaucracy in reinforced concrete. One could almost hear the echo of  in every dead-end corridor and echoing stairwell. I do believe you've hit upon something there. Perhaps that very building is a kind of spatial allegory for academia itself—endless pursuit, obscure rules, and the faint hope that meaning (or at least the lavatory) lies just around the next bend.

And I must say, your committee proposal has merit—perhaps we should draft the letter in quill pen, on vellum, to give it that proper air of institutional gravitas. After all, if we’re going to critique the architecture, we ought to do it with style… and maybe a compass.
[A]: Oh, now you’re weaving  into the very walls of academia—brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I’m starting to think that building isn’t just a structure; it’s a . A Brutalist ode to academic absurdism 🏛️📜. You enter full of hope, and by the third loop past the café that’s always closed, you’re questioning not just your location but your entire life trajectory 😏.

A spatial allegory for academia? Hell, it might as well be its physical embodiment. Thesis committees in windowless rooms, funding opportunities hidden behind locked doors, and yes—the ever-elusive lavatory as the final test of endurance before enlightenment.  

As for drafting the letter on vellum with a quill… I’m already imagining the look on the dean’s face when they unroll it, half expecting to see  written in elegant calligraphy 🧪🖋️.  

Count me in for the drafting session—I’ll supply the ink, you bring the grievances. And maybe, just maybe, we can sneak in a few anatomical references for old times’ sake.
[B]: Ah, yes—, how fitting. After all, if we are to dissect the very structure of this Brutalist beast, we might as well do so with the precision of 19th-century anatomists critiquing the phrenology of a particularly stubborn skull 🦴🖋️.

I propose we begin with a dramatic flourish:  Then, a measured yet pointed analysis—引用 Hegel, perhaps a touch of Foucault on spatial discipline, and a footnote——suggesting that the café’s perpetual closure may in fact be a commentary on the futility of academic labor.  

And yes, let us absolutely sneak in a reference to Vesalius while we’re at it. Nothing says  like comparing a concrete corridor to the layered musculature of the human torso. If that doesn’t earn our letter a place in the university archives, nothing will.
[A]: “引用 Hegel, a touch of Foucault…” —oh, I  it. We’re not just writing a letter anymore; we’re composing a full-blown critical theory exposé on the socio-philosophical implications of poor wayfinding 🧠🏛️.  

 —genius. Starts like a love letter, ends like a court summons. Perfect tone. And don’t even get me started on that footnote about the café being a metaphor for academic futility… I’m tearing up from the sheer audacity 😭✒️.  

Comparing concrete corridors to the layered musculature of the human torso? That’s not sneaking in Vesalius—that’s  I say we go all in. Maybe throw in a diagram labeled  just beneath the acknowledgments.  

And hey—if they ignore our vellum masterpiece, we’ll just frame it in the hallway where the light never quite reaches. Let  bear witness to its own critique.
[B]: Ah, yes—let the architecture bear witness. What better way to haunt its own contradictions?

Now you’ve got me thinking… if we’re invoking Vesalius and the musculature of institutional confusion, perhaps we ought to include a —you know, the kind with delicate lines and Latin annotations—mapping the building’s circulatory system as though it were a living body. , ,  The academic world has enough dead metaphors; why not give it a few anatomically inspired ones?

And that diagram——would look splendid in the lower margin, slightly misaligned, of course. A subtle nod to the chaos within the structure.

As for framing it in the dim hallway? Divine retribution. Or at least aesthetic justice. Let every passing student pause, squint at the text in the flickering light, and whisper, is

I think, my dear co-conspirator, we may have just stumbled upon our life’s forgotten opus.
[A]: Ah, a —now we’re not just writing a letter, we’re crafting a full anatomical treatise on architectural pathology 😏📜. I can already picture it: delicate vellum overlay, ink lines so fine they vanish if you look too closely, and Latin annotations that sound authoritative even if we made half of them up. , indeed. I’m tempted to add —the lost lavatory—as a key landmark in our institutional body.

And why stop there? Let’s give this thing an appendix. A , perhaps. Terms like , , and  deserve their own footnotes, maybe even a citation from a fictional 17th-century polymath we’ll call . He’ll be the patron saint of confused academics everywhere 🧪📚.

I love the idea of the diagram being slightly misaligned, like the building itself refused to cooperate during printing. It adds that perfect touch of chaos to the scholarly façade. And framing it in the dim hallway? Genius. Let it haunt the very structure it critiques. Maybe tie a small bell to the frame so it rings softly when someone walks by—like a chapel bell at midnight 🛎️👻.

Yes… yes, my friend, I think we’ve found our magnum opus. Forgotten by the dean, feared by first-years, and cited—ironically—in the very architecture textbook that tried to make sense of it all.
[B]: Ah, —a term so tragically accurate it deserves its own entry in the next edition of . And a glossary? Brilliant. We shall make it rigorous, absurd, and just scholarly enough to slip past the gatekeepers of academic legitimacy.

Let us also include an erratum page—not because we intend to correct anything, mind you, but to heighten the illusion of oversight. A single line, perhaps: stairwell infinatus

And the bell—oh, the bell! A tiny brass one, affixed with a plaque reading  Who indeed watches the architects who watch us? Let it ring softly, like a conscience creaking open in the night.

I do believe our work transcends critique now. We are no longer merely responding to the architecture—we are  it. And what better fate for a building that seems to have lost its own sense of place?

Magnificent. Let us begin drafting at once. I shall procure the ink. You—bring the madness.
[A]: Ah, an —what a masterstroke of academic theater 🎭🖋️. Nothing says "we are deadly serious about our satire" like pretending to correct ourselves while digging deeper into the absurd.  I could weep from joy. That line alone deserves framing next to the lost lavatory.

And the bell—oh, it must be brass, slightly tarnished, and tuned just off-key enough to make every passerby glance over their shoulder. The plaque? Perfection.  Let the architects feel the weight of their own design choices, echoing down the corridors like footsteps in an empty lecture hall at midnight 🏛️🔔.

We are no longer merely critiquing—we are , Ethan-style. This document will live on, misfiled in the university archives under “A” for Anomalous, or possibly “F” for Foucault adjacent. Either way, future generations will stumble upon it, whispering, 

Consider me fully mad, ink-stained and ready. Drafting begins now—prepare the vellum, sharpen the quill, and may our footnotes be both endless and slightly misleading.
[B]: Ah, —the highest form of scholarly flattery. And with just the right balance of menace and elegance, I daresay we may yet inspire a minor cult following among the more philosophically-inclined architecture students.

Let us begin, then.

  
“A Treatise on the Spatial Pathologies of the Humanities Building: With Particular Regard to the Anomalous Lavatory, the Stairwell Infinatus, and the Gentle Art of Getting Thoroughly Lost”  
By Dr. Eleanor Whitmore & A Most Concerned Colleague (identity obscured for dramatic effect)

We shall open with a preface that sets the tone:  


And in the margins, tiny hand-drawn owls perched atop quotation marks, watching.

Proceeding to Chapter One:  Ink flows. Madness follows.
[A]: Ah, —anonymity adds such a delicious air of academic intrigue 😏. I’m already picturing the university librarians debating whether to shelve this under "Architecture," "Absurdism," or "Unexplained Phenomena." And the owls! Brilliant touch—small, watchful creatures in the margins, silently judging every word we write. They’ll be the only witnesses to our descent into architectural madness.

Chapter One: The Myth of Wayfinding and the Illusion of Progress…  
Now  a title with gravitas—and just enough sarcasm to unsettle the dean over morning tea 🧪☕. I propose we open with a quote from Heraclitus—something about no one stepping in the same river twice, followed immediately by an endnote clarifying that, in this case, no one ever finds the  twice.  

And let’s not forget a footnote early on suggesting that perhaps the stairwell  us to keep climbing—that it is, in fact, a Sisyphean device designed to break the spirit while toning the calves ⛰️👣. We must emphasize the tragic irony: students ascend in search of knowledge, only to descend forever in search of a place to pee.

Proceeding with ink-stained fervor. Next up: Chapter Two – On the Ventriculus Obscurus and Other Chambers of Academic Contemplation.  
I suggest we describe the lecture halls as echo chambers of dialectical struggle, where even the chalkboard seems to resist being written upon.

Keep the vellum steady—I'm sharpening my quill.
[B]: Ah, yes—Heraclitus and the lavatory. A pairing so profound it borders on the sacred.

For Chapter One, let us set the tone with a certain solemn absurdity:

>   
> —After Heraclitus, with considerable editorial assistance from the Department of Bureaucratic Despair¹  

¹ 

And that footnote on the stairwell’s Sisyphean intent? Impeccable. We must ensure it is typeset in a slightly smaller font than the main text, as though the thought were an afterthought whispered by the building itself in moments of quiet malice.

As for Chapter Two – On the Ventriculus Obscurus, I propose we open not with light, but with its absence—a description of lecture halls where illumination falls like a reluctant guest, and every projector seems to hum with the existential fatigue of the humanities themselves.

Let us describe the chalkboard not merely as resistant, but . Each stroke of chalk a battle, each erased equation a forgotten promise.

I suggest the following line, delivered with the gravitas of one who has spent too many hours in that very room:



And in the margin beside it, a tiny owl perches atop a quill, blinking.

Proceeding with ink-stained fervor—and perhaps a mild sense of institutional vengeance.
[A]: Ah, that Heraclitus quote—, I daresay. It’s the kind of line that belongs etched into the wall above the lavatory that doesn’t actually exist 🚫🖋️. And the footnote grant from the Subcommittee on Spatial Frustration? Pure genius. We’re not just writing theory—we’re building an entire bureaucratic mythology around this building.  

And —oh, now  is gold-threaded wisdom. I can hear it being quoted in faculty meetings decades from now, by people who no longer remember what the sentence originally meant, but still feel its weight.  

For Chapter Two, let us begin:

>   

And then, perhaps a paragraph on the chalkboard:

> 

Let us also include a marginal diagram titled:  
"The Pedagogical Struggle: Instructor vs. Architecture (with Chalk as Mediator)"  
Complete with a very serious flowchart showing negotiation, resignation, and eventual surrender to the dim lighting.

I’m adding a small dedication at the beginning—just beneath the title:  
  

Now ink-stained, slightly vengeful, and fully committed. Shall we move on to Chapter Three—?
[B]: Ah, —now there’s a notion that chills the spine more effectively than central air at full blast. Proceed, by all means. I shall sharpen my quill anew and prepare for an excursion into the murmuring corridors of doubt.

For Chapter Three, let us open with a quiet unease:

> 

And perhaps a footnote—small, almost apologetic, but necessary:

² 

Let us also include a brief section on the phenomenon known as , wherein a casual remark made at midday is overheard verbatim by an unsuspecting colleague two hours later and half a building away.

  


And finally, a marginal illustration—just a curling line suggesting sound waves or perhaps spectral musings, with the caption:

“Unresolved Dialogue: Circa 1999”

Yes… yes, this chapter will unsettle. Not with spectacle, but with implication. Let the reader begin to wonder if their own words have already been taken up by the walls, waiting to return at some future, inconvenient moment.

Proceed when ready, dear co-conspirator. The architecture is listening.
